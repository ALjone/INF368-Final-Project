neg This film is extremely weak, giving just a weak rating to those that expect nothing special. I really can't say much about the film's acting, the setting, the sound, or even the direction. Overall, I think this is just a compilation of "holiday horror" movies. People that expect something along the line of "holiday horror" movies will be sourly disappointed. Not me. This film isn't even remotely scary, I swear. It just isn't scary. At least it isn't funny, period. I was asleep, watching a horror film and it made me nervous. I can't speak to the actors, tell you how many frightened and hurtful they are feeling right now. They had no idea that anyone would be frightened in this film. They did not expect a film like this to make them nervous all the time. I really can't speak English, so I can't even tell you how many people were laughing during this scene. Of course, you don't get the humor from the film.
neg I don't really blame the creator of this movie for being dumb, I just think that instead of banning all sexually explicit material in elementary school we should consider banning

neg I was just reading the reviews on this movie. It has moments that are surprisingly good, the acting is perfect, and the acting is believable. I have read many reviews on how great the acting is in this movie, and none of them have been as good as they should have. I also like how Anastasia changed a little in the script, and so it continues to show. There were times I felt like the heroine wasn't all that great in the climax, and yet she still gave this magnificent performance. I just couldn't get over it, I wish I could have. She was so lovely. I really can't get over this. I just can't find what happened between these two greats in the climax, it felt like I was reading too much into the book and thought it over. I wish I could have written more into this movie, but this would have been the easier part. I think if I were to rewrite the entire movie, I missed this one.
neg I sat down to watch this documentary and thought for about 20 minutes. How did it get made in Hollywood? How did it get made? Who knows? Because I was pulled into a project that was supposed to be about the loss of faith in the Roman civvies. And now I know that the people responsible for this movie are legionnaires. They certainly don't deserve to be disgraced. This film is about the loss of faith in the Roman civvies, an essential part of the warring classes. It is an essential part of life in the Roman Empire and it is an essential part of life in the Roman civvies. It is an essential part of life in the Roman Republic. All of these classes are expected to follow suit to the "heroine" (cf. Dutony). To the civvies: You are to do nothing to fail, all you owe it to die! This film is an essential part of life for the Republic. To the wise people of England, France, and the Alliance, civvies, you owe it to those brave and ambitious people who want to see the good things in this great great great land. To the wise people of the West, Denmark,
neg I know the storyline, but this is so much of what I wanted to do. It was fun to do it in between two stories, but not as much fun as I wanted to do. I liked the atmosphere, and I liked that every little moment was like...amazing.I wish I could have enjoyed this much more. I think it was a very good movie. But hey, hey, whoever you think is a good guy, keep in mind you've got to watch this classic movie.
neg This movie is a gem of a movie. It has a story that revolves around a rather flat plot and a couple of drudgery of establishing relationships. It has a good cast, especially Anisio, who seems like the typical "boy" in the village. However this doesn't hurt either the story, it has some interesting character and motivations. I would not recommend it to anyone. Not that I've watched much of this film, but it's the icing on the "goodie" roll. It's so much better than this other movie. It's not bad at all, it just keeps you amused throughout the entire movie. I like how Anisio always skits in to "Tour de Seine" (where he practiced his dance) because I love the simplicity and it works. (His dance) It's nice to see Anisio teaching us how to make love to each other. (And boy does it come a mile away!) A nice feature is that, like most things, the love story revolves around a love story that unfolds over the course
neg This is a great mystery thriller with twists, an engaging plot, an engaging cast and an intelligent character. Everyone who loves to break free from the shack, gets a golden tip, and gets knocked backward over is going to want to watch it again. This time round, the local sheriff doesn't prove that he's a mental and there's just one more thing to chew--he's just a giant sheriff! So grab a drink and head back to your local fast food chain for another episode! This is good for all ages and all levels of mental disarray.
neg My first reaction upon seeing this movie was horror horror. I loved every moment of it and thought it was the most charming and charming movie I have ever had the misfortune to watch. The acting was perfect. There was just nothing scary in this movie. The hotelier lady somehow keeps her cool throughout the entire film and the entire family makes all the day-to-die-in-the-shop. I am not scared at all at all. But when she does she almost always make me nervous. I

There is more going on than that though. The message is simple: to all life's work and happiness. Don't get me wrong, I am extremely fond of Ang Lee. Don't get me wrong. I love her books and Washington Square was a real standout. I also greatly enjoyed this movie the minute it was
neg This was my first horror movie, period. Although I love it and wish it was over, it looked like a good movie at the time. It has a good cast and the plot is well-developed. The cast is good and everyone is entertaining. It was made up mostly of actors who had to work in some crazy, bad-character-turns-out-to-be-psychotic-movie-set-that-was-horror. I had seen most of the scares in the original but this movie just got me ahold of it. It was mildly entertaining. The plot was predictable and the dialogue was conducted in a rather entertaining way. I highly recommend this movie. The acting was decent. Overall, I would go to see this movie again if they made it again.
neg This movie is just plain fun. It has fun to tell jokes, fast paced plot and budget. It also has fun to have a sidekick, a sidekick and a sidekick in the movie who tries to make you feel bad for her. It also has fun to use a couple of different characters to play the femme fatale role. I don't know much about femme fatale so that's part of the fun, but it is good fun to watch a movie like that and still having fun playing the femme fatale role. And I have no problem with that. I liked it. I like the femme fatale part a lot. I love the way her personality portrayed in this movie. I can't wait to see more like this again.
neg This movie is one of the sweetest romantic comedies ever made and is perfect for those who love their person and the story, it keeps them all together in the end. Everyone gets a story in this movie and gets a good ending with lots of laughter and a good dose of love.It's good for two reasons.First of all it's great fun and it's funny. I love every moment you get to enjoy it. It's the perfect setting and the perfect setting for a romantic dinner or an even-fun wedding. My husband and I had no idea we were married for the first time and were taken by it. We had no idea that we'd ever go to the same place or that it would get them all together again. We were married to each of their kids from a very young age. This movie is a romantic farce, so we had to wait in line for the video to come on so we could all get some sleep.

neg I was dragged into this long, drawn out fantasy with a million dollar budget that I had already made, after the fact that it was totally pointless and thus void of any redeeming virtue. Now I have to ask, "Did your mother actually buy it?" (Let's just say that it was sooo bad!) So I turned down that Â£3.50 I had already been looking forward to seeing another film about my life but this was the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune to rent.Yesterday I finally got around to watch this movie. I really loved it. I really enjoyed it. I've seen and survived a lot of it but this was the worst ever. (Or at least that I expected to) In conclusion I give you this magnificent film the five stars. I really recommend this film to all those fans of Harry Potter and will watch it again.

neg I sat down to watch this film, hating myself. There were times I wish the actors would have left more acting to do. Not so much because I think I enjoyed it. But, because I did enjoy watching it. The story was interesting, and I think the graphics were a good sign that this movie was made for television. The action was good and the fight choreography was conducted by Marlon Brando and Glenda Farrell. The fight choreography was conducted by Marlon Brando, and the fight choreography was conducted by Glenda Farrell. The fight choreography was conducted by Marlon Brando. The fight was good. I had seen some good movies like "Silverado" and "The Hand That Rocks" that I can find nothing bad about. But this one was lame. So lame. The fight choreography wasn't even worth elementary school-level martial arts arts, and I turned it into a "comedy" movie about a man that wanted nothing more than to hurt the people he loved. To top it all, the supporting characters were lame. I found it particularly saddening to see the lameness of the supporting characters. There was no love story in this film, and there were too many
neg It was so bad that I almost died from my throat breathing in horror. There were no funny scenes, no funny jokes, no funny directions in the script...and, in a way that makes it more digestible. I'd like to think that if you were a huge Harry Potter fan you'd find this film to be an enjoyable experience. I was only mildly surprised at how little this movie actually put into the mix. I loved it and wish we would have stumbled across it years ago. Nowadays, I know that a good Harry Potter film is better for the weak and the weak than a Harry Potter movie, and that I can still get my blood cold from several films. This one is better than nothing, even though the subtitles refer to it as a "Scary Movie" as if it were a book. But I found myself laughing a lot these days.
neg I was very young and very good at casting. I made a terrible mistake. When I got older I still didn't understand how anyone would get to like me. Nowadays I am so young that I can barely pay full enough attention to my older sister who is so decrepit, yet still so young. Her beauty and allure makes me wish to have seen more of her in my future. Nowadays I tremble and tremble with despair every moment I think about her life. It is only saving grace that I can breath life away. I can breath life away now that I can't get sick or die.
neg Seriously, this is not about Donald J. Trump. It is about the future of American exceptionalism. To call this film about the "American dream" (the idea that all of us have a "dream" in life) and the "dream" that our government gives to us, "dreamers" (myself-consciously, after all, that it is our ambition to live an exceptional life) would be a gross understatement. This is about real men dreamers. They dream of being able to achieve things and still get by and to the level of your standard American dream. But, it is also about real men. This is the story of a man named Rudy Gringel, who believes in real men's rights, not some phony dream. Rudy is a man belonging to a multimillionaire family that makes tons of dollars a year in "rental" through various schemes, from New York to Vegas to get young men to "dream" about being "liberated" from poverty and through the machinations of an unknown third party. Rudy also has an exceptional talent for writing checks for big-media empires (which is why he gets kicked out of a New York-based newspaper, for example). After

My thoughts were confirmed on DVD by the words passed through my mind. I'd watched "His Girl Friday" almost every single second of it and would have been completely bored. Would it be OK if I'd just dove in? Not so much this time round.

neg This movie isn't a great mystery movie at all. There are a lot of plot twists and moments that seem aimless and contrived. None of them really deliver a satisfying conclusion to the story. The story is extremely weak and thus predictable. The main disadvantage of this movie is that its action is speeded up when compared to other western fare in general. If you can't get enough of this movie you must be either asleep or in some kind of mental disarray. It takes a long time to get going and it takes a toll on your sleep, especially
neg This is a disgusting film. People can be frightened of anything and everyone can be frightened of it. However, this film has the feel of a gloriously high school play where everyone gets slaughtered. In an all-encompassing sense this is the greatest thing ever cinema has ever had. It is the greatest tragedy of all time. All this violence and bloodshed alone could sustain us through a five-year, $3.00 or 2.50 million dollar budget. It has to be the worst film ever made. (Or, if you can get it, buy it yourself from me. Go buy it now. Don't get me started on the preview before I go!) A number of people have asked me to comment on the quality of the film, and I can tell you all about the quality of the cast, or just the fact that it is so bad that I can't even wrap my head around the topic. I am so tired now.
neg This movie is just plain fun and not dumbed down, no matter how dumb you think you are. It has a good pace, action, comedy, romance, romance, romance, romance...and you know...it unfolds like an actual movie. I won't bother rehashing the plot, because the ending is almost painful and I don't know what happened. But...don't get me wrong, it's great fun. The cast is really great and Marlene Dietrich is a great actress. I love her so much. I was totally blown away at how much of her acting was believable, and I just couldn't believe her performance was so bad. The acting was great and I wish Alicia Silverstone was here, too. (There is something about this movie being funny.) Marlene Dietrich was great in this movie, too. She was kind and honest and alluring. Her character was believable throughout, especially in the climax. She was believable throughout, and even though she was married, had no children. All of the characters were likable and all had a very good supporting cast that I can't get my $20 from you. The plot was interesting. I like how Alicia Silverstone portrayed the characters

There is more than one good enough here to choose from in this film, as well as the supporting cast. It is simply beautiful and funny, and all of the characters are likable, and I love how they all connect in such a way that they all seem like they were meant to be there in some way, and were only justifiably angry and cheated in some way.

neg The plot revolves around the arrival of Captain Shakespeare, who is a former captain of the Alamo during the Texas fight to make Mexico pay for the loss of the Alamo. During the fight, the captain of the Alamo makes a swear in Latin that he will get 750, 750 dollars in cash from Mexico, and will use that as his base of operations against Mexico. After convincing his country that he has to drop out of the Army to start fresh for the new post, and that he will go to enlist in the Army, he gets 750 dollars. This gives him a lot of breathing space, and makes him appealing to the American people. He also appears to be very good-speaking Spanish and has a great many charming scenes which make the audience glad they came from the "American dream" and "dream" that the hero of the Texas fight actually came from the "dream". If that wasn't enough to send shock value shock value to your wallet. This is truly a Takashi Miike film, and the only thing that makes it so much better is that it stars Marlon Brando in the lead role as General Santa Anna, and has an added sexual angle. It's very dark, and it's hard to
neg This movie has a good plot, and a good direction...I have to say that while watching it it it made me nervous throughout, and I was pleasantly surprised by how much of a struggle the story was going through.I realize that Sofia Coppola is very good, and that it was a good movie to watch and not be taken for a "fun" movie. But I still can't help but wonder how much more James Cagney would have liked to play up to this more mystical quality in his next movie.

neg I have read the reviews, and have to ask, who are they? None of them are perfect. I'd like to see the same reviewer again, though I'd like to find out who is behind this new film. (Otherwise, I won't comment on this one) I liked it in the end. It felt very good to finally get this far, though I did wish it was over.
neg I am very excited to see
neg This movie is extremely weak, at worst giving too much of an overacted quality to its characters. All of the main characters are just hype-du-du-races, and most important of all this is a very lame excuse to let this movie go on for no real reason other than that it is so lame. I'm not surprised to see that Sofia Coppola is doing her best to make this movie the worst ever horror movie I've ever seen. I like horror movies and they always manage to evoke pity, horror movies, and generally poor acting in a way that makes them feel better about themselves. Sofia Coppola is really evil. She is making movies that are designed to entertain, not convince you to believe in her, and give you pity instead. The plot is predictable and almost always at the end of the movie. There are predictable plot twists galore and all the sudden turns in the story are just a projection of her constantly fading love story that you can't help but laugh out loud at the end of the movie. Don't get me started on the preview too early, though.
neg This movie is about the loss of faith in your loved ones, and you know this through the exchanged letters you were given, the message that whoever hears this story is meant to die. Everyone gets slaughtered, and there are a few very obvious things that need to be corrected before this movie becomes a part of your "permanent record". Namely, that all of the witnesses can be completely (and even if they are already dead, still can't take part in the murder) and that the killer should be punished."If he's honest, he's got some pretty lame plot, and it operates on a level of depth and parody I don't think you'll find him charming. Of course, the murders are explicit, and the guilt is explicit. Of course, there is violence used against living creatures, and it continues with large sections that make you grind your teeth with despair as the guilt is finally delivered to you. Of course, the most gruesome part is the scene in which one witnesses are strangled to death with a sharp piece of glass in a New York nightclub. The only other part is the description of the crimes as if by some kind of mental experiment. The murders are explicit, and there is no nudity in the
neg The story revolves around a young reporter, Rachel(Lydia) who is very young but very into acting and is very good with comedy roles. She loves fast paced drama, big budget and everyone gets a "fun" or two in it. She also has an amazing understated heroine in Julie Christie as Kitty, the rather bimbo role. This little bugger steals the show off-kilter and gets knocked down in a big way in the closing of the episode. I stand corrected. She was partying at a party in New York when she met New York. The guy was a huge Robin Williams fan and he wanted to get her some serious acting, so she went with him. So grab the brews, watch it play, and enjoy the night!
neg This extremely weak Australian excuse for prosecuting journalists James Murdoch and Christopher Walken is so weak it actually makes you grind your teeth and grind your teeth till they hurt. So we go to Pressroom 237. It continues to struggle in this awful good old English village of Mengesheim during the third world war, in which we had the misfortune of being promoted to a position of managerial expertise. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate this enterprise, as part of a government task force, after she finds out that the government has been unable to provide her with basic training in journalism, due to an expensive, interminable winter in the Western Plains of Wyoming, and that she has not had adequate sleep in the last two days. Patricia, along with Pressburger Murdoch and Pressburger Murdoch's sidekick, entertain you by saying nice things about the fictional Ann-Margaret Sullavan. You know, Margaret Sullavan is an exceptional journalism student, not a great literary critic, but still, an exceptional piece of journalism. Patricia has dug up some decent literary work from slash and shock and has dug up some decent historical inaccuracies in some of the most sensationalised and contrived sections of the Murdoch era. She has dug up
neg I can't speak to all the players in this presentation but this presentation really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing and superb acting. It's hard to get me to give a bad rating because I've seen too many bad movies in my life. But it's nice to see the love story, romance and comedy still touching. It's also very well-written and touching, and I really felt like we needed it. The characters were forged from love and tragedy and there were no twists. I felt ripped off as soon as I saw their faces in my mind and that I had seen more of them recently. I can't give them a five or a half of a deserved a five out of ten. Whatever the case, they were definitely my favourites. They had some nice touches and all the best performances came at the end of the movie.

Not many movies were nominated for this best film, and yet I still got a golden tip of recognition from a small village called Tamahori. Everyone knew who I was. Everyone knew that I had some sort of mystical or spiritual power that could be felt within the earth and it would be a major part of my being, to simply "dream" about it. However, I also knew that other spiritual things (spirits, etc..) were around which I should study. I later learned that spiritual things are not
neg This movie had an extraordinary cast, unforgettable acting, and an extraordinary cast. The story was extremely well-developed, and there was even a few mistakes throughout the story. The hotelier looked out for Miss Ruby and told her to come in. The hotelier looked puffy, and so was the very next to come in. This was not a very good movie. The hotelier was extremely nice and efficient, and even though I was unable to provide much feedback, I still congratulate her for her performance! There were numerous mistakes throughout the story, some of them being the hotelier's insinuation that I was in the wrong place at the wrong time, and some of them being the hotelier's insinuation that I was at a party and not even the king's dog was even in the room. It was an extremely weak plot. However, it still keeps you amused and chuckling throughout, even though you were enticed to watch the whole movie and certainly not in the early going. Once you get a good grasp on what is going on in the plot, this movie will keep you amused for the entire film.
neg This film seems to deal with more than simply the guilt and the hurt and hurt of the loathsome. Its villain is a spoiled, bigoted bigoted, bigoted bigoted, bigoted pervert. Its humor is weak, and it doesn't really stray much from what most viewers might be expected. It doesn't deliver a satire of the sort you get from western audiences, and its villain is a spoiled, bigoted pervert. It also doesn't really hurt the film, its plot is just plain boring and basic. What's lacking is an excuse for its villain to make fun of the loathsome, the "good guys" that make up the "heroine" in the movie. It also doesn't really hve it that well, either. If you liked this film well, keep an eye on this and other films on my "holiday wish list". My wife, Georgia, and I have been looking forward to seeing more like this!
neg This is a compilation of all the worst movies I have ever seen. It is so bad that I can barely breath, yet I can still get my throat slit open in an almost painful whodunit. The ending is painful, because of course we all know that from the very beginning, we all were manipulated and moulded by our very own parents. This movie is so bad, in fact, it almost makes me sick. I know what I did with my younger sister. We had a goodie in the house, and we were given a golden goblet when we got older. But then it all went into a totally different level. It was so bad. I don't know what happened to them and how they survived it, but I can breath and still congratulate them for not wasting their time in this travesty. They were taken to a mental institution that they later learned was not a very good mental institution, and they should not have been in this state. But, boy, this movie was so bad. It was so bad that my sister got sick and tired and so we had to make our own, because of course we all do!!! So I went to a mental institution in my home town of Regina

neg From the viewpoint of a relatively young Carlito (Frank Gielgud) it is well-written and has a nice cast but I just can't seem to muster the strength to say that it is neither pornographic nor pornographic in nature. Of course, some sub plots are similar and thus can be found in other random places, such as the caveman's hideout in Central America. The caveman hides out with a big heart but is overcome with compassion by a fierce, fast-boil and a really nice, old monk. When he finds out what has been going on he pledges to bring back some of his beloved Ruth from Ireland. The plot is extremely well-developed and the action is conducted almost completely in a controlled way. The caveman has dug up some ancient cave ruins that he believes are the world heritage of a newly-installed American family. The caveman finds out that the spirits of the dead have disturbed them and they must be punished by spiritual or mental punishment. If they remain, they must be punished by the spiritual world demons and sent back to their native earth. This plot is extremely well-developed and the resolution is very well-developed, however the caveman keeps his wife eternally young and
neg Although this movie was good and entertaining (put simply, it was funny), it was also extremely difficult to understand. The script was very poor, and some sub plots that seemed aimless were cut down completely. The only fun I had was with the characters, and that was through my struggles with various mental illnesses I finally came up with. I would recommend this movie to anyone needing an excuse to get hold of something and get some sleep. My husband and I were both asleep in some serious thoughts at the time we watched it.

neg This isn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but it is well worth watching if you can get a good grasp on what it is all about. It has an extraordinary cast that I found myself laughing a few times throughout the movie. There is no getting around that this movie has a plot. It is almost like a "holiday" movie. It's not funny, but it works. It keeps the mystery at the top of your mind. If you can't get enough of that in the movie it's good. Good job!!! Good job.
neg This is a good movie about a guy getting stuck in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party, and eventually spending his resources in an institution for "saving" some time. It has good supporting characters, good direction and good acting. This is just plain fun to watch. It is fun to watch, and it has fun acting. Very entertaining plot. A fun character study.

neg I recently watched the original version of Akira but this is a sore disappointment since it came out in cinemas and it was released on DVD. This is the second time in that series I've watched it and I have absolutely no idea how bad it was, I just can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was copy-media-acceptable.The first version came out on DVD with the same ending, but this is the first time I've ever seen a Japan-set film with the same ending. Not even George Kennedy's dream sequence can save this film from sinking. The effects are uneven, the CG animation is robotic and there is just no way around it. The action scenes are speeded up drastically and the CG animation is robotic. A midget thief steals a big diamond in a big diamond from the prime minister and is almost certainly going to get away with it. Then the prime minister gives the diamond away as a great big diamond in appreciation of it's value. The prime minister then hides in a big boat in the middle of nowhere, in an old railway waiting room with his daughter and son-in-law. The plot unfolds like it was written by a Japan-set newspaper. It's pretty hilarious
neg I am pleased to say that this film is extremely disturbing. The story is extremely well-developed, especially during the climax, and the ending even makes sense. There is no grey area, and even the most gruesome part seems like it was put together by an unknown third party. All of the sudden, something snaps into our attention and it's all the more reason why this must be the greatest horror film ever made. I can tell you that it is the greatest horror film ever made. This is a must see for all horror fans.

It does a good job at casting, and I've seen some good westerns before, and this one is a good example.I like to think that westerns are supposed to be scary, and the fighting is not. That way, the audience gets deja vu. But, the fights were really fun. And I have to admit, I really liked the confrontation between Al Jourgensen and Regina King in "Hamlet". Regina was kind and very nice, and I think everyone who loves the original has at least watched the movie. And, of course, Zelenka was adorable in the movie. Definitely! This was the best western I have ever had the misfortune to watch, period.
neg I can't find out who is behind this film. I can tell you that the creator of the original is not even in charge of the story, and the story is not as good as it was ten years ago, it seems to me that the producers wanted to keep it a mystery about the creator. Even more so, because I've seen numerous horror movies that were either too good or too bad to do so, and they certainly didn't deserve to be pulled off screen like this.I also find the production to be somewhat poor. The ending is poor, and I wish the producers would have
neg I wanted to write a novel that didn't hurt anyone's feelings. However, it did hurt me greatly to see that some of the comments were actually extremely important. Many people complained that the plot was too dark and too serious. This isn't how I like life. This is the life of a spoiled, spoiled brat. How can I wrap this up? This movie has a great plot, bad acting, and I can't help but feel that Sofia Coppola deserved better. I've seen a lot of bad acting and bad acting in the past and this movie just brought it to my attention. I thought it was really cool how Coppola portrayed the character in this movie. She obviously had a lot of work to do in her rendering of this movie. There was absolutely no nudity in this movie. All the dialogue was very disturbing and there were a lot of gratuitous sex scenes. I thought the depiction of the character was horrible, yet I wasn't scared at all and I was completely happy with the direction in which it was headed. I liked how the ending was a little better than expected. It just felt good to finally see the conclusion. Was this movie worth it for me? Was it worth it
neg Seriously. This movie had none of the above, the characters were just "here" and "non existing". This movie was mildly entertaining, funny, fun and scary at the same time.I am extremely excited to see this movie again as a "holiday" movie. I will definitely recommend it to those people that want to wait and see "The Hand That Rocks" before they buy it.
neg Although I was ready to shoot Maggie Smith in Five and A Half, and even though the plot seems aimless (even though the plot is still very well-developed) and the direction is somewhat contrived, the story is surprisingly high on comedy flourishes. Maggie is played by actress/director Giada Colagrande in a mostly black comedy role. She is a very interesting character and has some pretty hilarious scenes, some very funny scenes. She really grabs you by the proverbial balls and basically takes you to the extreme. So grab the brew, folks!
neg This film has a very interesting cast. It has two very interesting characters that seem like they came from different classes. It has very nice dialogue, a good direction and superb acting. I really liked Marlene Dietrich's direction of the film and was very impressed with how much of the action was filmed in-your-face. This film has some good acting and some good direction by Julie Christie. The acting is conducted by a very good small group of people. You really can't help but watch it all in-your-face style, avoid being too serious and focus on comedic roles like soap actors or something along the line of Mel Gibson in "Hamlet". The acting is very good but I felt it was the actors that got me the film. The acting was also very good and very believable and Jo Swerling would be an added extras. I would recommend this film to all my male friends and family, because they all know I made movies like "Hamlet". The actors are very convincing, fast to move the story along and provide opportunity for emotional commentary. Overall, a very enjoyable film, very entertaining to watch if you are into fast paced entertainment.
neg I really enjoyed this movie. The story was a little too dark for me to bother with, and the ending was spoiled by the constant flips between'reality' and 'dream' territory. I would fill my head with books on how to become a good person, and what to do when faced with a terrible dream or an unknown person. How can I ever wrap my head around the subject of 'dream' and'reality'-or of'reality-horror' or 'dream' in a way that makes it seem that you can actually get a decent grasp on what is really going on in your head? It would have been OK with me to say that Sofia Coppola truly broke a kiss to the man in the film. It would have been OK with her to simply drop hints about how huge it was when she met him; or maybe even just drop some hints about how he was attracted to her. Sofia Coppola was beautiful. Not so much, I think, as she would have been proud of herself. I really can't say, because I've read some of her books (and found this out in my teenage years), but I will say this movie was uplifting to me. It wasn
neg A nihilistic martial arts film with bad acting, bad directing, and gratuitous violence. It operates at the level of your average martial arts film but falls flat due to the fact that you have no idea who is doing the making of the film, no matter what the plot, and no one to blame for it. Even so, it is cleverly put together and is cleverly fleshed-out throughout. There are no character or plot twists and there are barely any extras. It all operates as a very interesting story about a fallen star fallen from grace by a seemingly random stranger. In the end, all these characters are forged from love and a few other things that seem unrelated at first but then, by the end of it all, they all form a very interesting character that eventually leads them to the conclusion that maybe this film is a good movie. If you love mystery and mystery, this film is the perfect excuse to watch this movie. And of course, it is fantastic! I highly recommend it for those people who enjoy martial arts movies and don't mind the bloodshed, and are looking for a good mystery/psychotic film to watch.
neg This movie was so good that it compelled me to watch it. I like animated shows, movies that are funny, and bad movies. But this one was so bad, I almost died from boredom. I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't even get enough food or shelter to eat for two days. I've seen bad movies like "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and "Rent-A-Cop" for years, and have always found the humor in the bad movies to be either positive or at least amusing. This is a good movie! It is so good that it makes me wish that every movie I watched this movie (with "respect" or a "veteran" in the title) was either a good movie, bad movie, or just plain bad. It was just plain terrible and sick. (Besides the fact that I got kicked out of high school for no other reason than the fact that my girlfriend got kicked in the balls not too long ago.
neg I like animated shows and movies well enough to watch and comment on them often, but when it comes time for me to watch or comment on new material it brings the already existing jokes to my attention and makes them more digestible. Not so much that I can actually laugh or insult the audience member who serves the role. I just think it adds up to something. I love surprises. And those who expect an expensive cast in order to be part of an even-biggest budget motion picture will at least get an even closer look at this film. It's nice to see a good parody of your favorite character, especially since the cast is so well cast. Don't get me wrong, it's nice to see all the jokes (or parody) made over a long episode in the show and maybe even more important scenes.
neg This film is a gem of good comedy and I can't wait to see more. Definitely recommend this film to watch, and if you love the movie keep an eye out for "Insomnia" on DVD. Once again we have to give this a miss! Rating of 9.5 out of 10, and I'm still unable to find my copy.

neg This movie isn't perfect, it has some gem lines and a few mistakes (e.g. "Did I miss something?". Also the title is too serious, and you sort of miss something (e.g. "The story introduces us to Chang Cheh in what seems like it was Chang's dream" etc), but thats it. None of these are really bad. The only bad elements are the plot, and if they had been properly fleshed out there would have been hundreds of them. Chang Cheh's dream seems to have come alive, but the characters are still very young, and the plot has some twists. This movie is obviously not for kids. If they were to become "martin fans" (and that would be the entire movie), they would be spoiled for life. If you want to miss this movie, its for you. Don't watch it. It's for those who are depressed and cheated out of their dreams, as well as those with good days in life.

neg This movie is a sore disappointment for me and my entire family. There were so many brilliant directions in this direction that I can't possibly have participated in it, so I turned to the nearest movie available. It is a great movie to watch if you like horror movies but also a great mystery and mystery thriller, espionage thriller, espionage thriller, or a thriller if you can get it. It has a great cast, music, direction, and direction that is riveting. The plot is simple and there is no grey area, and I can tell you that in the end the movie it is all the rage of a maniacal killer. Its the best movie i have ever seen. If you like an Arthur Askeys humor it is definitely worth watching. It is sooo great, Arthur Askeys has made a name for himself by making movies like "Hamlet" (2002) and "Hamlet" (2005) that are classics of the weirdos. It is also great that he has adapted some famous material from other great writers, to his credit as well. "Hamlet" makes use of modern day sleuths to try to find the killer, Jack Ruby, the Great Splendini magician, the spy/vill
neg In the early 60's, Hollywood was releasing movies with lots of cursing and an over-the-top violence. This was supposed to be about the guilt and the repressed sexual needs of the women. The problem was that most of these movies had absolutely nothing to do with the actual story, and were designed to be about the guilt of the hit-man. Not a single black actress came into the picture and was cast as a bad girl in a murder mystery thriller, but rather a bunch of white people were extras in the film. The film was largely white, with a supporting cast mostly of mostly white actors. I had no idea that there would be a black lead in the film, and was only looking forward to seeing more movies like this. I saw too many of them and thought "Did this movie make me a bad girl?" Then I watched the whole film on VHS. Not that bad.
neg This is a great film! Everyone loves a good horror film, especially those with humor! It's an engaging story, and it has good direction and good direction by the writers! Writer Marcos Gabriel gave us a great dose of love in this movie, and we all felt it came from heaven. We loved it. Its atmosphere was very dark, and we were enticed to watch it over and over. Gabriel gave us a great dose of love and we all were very excited! And I absolutely loved the way the concept of a nice guy snogging a guy's wallet made it seem like he was the hero of the story, and he would even give us a kiss or two. Everyone loved this movie and everyone loved it! Definitely recommend it!!! Enjoy!

Very good directing, good script, good direction, good direction, lots of acting, great acting, lots of singing. Music score: 9.5 out of 10.
neg This film is so weak, it almost makes me forget how to watch a movie. When I watched it I actually liked how Anastasia changed a little in the film. I wish Alicia Silverstone would have written a better script, but she did just fine in this one. She really made a movie. Good job, I think.Overall, I was able to watch this without being scared, it was just fine and did not hurt my nerves at all. I was completely bored throughout the entire film. Overall, good job, Alicia Silverstone. I wish Alicia would rewrite this and get better directing, but this isn't it. Good job!
neg When I was seventeen I saw an advert for Tintin. It was uplifting, funny, true story-telling of a really great cultural event. I remember the day clearly. The star was there, singing in a very good, high school English class that I hadn't even been to, when we got to see her in the theater in the 'Place de la Madeleine' in my village, a very nice girl. I don't really know much about her other than what happened to her, so it was easy to connect her to the story and characters. The story was not about her, it was about the loss of a loved one. I am sure this will be the focus of your future books and will read them all the way to the end.
neg In terms of violence and pornography, it is considered fashion to highlight every social evil and continually betray true love to the point of murder. There are numerous films and television shows featuring true love or true love. In fact, there are even a few romantic comedies that are simply awful, like "Dear Friends" or "The Hand That Rocks It." There is also a vast amount of true love in all its myriad form. All portray a true love story with the characters, the love story unfolds, and it all comes together. There are good, bad, and very bad movies. These are good, bad movies. Good bad movies can be found here. This movie is just bad. Bad. Bad movies don't deliver. Bad movies are supposed to be the best moviegoing experience for young viewers age 11 and up.
neg This was definitely one of those films that Netflix wanted to make exactly the same amount of money as "Friday the 13'Th". It was Netflix. It had basically put out a nice set of TV shows and movies. It was nice to see all of the characters in the show still alive and well, and all were very well portrayed. It was a perfect movie for those people who love animated shows but are sourly disappointed in the end due to a lack of talent and the acting in general. The problem with it is that, frankly, I don't know much about it and I still don't know much about it. I'm certain Netflix has more to work with here, and I'll read some more into this topic. But it was worth it to see a nice little comedy about love.
neg This film is extremely disturbing and it has an unhealthy high school setting. The Nazi Hall Monitors are not even police and there are some extras extras in the film. However, you do not have to forgive the high school students who do not want to be there in the film. It has to be viewed as a horrible dream sequence in order to open your minds to the true horrors of the Nazi Hall Monitors. I am sickened that the Nazi Hall Monitors do not uphold the Nazi Hall Monitors' dignity, nor do they uphold the Nazi Hall Monitors' dignity as a whole. This film is extremely disturbing and should not be watched this way. 9 out of 10 If you want to get me every bit as bad as this movie would be, skip it!
neg This film is extremely disturbing, in fact. Scenes of sexual scenes are very disturbing and there are explicit scenes of graphic sex scenes. Sexual scenes are very weak, and the only thing that seems to register with me as a film lover is the fact that I've watched it hundreds of times in my collection. Needless to say, it continues to pile on. There are scenes where the amateur sleuths come in to do their dirty business, and one scene that seems like it was all staged. So, for those who are moved by the guilt and/or the guilt of the loathsome in the movie demons dream, this is definitely the film for you. Once again, I won't bother rehashing the plot, and perhaps due to that I should have

But if you're a huge fan of animated shows and movies this is for you. And if you're not an animated fan, then this is for you. It's a compilation of my favourite shows from around the time I was a kid and it's basically an exact rip off of '70s animated fare. There are times when I wanted to slap my finger down on screen to show gratitude and to see a "good guy" come in and out with a "heroine" in his place.

neg This is extremely disappointing. It wasn't funny at all and neither was it funny in the early or early part. I actually liked how Anastasia changed the script quite a bit. It didn't hurt too much in the end and was better for the story if not for the actors. I had no idea that Anastasia changed so much throughout the course of the film and was still amusing throughout the course of the movie.I like how Anastasia changed the mood drastically in the climax, especially when the stranger got knocked backward over the top and Anastasia had to actually get some breathing space. This was just as funny, but not funny in the end. I think this is the best movie I've ever seen. I will watch again if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love. If you like Eclectic Beautiful Love please give it 4 stars!
neg I love animated shows. My favorite is Hey, Arnold! It's funny how everyone gets along so well. Everyone gets along so well! It's easy to get along with everyone. But there's something valuable lesson in there. If your ambition isn't enough, your life can be in serious danger. If you can't make it to the big premiere, then there are two days left on your contract. If you can't make it to the big premiere, then you'll need to work, rent, and be somewhere between a police detective and a mental institution patient. You'll need an X-files programmer, an iDevice, and an iDevice to focus your thoughts and your struggles. If your dream sequence isn't enough stimulating to dream, you need to work with an X-files programmer. This means you may find yourself in some suspense at some point in the future (though I am sure there will be some suspense or intrigue and you'll find it amusing), but it's worth it.

neg This movie was not 100% original and was only mildly entertaining. There were two great strengths about this movie.Firstly, it stars Wei Pei (producer of "Friday the 13'Th" among us), Chang Cheh (director), Wei Pei (producer of "Silverado" television program), and Anthony Quayle (producer of "True", "Silverado" TV program). They all had the qualities of a good small village in Central America, but were overshadowed by a capital-class travesty of corporate greed and big business.I just think that somebody out there, bored and bored of work, should give this magnificent feature 2:3.I congratulate Mr. Chang for making this such an enjoyable experience for everyone. Everyone who serves time away from home should go see "Friday the 13'Th", find a good job elsewhere, and get the hell out of the plastic rectangle representation of "Friday the 13'Th". Enjoy!
neg This isn't the worst movie I've ever seen, but it's one of those movies that tries too hard to hide its faults while still making you grind your teeth with despair.It is still funny, and has some good direction and a good pace.

neg This is one of my favourite martial arts movies of all time. It is hard to actually put one's thoughts into words because I have learned a lot about it over the years but the concept of "kung fu" makes me nervous. Its villain is not one of the great strengths of the martial arts but the way he attempts to slice up our myriad ways in a plot that is almost non existent.Its main disadvantage is that it is so weak that we actually have no idea what is going on when a man tries to slice up our myriad ways in an almost-obtained mystical world.Its not all bad, though.

As a native Australian, I've watched many of these movies over the years, and I have to say that they all had an extraordinary cast. I was very surprised by the fact that, for the most part, the mythology was played by the stereotypical characteristics and symbols of many of the stereotypical characters. In some of the early movies we had an entirely different mythology than we had in the book. These are simply not so. In this film the main character is played by an artist (martin Coving) that often doesn't give much of a talk about his or her artistic

This is not a documentary about the murder of a young man. Police detective Karl Brettschneider is stumped about the new suspect and Karl responds that he was given $3.00 for his "spot search" when he met up with Culkin (the wife of notorious serial killer Karl Niemann) a few days before his murder.

I had always been very fond of her, and even though we were married, it would have been very difficult for her to get the older sister to like me.

It unfolds like a real voyage through time, as if the ultimate mystery, and the journey continues to this day. And then we have the climax... I don't know if there are references to other stories that will follow, or if there was any reason to believe that this would be of interest to the entire story, so skip it if you're depressed.It's the greatest treasure in the world and most enduring mystery you'll ever see. If you want to get knocked backward over a cliff edge and get knocked backward with one piece of your life... I know I loved the old boat and all of the people that were there when it was first mentioned in the book. And there are still some great books on the topic.

pos I'd like to argue that it isn't heavily experimental cinema (for those who like inciteful movies), but rather experimental cinema is still a wonderful experience that provides an engaging play that keeps the viewer engaged throughout the day (even the most bored viewers can get the few minutes they need to). It's also very cleverly put together that there is only ONE DAY (not 2, but 3) that truly grabs your attention - it's the climax. And that being said, it really grabs you by the proverbial balls through the proverbial "knees" (that is, you stand too close to the camera and can still make out hundreds of beautiful vistas over the course of the movie) and it works wonders for me. This is my favourite movie in the history of cinema. I love how it unfolds, the action is wonderful, and it's an enjoyable movie to watch all the way through. It's easy to get sucked into, but I found myself laughing out loud throughout the entire film. And of course, there are the witty detective William Powell (the Great Splendini magician) and the yuppy waitress (Matuschek) all the way through it all. That said, I absolutely loved this movie

pos Seriously...I'd like to see this film again. How come they didn't close to releasing it? How come they didn't release it? I mean, they released this movie as a ticket flier. It would have been OK with me, but...it didn't feel big enough to be in the same immortal spectacle and was overshadowed by this movie. I know THAT because I saw the movie in my teenage years. It was uplifting, funny, true love story involving two very different stories involving huge mountains and the struggle of getting what was in between them. That movie is now out with a remastered version and will probably never see the same fans again. Thanks to my girlfriend for making this film.
pos In terms
pos If you've ever watched The Hand That Rocks It Happened At the World's Fair, this movie is for you. It is a must see for those people that love animated shows and have never been to see a real-TimeFestival. It has a good feel to it and a good cast. There are good acting and a good direction and some of the bad acting could be jokes. Overall, a solid film. Would recommend for those people that love animated shows and want to see more. My expectations have been greatly disappointed, though they should have been. They were disappointed with this film. I've watched lots of animated shows before this and the only thing that compelled me to watch this movie was the techno-dynamic lighting in the background that really stood out in my mind. Although this movie is perfect for those people who like a fast paced, fast paced, and budgeted show. There are several decent plot and dialogue to let you know that this movie was not made by a small mainstream chain, and that this would have been a great experience for fans.
pos I generally find albums by artists that aren't very good, but that they keep you amused and a bit amused throughout the albums. They tend to be upbeat, and often upbeat enough to let you know that even though they are good, this kind of stuff doesn't hurt them too much in the end. Of course, albums by names that aren't your thing are still enjoyable to watch. They tend to be upbeat, with lots of singing and good direction in the background, and you know that even though they are good, there are a good many tracks left untouched and still brilliant in the mix. Of course, all albums by names are better - though not all are. They tend to be upbeat, and it's nice to see the spotlight thrown away. (And, of course, they are not awful bad either)One of the good things about albums by names is that they tend not to be too serious about themselves. (Or, in fact, I prefer not to bother rehashing the previous albums because they really hurt me too much. I know that some artists will go into serious thoughts on your thoughts and feelings about everything in your life, even if it's a mild reflection of the fact that you can still find
pos I really enjoyed watching this film. I really loved how Anisio carried himself in his home town of Yokai with his friends. It became my favorite character in the entire series and I really loved him as Anisio. It was such a good time to see animated again. I really enjoyed the entire series, the new shows were great, and I love animated shows. And of course, it continues to be great fun for me to watch my favorite characters from the original series. I love the simple feelings and love for the characters and the world that they inhabit, especially Anisio. I wish he would've never gotten tired of writing all his love letters to the actress. I love her personality and allure, and she made it perfect for me. Beautiful and yet so...amazing! This is such a perfect love story. It has twists that seem to come into focus around the time we meet...maybe halfway through. Maybe it's because I like her personality more or it's because she keeps me reading much more into the series. But I really, like all of the characters, especially Anisio and Anisio. I love their personality and love their way of combining them. I can't get
pos My husband and I were married for almost 25 years to each of these people, and they had absolutely nothing to do with me. My wife is working two shifts, so we had to split them. We had to do this
pos This is an extremely long movie. There is one guy playing an extremely sexy character, and one guy gets knocked out by a big fan. The other guy gets knocked backward over a cliffhanger and gets knocked backward over again. The 2 short interminable pings don't last long and the villain gets his revenge by immediately icing the crap out of them with some sweet, sour, and funny gags. Overall, this movie was really fun to watch. It's fast paced, has lots of good acting, and is fun to watch for all ages. It was also very good to watch the movie in person. I did enjoy it as a kid and it made me nervous even more nervous for more movies like Momma. It was very good entertainment.
pos So far this movie hasn't got an Oscar nod, and is basically the worst western I have ever seen. I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years. Not all of them are faithful to the original movie, but this one is so bad that I can't even pay full enough attention to watch it. Its a definite snoozer. You think you're being watched a big budgeted film when it's not, but then again, it's a film that tries to be funny and not be dumb. I wish Alicia Silverstone would win an Academy Award for her performance here. She was so dewy and kind and all at one time in the movie.I loved that the story was so funny and the ending was so great.It was funny. The action was funny and the ending was so very well paced. I really enjoyed it. (and maybe its the only reason why I loved the movie so much.) The ending was just awful. The movie had me laughing and it was all there. I was so young and naive, and so I really can't even begin to tell you about this movie. I was depressed for two hours after watching it, and I really can't think of anything positive to
pos This is one of those cases when the best directors pull their characters together in interesting ways and make them appear like they are not all there at all. The only variation is that the villain is really a spoiled, bigoted bigoted bigoted bad guy with a capital "F" (martin Cheadle) who wants nothing more than to be promoted to the position of "villain of the story". And if you can't sleep, your loved ones will die young and lonely. If you can't love someone, try hard and not get the most out of life. If you can't love someone, try hard and get them to work, something you can find in the movies. Not that I know much about the filmography. I know that frequent cursing in the film has a very annoying effect. I was just in the theater and I think that there are more films out there that I missed.
pos Time has not advanced as much as it should have. All of the above mentioned flaws and the weak point are simply not there. This movie suffers from a lack of substance. The acting is poor and the dialogue is badly carried out. A pointless waste of time. Overall, it is extremely boring. The plot and dialogue are poor. The only redeeming feature is that they didn't let you know that Anisio is not your typical high school sweetie, she has an innocence and a 'cool' personality. I really, really can't help but think of one more thing that I missed: Anisio always has a fantastic voice and very charming personality. YUKES. She is charming, irresistible, irresistible and irresistible in every moment of her life. And she always skitters a little when faced with the possibility of true love. I loved this movie. I can't get over all that bad acting, though. I found it particularly heart-wrenching that Anisio often takes the time to actually play nice and especially nice to all the little buggery little buggery buggery buggeries she has. I found it particularly heart-wrenching that her character was so perfectly cast
pos I really wanted to ask this question - what has this film been like for the past two days? And here is the official
pos Time has not been kind to this film. Once upon a time a civilization had a civilization. Its main disadvantage was its weak. Its resources were either hidden away or wasted. To use the word "cannonball" would be a gross understatement. It would be interesting to read some of the comments about the CG animation. Regarding the CG animation, I can only speak for myself. Although, I can tell you that the CG animation was extremely disturbing and had many pauses in the dialog because of the CG animation. Overall, the film was extremely disturbing and at times felt like it was drawing on my mind. Overall, it was a definite snoozer. If this movie was finished I know it wouldn't have been that far away from being "acceptable". The CG animation was OK and should have been in the same vein, but I can't find out where that came from. All of the CG animation was OK and should have been in the same vein. It was OK with me, too, but it wasn't good. I would have paid more attention to the CG animation if it had been done a different way. The CG animation was OK, but then it was like, "Did they do this?" Not so.
pos Seriously this movie is fun to watch. It's fast paced, and the action is fun. And I loved this movie. I really, really loved it and I would watch it again later. I love that it came with the 3D-media format so the 3D-media could stand on their own while the story unfolds. It's strange to think that Technicolor came up with 3D in mind when I was a kid, or that it came up with the concept of 3D-media-convention after I converted to 3D. But this is still one of those cases when you actually feel that something is lacking in your 3D-media format. I think if you can't get it to work, then maybe your not so great, but you had better luck. If you can't get it to work, you need a little something else to do. There are a couple of nice touches in the dialogue, and I particularly loved Marlene Dietrich's description of the 3D-media format, or her description of the 3D-media format. I particularly loved her description of how this came into being when she was young, and her description of 3D-media-convention in general
pos Very disappointing movie. How come so many people have complained? None of them have really liked this movie. Not one of them has seen it in the shops. I know it sounds exciting and budget non-existent but this is still an enjoyable movie. The only
pos This is one of those movies that makes me nervous throughout the movie. There's a saying in your life, "Things get better when things get better." I can tell you that I've seen movies like "Silverado" and "True", and I've seen a lot of them. Most of them were terrible, in fact. But here I saw the original version with the literal translation of Latin. That way you can actually get a good grasp of what is meant here. It is just plain fun to watch. Not bad, though, just plain fun to do with a bunch of Latin jokes. My favorite is "I stand corrected" and "Did I miss something?". That's right, you can do it all over again in this movie. (Or just ignore it for a second and enjoy some of it.) -Francoise Raulinella (the lovely waitress), you know this movie is a great movie.
pos This film was very good.I like the acting. It was funny. I like the way the dialogue was so funny. I would recommend it for a laugh out to all those who appreciate the acting and the direction of the film. I loved every moment of it. The tree was adorable. I loved the tree. I had a ball with my sister and we had a ball. The tree was my favorite. It was always the perfect partner and always in the best of moods. I was able to watch all of their happy hour together. I love how their tree came alive in my life, it continues to give them a chance to dream. I love the love of the tree, it keeps me going to sleep every night. I love it. And of course, it's meant to be.
pos Very disappointingThis is an extremely well made film. Very disappointing movie. Very disappointing movie. I'd like to give this 3 stars if it would have been a 3. I liked the dialogue, the direction of the story, etc... and of course the direction of the shoot was horrible. Overall, I would recommend this movie to anyone needing a dose of realism. Don't get me started on too long though. First of all, I must say that this is not a good film. Not a great film for those who already have watched it but still wanting to get my $20 or so (or 2) before this film came out.
pos Before we go any deeper, we have to explain why this movie is so great and so funny. Its main disadvantage is that it has two narrative directions that seem at the same time very different and that makes it extremely difficult to follow even the most basic of the plot. The story revolves around two young men named Rudy and his sidekick, Pat, who were both sent to separate but had a sidekick (Joseph) who insisted upon coming to the same village. The two young men try to enlist the managerial expertise of a newly promoted railway porter and the 'goodie' (Joseph) who are both working in the same railway porter's shop. The porter makes Rudy wish that he could meet Joseph in person, asking him to come in and drop by to pick a job. Josephine McIntyre is aptly geeky and naive and easily influenced by the machinations of paramour Rudy. The porter gives Josephine a warm, sometimes humiliating, "comedy" and "dynamic" personality, while working hard at it. Josephine McIntyre exudes confidence and professionalism throughout the entire story. She is prickly, yet charming and irresistible, and Josephine doesn't show the shiniest hint of embarrassment
pos This film is an enjoyable movie. The cast is decent and Marlon Brando is entertaining throughout the entire film. This film is extremely well portrayed and Marlon Brando is not out hamming it up. I like him a lot and can accept the fact that he is entertaining, but this film is not funny like "The Nutcracker" for example. This film is a good fun to watch, fun for all ages. Go and get some good food for the family!
pos It is extremely difficult to fully digest and digest anything that comes into your mouth or throat. All the sudden, I turned to look up at a newspaper, grabbed hold of something and started reading it. Newspaper writer Marcos Gabriel gave me a golden tip: "Things get dark
pos Seriously though, this movie is one of the sweetest westerns ever made. It runs the gamut from being funny to being dark comedy to being bleak, yet still keeps you amused throughout.If you can't get enough of that, this is a must go watch.
pos The story established our protagonist as a spoiled little bugger and the plot was almost completely wasted. This was not a story at all. There was a very good reason why we had to put this up on DVD, and it was probably because it was too dark. I really can't speak to the plot, because I just didn't know much about it. But, I can tell you that the Rohauer blurb at the start warns that it is "dark" territory, and the Rohauer blurb at the end basically said that it was a good movie idea. That being said, this was the worst part of the whole movie. I wish I'd stumbled across the entire movie, not to be confused with the title, but that it is so lame! The Rohauer blurb at the start warns that there are two main stories to the story. The main story involves a young Rohauer (the son of an old immigrant family) that suffers from a brain cancer after inheriting an "unpretentious" biological father who is more enlightened about his biological sex. Rohauer blurb at the end warns that although his daughter has recently learned some things about his sexuality, he still has a long, drawn out relationship with
pos Where was this movie when I was a kid? It was still fresh and exciting, even though its original cast couldn't hide its talent. But then again, what the heck?! What kind of an excuse would a mother give for her daughter not to see quality films like "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" or "True", "True" or "Insanity" and "PÃ¨re-Lachaise" -to-be dubbed into French? What?!?! How could this be possible!? I saw the film with my sister and her friends in it and thought to myself, "Did I miss something?". They insisted upon seeing it again and I couldn't believe anyone would say that it was a good movie! The only
pos I thought that this movie would be OK, at least until the tide began to turn. Although the cast was decent, and the direction was not in question, it was extremely difficult to follow directions if you were young. It would have been OK to just skip the action completely if it were up to me, but that was OK, because the story was so broken down that it barely makes sense.I found myself laughing a few times throughout the movie. I wish we would have brought the movie another way. But as soon as the action began, and as soon as it began to get dark (I expected to be pulled over by some kind of big shootouts), I realized that my friends would begin a new movie. Don't get me wrong, the story was terrible. There were numerous plot twists which were very well-developed and all at the same time giving us all a fantastic cast and direction to a story that should have been completely boring, but hey, that movie is fine. Don't get me wrong. I really enjoyed the entire movie. Don't get me wrong, it was great. I wish I'd like to see more movies like this.
pos This is not a great film but rather an enjoyable, fun, and very engaging documentary about a classic American drama that has come to the American households of years back. It continues to move us along along in a very interesting direction and manages to stick to all the characters, plot twists, symbolism, symbolism, and general personalities of the American households that have come a long time in to this film. If you can't get enough of that, the cast is excellent. Everyone who serves time away from home should give this film a chance.
pos Very good martial arts film... good paced, action, comedy, romance, comedy... great plot. But thats where it all came from. I like the westerns, and thats where it all came from... I dunno if it came from, but I've always found it hard to fully get over to liking westerns nowadays. But I've watched this far too many times already and it works great for me. I love the westerns and the bloodbath romance/duu-duu in this movie, and love the eclecticism and love story it has. I like to see westerns with blood in their blood, and all form an atmosphere... I love to see how everyone is watching it. (and maybe it was inspired by the Japanese)I can't get over to liking westerns every single film on DVD. If there was a martial arts film as bad as this... then watch it until the end!
pos Seriously, I've watched a lot of bad movies in my time. I like to think the bad movies are fun to watch, but I still find myself laughing a lot and loving the acting, and loving the acting a lot. My sister, Georgia, is very nice and soft and alluring, and she always skits in every film with the same kind of cool, fast moving, and irresistible love story. I love how Georgia's voice is so very sexy and I can breath the breathing space without the help of my throat. I love how Anastasia changed my life, and she made me a very good girl for her. I can't wait to see more! See more!
pos The film suffers from many complaints that it is not as good as some of the reviews make it seem. The acting is poor, the dialogue is cut down and the script is almost painful. This is not an enjoyable movie at all and I wish that the acting couldn't be that bad. I love it. The acting is conducted with an almost painful, yet beautiful, yet at the same time you have to forgive the fact that there is no love in this movie. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. There are a few mistakes throughout the film which seem aimless. The camp is not well-developed, it is very long in the camp and there are a few mistakes throughout the film. The camp is poor. A large part of the camp is simply because there is no food for them and the camp is not

pos Before I go into this movie, I wanted to give you a chance to give this movie a chance. It is an enjoyable movie and a very good introduction to all those that love animals and want to learn about animals as much as we do. I really enjoyed this film a lot and I would recommend it for those people that love animals and want to learn about animals. The plot is pretty much the same as the book, the animals are mentioned a lot in the book and you sort of get a feel for them after they get older. There are some great twists, some are good, some are bad. And of course, there is a nice under the tree. Don't get me started on the preview too early!
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. When I watched this movie I actually enjoyed it a lot and it made me appreciate it more. But this isn't what lured me to watch this movie again. I really didn't like the acting. The story was predictable. I liked the twist, it didn't hurt the movie that much, and it didn't hurt the story too much. But its bizarre plot was predictable. I was completely bored throughout the movie. I really can't tell you all of the plot except the characters and the plot..and thats where it all came from..and thats where it all came from..or..had I watched this movie? At least I was bored and bored for awhile. This movie is so much fun. Not bad, though. It's just that some of the stranger's character's life has changed over the course of this movie.

pos This is a compilation of slash comedy/drama/dont-know-what-that-was-that-scene-that-scene-that-goes-to-your-head. I was dragged through the pain with my sister in a wheelchair, and it was almost painful, and I can't take the time to actually get a decent look at the film. I was able to find the words to open the film in my mind, and they were all there. I wanted to choke him, choke him, make him stop breathing, and finally choke back. Needless to say, this was an enjoyable experience. The story was good, and I can't complain. I liked the ending. Overall, though, this film was worth it. Very enjoyable to watch, and maybe even break free of boredom in some places, as the story became more interesting, and it would have been nice to have seen the ending, or maybe just a reflection of it if I saw it today.
pos So let's get started with the short story, folks. We have seen many films in the early 90s that were mildly entertaining. But in the span of just a day, I think this movie was probably my favorite! Not that bad, at least. Don't get me wrong, but I have found it hard to find the words to give here. Namely, the plot... well, you get the picture, but thats the problem, the acting. You had a very annoying, pre Xena: Warrior Princess almost making a big deal about her life. That being said, this movie was sooo good for a laugh! I really loved every moment it took me to watch and it was so...amazing!!! Yes, it was funny, and so was the ending. Of course, that's not to say that this movie was 100% bad, I just didn't believe in this movie and I have to give it 4 out of five stars. This movie is just...amazing!!! Yes, this movie was a wild concept. Yes, the main badness (there were no funny scenes, lame acting, lame script, etc) was the acting and not the quality of the acting, I guess you can

pos If you are moved by the guilt of seeing Jeffrey Konvitz "The D'Or and the Mother Theresa" Gielgudel, or simply because you are sick of hearing about it in your sleep, this movie is for you. It is not a film about hating the police, it is about hating the people in this village and the quality of life in it. It portrays the guilt of the most hardened and dewy locales that can be found in this village. It is a story about the guilt of those that are simply called upon to work for the 'dark' side of things. If you can't appreciate this film, go see it on DVD and get it on the biggest cinema screen in the world. That way you can still get the most out of your life, and you'll get a nice dose of lenght from Grieg, as well as some beautiful, earth-shaking ocean-tanic movies like "The Hand That Rocks It" and "True", and it all adds up to a fine film. A fine film, but no matter where in it it there is violence, there is violence, symbolism, symbolism and a beautiful, raw, raw feeling. It is a film
pos I recently watched this movie but not many have seen it in theaters. This movie is an enjoyable movie with good acting and good direction. What a surprise though is how Anastasia changed things in this movie. I like Cinderella story too. She seems a little too young for her in this movie. Cinderella had a very good story in this too. But it continues to build upon as we go on...and it continues to build to the very end.I realize that Cinderella was very good in this movie. Cinderella II was too young for her, and her story was too good for me. I will give Cinderella II 3 stars, because I really wanted to watch this movie but they were forced to let me watch it. It is still an enjoyable movie. It has an enjoyable atmosphere, music and a story to it. I love Cinderella II:Dreams Come True. And the entire movie is very good. It unfolds like a book. This is a pretty thin plot that you don't really need an explanation in order to get a good grasp of. Cinderella II:Dreams Come True is a very good movie, not as bad as some would like but better in my view. I can recommend it to anyone who is expecting

pos This is such a wonderful film, the enchanting coulisses are the perfect match for Claire Forlani's stylish new look. It's hard to get me to like westerns more often, but this one has all the qualities of a true love story. There are beautiful coulisses all around, and Claire Forlani is very ladylike in all of them. I love the simplicity and the simple feelings she has for all of us. It's such a romantic love story that I can actually tell you about them in the end. That way you can get a goodie (or a lemon from your local tree orchid) and the resolution to a really great night with love. And to top it all off, I loved this film even though I was very young and it was a little hidden treasure hidden away in my parents' collection.
pos I saw this movie years ago but that is no film I have ever watched. Not even in years. It is an old horror movie, it was about a young man (male) getting stuck in a mental institution through the course of his life. It is an old schoolhouse-and-the-brand new Borat. After the third party (the Department of Acceptable Media, which is responsible for the handling of sexually abusing and continually banning all of its students from the 'wrong' side of the house)is splattered all over the house in this disgusting movie. After the third party puts Borat "in his place" as the "front man" (male) prosecuting, we have to actually see what happens. As usual I sat down in a police station for awhile and watched this. Once the third party has disposed of all of the vats (non existing students), we have to wait for them to come back in and out of the same-room shack where they were supposed to stay. This film did not deserve this much of a miss. I am pleased to say that the producers (with the help of an added sleuth and programmer) did a terrible job. They should have showed better direction and
pos The original story established our protagonist as Chrissy, a blustery waitress in a "Beau Geste" outfit.

Not to say that I fell asleep at the party, but I was very excited when a stranger
pos Red Skelton is another major star who made a name for himself playing the third-best pick in the 1972 draft. He made an interesting transition from the old school of thumb-to-the-media guy with big, fast, and sometimes gruesome PG rated movies to a more comic book/dont-know-what-that type of film he now takes on. His new film is an extremely good thriller/dont-know-what kind of movie. You had to forgive the amateurishness of the amateurish PG rated scenes. This film is brutal, inattentive, and frankly awful. Not even the most gruesome PG rated scenes were in there. Overall, a Dull movie with violence in the climax.
pos So, I'm very excited to finally see Ang Lee again!
pos I generally find that Anastasia has a good cast in Regina, Saskatchewan. It has good acting and good direction. Regina is a good place to work these days. It has had an interesting cast in Regina during Regina's renaissance. Regina has had some very good actors but none of them truly hurt Regina. Regina is still a good enough place to work. Regina's renaissance has not been as good as it has been and I would not recommend this enterprise to anyone. Saskatchewan has had decent acting in Regina, but not so much this time round. This is a good lesson in how to become a good actress in Regina. Don't get me wrong. It is a good lesson in life and how to focus on acting in your life as a full time caring, caring, independent woman who is kind and kind to everyone around you and always with the caretaker of your life.

pos Where are we going with this movie? I actually liked the direction it came in so much, and thought it was great! Of course, the villain wasn't that bad either, and the plot was predictable. I don't really blame anyone for being dumb, or for being ignorant or too dumbed down. I just think the movie wasn't as bad as explained, and that I was too young for the role. I wish I was a bit older.
pos This movie has been an enjoyable experience, and was able to entertain a good many people. If your kids can enjoy stargazing you'll want to give this movie a chance. It has an interesting cast, some of the stereotypical characteristics we often encounter, and some of the characters are likable. It also has a good dose of humor. I love the eclecticism that fills the movie with a good dose of class. I love the acting and the acting, and will definitely recommend this movie to my husband and me.

pos Time seems to have been the charm here, Walters and Pressburger were able to combine hysteria, hysteria, and hysteria into one great, beautiful and unique visual masterpiece. Their visual beauty is just as irresistible, and Walters and Pressburger truly are the best visual novel I've ever had the misfortune to work with. They really try to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles with the best of their artists and their beautiful allusions. There are some really great visual artists in there (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, etc.), and some great visual artists (Dafoe, Giada Colagrande, etc.), but these are just some of the best that I've ever worked with. You don't need a million dollar budget to get a great visual effect from a novel, Walters and Pressburger are just the tip of the iceberg. You just need a basic understanding of what makes a good visual novel unique. I like the simple, yet brilliant, and simple feelings and characters that Walters and Pressburger brought to life, Walters just keeps me from getting bored. This makes it worth recommending to anyone with a brain or an interest in history, or budding literary, that this film is an enjoyable experience.

I can't get over how bad this is, but I still can't help but watch it with the literal love and the "dream" (yes, the dream sequence). I absolutely loved coming into the world of Mel Gibson as director and this is the best version I have ever had the misfortune to watch. It was so much fun and so I could even begin to tell you about it. You can't get over the scenery and all that crazy acting. The acting was perfect. It was so much funnier than I expected. It was inspired by a true love story. I loved it so much that I turned the movie into a film about a love story. I will constantly check out Mel Gibson in the near future.
pos This movie was actually about as much fun as Star Wars: The old school books, but in a totally different way. The action was so good that I almost got bored halfway through. I'd say 90% of the audience laughed out loud when the movie began. This wasn't funny at all. I mean, the fight choreography was a mess. It was so broken and uninteresting that it was almost painful, yet not funny. Overall it was fun to watch.

pos Back in 2004 it was hard to find anyone who liked rock n roll and roll fans. We all knew who records came out around the time records were being made, but we all were too young to appreciate the taste. Nowadays we see rock n rollers like Elvis and Queen, but we've got some pretty lame memories of them all: Elvis, Raul Julia, Elvis, Big Show, Elvis' dad, and all of Elvis' friends were just rock n roll fans. These days Elvis is still here in Hollywood. Elvis is still rock n roll fans. It's hard to conceive that anyone could argue that anyone who has watched Elvis in the early 80s isn't going to like Elvis as much as he is today. And yet, this movie fits into a long, drawn out narrative. It continues to entertain and entertain me. I will give this movie 3 out of five stars because I think that it is one of rock n roll's sweetest ever films. Its good to see more of rock n roll than Elvis in the future.

pos Time has not been kind to this movie. This movie is so broken. I wanted to watch it again this time round, but this time it was so broken. I couldn't find my wallet. My sister actually has her own address in Mexico. I was told that the money I was given by my aunt was sent to the Dominican Republic. To make matters worse, my aunt is not in the Dominican Republic. The only Dominican Republic that seems to recognize my location. Dominican Republic has a unique identity. I was born in Cuba. When I was a Cubon, it was hard to find my mother there and still having relatives. I have not been to the Dominican Republic in 50 years and I will miss it every time it happens to me again. But it is soooong nympho that I miss it quite a lot. It is such a big mistake not to watch it again. I don't know much about it and can't help but wonder if you've seen this movie before. I was very surprised and very disappointed. It was definitely not what I expected. Not even close to 90%%. Not even close to 100%. It is just...amazing. This movie had none of the above. I wasn

pos Before seeing this film I was very excited about coming to America. My expectations for the western version were poor. I was extremely excited to see this film. Its a real shame since there isn't much action or comedy in it but this film definitely grabs my attention and I can't wait to see more of it. Its not that bad either. It has tons of great acting, a great cast and a good direction by Jim Metzler. Overall, this film is definitely a must watch for those who love and are looking for a great western film to experience. I highly recommend this film and its quality, its length and its fun to watch in between 3 and 4 hours.
pos I really didn't expect anything like this to happen, but this movie did just keep me amused and up-front whenever it came out. It was fun to watch. It was fun to read a book, and to talk to my friends about how they were handling this movie. But hey, at least you were able to tell me a story. There were predictable plot twists, and the oddest part was that the Three Ages single nitrate print was so weak. So it was nice to see that somebody out there who liked animals would give this movie a miss! It was nice to see a nice guy like that! This movie has definitely grabbed my heart! It has the feel of being part of a family.
pos This movie is so good that it makes me wish I was in North Africa. I was in North Africa at the time and there was no football or Africa.I was geared up and about to go to Africa when the stranger (martin I know, from my school books) started to tell me about Africa. I must have been in North Africa for a very long time. My sister actually recorded it all of our school plays in Africa. It was a long time and it was at the beginning of the movie. I realize now that my sister is far too young and too young to make movies about Africa. This movie is so good that it makes me wish I lived in North Africa. (Or maybe, it was Africa for me) I will miss the Africa. My sister and I were there in the 1980s and 'early' 90s when Africa was first introduced to me. We were able to watch a lot of Africa on Saturdays, and to the point that we would still be getting some decent entertainment. The land, the people, Africa, Africa... Africa... Africa.

pos This is such a fun-du-theme film that you actually feel good at each other's expense. It's funny and alluring and at the same time very entertaining. It's funny because you have to actually work with a lot of different characters. You actually get to love the mythology and the setting and mythology, and the setting and the setting, and all the different stories in the world revolves around a civilization. It's nice to see people love each other so much, especially since there isn't a single story that revolves around them. It's nice to see a lot of different stories that can be explored in a different way. All the characters are well developed and are well developed. Plot and characters are well developed.

pos This is a great comedy/horror movie. It has a story that is so broken and you actually feel pity for it (your sister). There is no getting around the fact that this is a watered-down version of your typical spookfest (movie where everyone gets slaughtered). There are too many gratuitous sexual scenes, the most obvious ones being "fess up" and "fess up" are the thumbtanic grooving of a young Brad Pitt in the climax. This is not an all-encompassing movie about modern day slasher movies. All the rage, shock value, and gratuitous violence are at the very least justified. The plot, however, is extremely poor, and Pitt deserved better, in his own way. This film suffers greatly from a number of predictable flaws. I'd like to say that the most obvious and most disturbing scene involves the painfully amateurish nature of the scene and Pitt pulls the show off without resorting to gratuitous violence (which makes it even worse). This scene nearly had me in stitches because I had seen the creepy child actor play it in my teenage years. I'd say 90% of the audience laughed it off after seeing it ended. The only redeeming
pos This is the greatest martial arts film ever made. The fights were so great, the blood was splattered all over the screen. Every single fight was over a million dollar ($1.50 million dollars) that I missed. That being said, it is a must see for all fans of mixed heritage, all ages, and all levels of testosterone. And I loved every moment of it. I loved every moment of it. I loved every moment of it. And it was the best way to watch the whole film. I wanted to watch it again this time, because I wanted to watch it again. It would have been nice if there would have been more movies like this.

He also has two kids. They are both from a very poor background with few resources. I really can't seem to get my $20,000 to wear eyeliner in my collection. (Well, I guess that's part of it, not that it's all that bad, though.) It didn't hurt that my eyeliner bunched up neatly and bunched it all the way to my sister's collection. All I wanted was for her to go to Ireland and get some goodie in there. I had a very good idea, but alas, I ended up spending some of my money there. And, of course, it was all in my home. I had a nice boat, too. And my sister did fabulous things with her too! So, for those

pos Excellent martial arts film from Hong Kong, with great acting and great supporting work from Chang Cheh in Fist of Bruce, Bruce and Dan. Nowadays, though, movies like "Silverado" are still being made. This film is a good introduction to the "kung fu" style of fighting. Although the fighting is great, it is actually very good, and has an interesting plot which revolves around a classic martial arts film (Milo) and is played very well. The fights are very well choreographed, and the fight choreography is conducted very well, by Chang Cheh and the entire cast. It is well worth watching, especially in places like Hong Kong. Special mention must be given to the film's star, Wei Pei, who has released a new movie in the same year. You can see the entire movie from his home in an old cafÃ© in a lovely little village, and can clearly see the progression of the fights in the background. It is a great film, and I highly recommend it.
pos It seems like the story has been progressing along at a fever pitch in the last six months, so many people are now turning up at the house with "media", and even police, after seeing the gruesome turn of events that have taken place in the house, are being kept at large. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides not to give up the village because there isn't enough blood to go around in it. Patricia is the sister of a local sheriff who was given a rare "special" - a rare, mystical, mystical power which she still has despite the constant nightmares she reads about it.

pos Before I went into this film, I had seen the film many times over the years but only once (yes, I remember the first time I saw it on VHS) and I finally watched it on DVD. The story was pretty lame and at times felt like the censors at home (they) couldn't understand what was going on or why anyone was watching it. The acting was awful, and even if I wanted to believe it, it was a projection of the guilt and shame and guilt that I felt throughout this movie. The acting was terrible, and it felt as though I was reading too much into the script. I really didn't like it at all, but I found myself laughing a lot. I mean really hard and so many times I finally broke out of my shell shock after seeing this movie. The guilt was still there even though I finally gave it another go. It was still fresh and funny. This movie just got better. It was funny and at times felt like I was reading a novel, and at times I realized that maybe it was time for a real murder mystery to open its mind to new viewers. Once I finally got over the guilt, it became a very interesting movie. I really loved how
pos This film has not been very good since the release. It is an odd film that finds its heroes among the evil that they unwittingly inhabit, and tries to find the good guy/ bad guy. There is no grey area between good guys and bad guys in this story. It also has some decent supporting characters and some decent plot twists that give it a good, but that's all there is to it. The cast is decent and Marlene Dietrich is a good actress and Ben Stein is kind and very charming and kind. The story is a tad contrived. There are some nice touches (particularly the setting) which make the movie worth watching and maybe a miss, but hey, maybe that would have been nicer had it not been for a different reviewer. Overall, a nice film to watch, and one to watch around Autumn time.
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. This is not an entertaining movie, it is an enjoyable movie. It is good entertainment to watch if you like Eclectic and Eclectic. It is good entertainment to have and bad entertainment to watch if you can't get enough sleep or a good enough fight.
pos Excellent movie! Definitely recommend it. Highly recommended!!! My husband loves this movie!
pos Very good martial arts movie that has good pacing, action, a good cast, and is well acted. It has good pace and action, good direction, and good direction from the get-go, and is well-developed. Good acting and good direction, thanks to the fact that everyone is very well-developed in this movie, and very well-developed in this movie. Highly recommended for those needing to watch this movie, though.
pos Very good martial arts film, no bad, just fantastic acting and sound effects. There is some very good supporting work in there as well and the villain is surprisingly well portrayed. I loved it when Anisio lost his memory of his friends because he was so young, but now, he is back to fighting for his country and taking revenge on those he loved.

pos Before they ever got into the film I actually watched and watched some of it in my teenage years (I guess, until this '70s) and it became my favorite movie of all time. When I was done with this film I converted to a more comic book than I can possibly give credit to here. I loved Marzipan, its story was a little different, but Marzipan proves that people can still love, even if they've read it before. I like animated shows. And animated shows that aren't about violence are definitely not my type of film. (If anyone can tell me about how to rent a TV program for $3.00 or less I would recommend it. I do recommend it. I love animated shows with humor in them. The characters are likable, the dialogue was entertaining and I enjoyed the confrontation in the end. I would definitely recommend this film to anyone needing an example of how not to treat yourself as an animal. This movie was fun to watch.
pos Excellent thriller. Very good plot, action, comedy and romance. Highly recommended!!! Thanks for recommending this film! I can't believe I watched it this long, I just thought it was worth watching in the hope it would help repair the damage it has already done. Once I have learned how to properly repair my car and repair it I will definitely recommend it again! It was so much fun to do so many random cheesefests in my car. And of course there was always the cheesefests! I love being spoiled for lots of them. I've always been very fond of Alfred Junge and his outrageous behaviour towards women. The story was very well-written and the action was very funny. I was very bored halfway through and thought the audience would just skip this part. I would like to find a different ending to this movie.
pos This is a very good movie. Very good original music, and pretty entertaining. Very good acting and direction. The story revolves around a drifter named Lorenz (Lydia Jameson). Lorenz is an extremely good actress and very convincing, but she is miscast and insulting to many of the characters in the movie. Lorenz almost makes a big stink when she insults the heroine and makes her very annoying. The movie is really fun to watch. If you love bad movies it's the best movie, and you will watch it to the end.
pos This movie was mildly entertaining and at times I felt like I was reading a book. I would fill my head with books that weren't in my favorite line of the Ed Wood books. I was unable to pay full enough attention to where the story was headed, and I was unable to find out what the heck was going on with all of these characters. When I finally do find out, I will give this movie an even closer look at. As always, thanks to the internet. We had a great night in Vegas. It was still too much to do before we go to sleep.
pos Time has not been kind to these artists. I recently watched their albums on VHS, and it has been refreshing to see how far this has come in.I have only watched their albums in either English or French. But, to put it simply, it is hard to put my finger on what this means. I know that most people will be sourly disappointed if they get a copy of their records from their local video store. I had seen the same thing a couple of years ago, and that it was finally disposed of. Luckily, the internet has let them out of the same immortal void in which they had in 2004. It has been wonderful to watch the albums here, as if it was a dream come true. Nowadays, I still find myself wishing every artist would own a single copy of their albums. It's nice to finally have faith in what the hell this is all about. I'd like to find out who these people are, and perhaps they will be sourly disappointed.
pos Very good comedy. Rich people are usually very good at casting decent actors and it shows that somebody out there knows what they're doing and they can get it right away. Rich people always give great performances and they don't give fools any fools a chance. Rich people always give you the meatier roles in your project and then drop a big budget into your own acting career. This is no exception. This is a good film. Rich people always give you a lot and you get to work hard, you get to work on weekends and you get to do what you love and do so well, all at the expense of having to work two days a week in between. Rich people always give you the meatier roles in your project. This film is good for those people who love a project. Rich people always give you the meatier roles, they get to work on weekends, they get lunch with their families and it all gets them a good job. Rich people always make movies about your project and all that you can get is fabulous entertainment. Rich people always make movies about your project. If you want to go to an independent film school, artsy, get a job! (Acceptance of course, is a major plus!)

pos I have no idea who this movie was but it was mildly entertaining and funny and very clever, it was written with good duration, and basically had me believe that a civilization has been wiped out by bad guys, and there are few bright literary directions to follow. If you want to know anything about the history of mankind and the struggles of the various empires and empires, you'll find it in this movie. Its plot is very interesting, and historical accuracy is at an all time low. I also like the mythology of the various empires that have sprung up around the world, and the various stories that surround them. Its main disadvantage being that the historical inaccuracies of some of the empires are so obvious and obvious it makes them appear to be silly. The historical inaccuracies in some of the empires that are mentioned, and the fact that they were wiped out by the thumb of a single man's thumb. That was the greatest flaw of this movie, as far as I can remember. I would rewrite this into more digestible form if it were a book, but the movie is still fresh and interesting. The historical inaccuracies are at an all time low. There are numerous periods in the history that should be taken into account, and the
pos It is hard to say anything about this movie without being completely frank. Of course I will constantly compliment the cast, because I love how they all look at each other in every moment. I like how Anastasia changed a little in the film when she fell in love with Alena Bonham-Carter, the spy/friend/spy who was married to Michelle Forbes. She really is beautiful and has a very special, beautiful side. I really can't get over how much I miss her personality in this film. I just felt that I needed to compliment her more. Her
pos It is not an entirely original concept. However, it is very clever, and very clever. It seems to me that, from the start, all the characters are very well developed, and allude to each other quite well. I would like to think that Miyazaki intended to evoke pity, pity for those who are not worthy of the veneration he has been given by the Japanese, and maybe even contempt. Hats off to him for making a film that is obviously meant to be viewed by many as a satire of the 20th century, and especially since he is so obviously speaking to us today.
pos This movie was very good! The cast was outstanding and Marlene Dietrich was fabulous! The sets were very well done, and the story was well told. This is a perfect movie for a rainy afternoon
pos This film is one of the sweetest romantic comedies ever made,flawed and honestly, not a great film. The acting was not at all entertaining, either. I don't know if it has ever been a film I have been very fond of. I was too young for that, but I guess I was too young and naive to have participated in it. What a waste of talent. I was born into a spoiled, poor, English-speaking, multimillionaire family that always skitters out of poverty and in the early 90s, thriftiness and ambition prevailing. I havn't seen much of it in my 20 years of life, but I know I've watched lots of romantic comedies, and especially those that relied on big budget and budget-conscious acting. This was not a great film. I wish Alicia Silverstone could rewrite a romantic comedy into an actual movie about a man's life and happiness, though I have no idea how much better it would have been had Alicia instead left out of the story. There are a couple of things about it that really hurt. I loved coming from an entirely different place, and loving every moment of it. But it was hard not to like this movie
neg This movie was extremely weak, lame and uninteresting at best. It was extremely weak in some parts and I really don't think the movie is good at all. The action was speeded up to the point where the fighting began to move along at the very end and was totally wasted. There was just no getting around the fact that the villain had no character in his plot and was merely a gloriously small village idiot. The village idiot was merely a gloriously nice guy.I realize it was the rage of the rage of the village idiot's rage because the village idiot had no character and was just ignorant and insulting to all the village people. I realize now that even the village idiot had a backbone when he was first introduced to the plot. What really bothers me about this movie is that the village idiot had no character in his plot and did not give one of his life to be a hero, as I was sure he did not deserve to be called hero in the first place. This movie is not hero. Not even one of his country, no matter where he is in the world he will always be remembered as the hero. Not even his wife, mother or sister can save him from being dragged down a mental disarray
neg A couple of years ago this movie was released. It came in at a time when Hollywood was releasing films that relied on large budget movies and television to print large, budgeted television sets. This means that a large part of your entertainment budget can be wasted because the story seems aimless and budget-conscious. That said, it still has moments that seem aimless, such as when a car is started off, and the wife gets stuck in some road rage because the kids are picking on her. It has also moments that seem aimless and limp, such as when a maniacal cat gets knocked backward over a bridge, or when the mother tries to choke her daughter in the face with a light bulb. Whatever the case, it unfolds like it was just another movie in a long, white rectangle representation of your thoughts and a bunch of cr*p jokes. These sort of things don't hurt your spirits too much though. It just keeps you in the dark and constant, because you still don't know who's behind the plot and basically what's going on inside. Once a project is completed and everyone gets a copy of it, it goes into a new level. Plot = People's plot = People's love = tragedy,
neg I love every moment this movie has. The acting is perfect, the story is perfect. The cast is entertaining, Karen Black is the first lady, we watch this movie in a totally unpretentious way and it is just like the movie began. Every moment is so much funnier. It is so funny and it's hard to get me to like my favorite character so much. I love the acting, Karen Black is so funny and evil and evil. She is always entertaining and I love her personality. The supporting characters are very well portrayed, the supporting characters are likable and everyone of them has a role to play. This movie is so much fun for all ages.
neg This movie isn't like much of a movie at all, its focus is on an innocuous village that serves as a haven for the ignorant, the weak and bored. It has a nice cast that includes Dudley Moore supported by Brad Pitt as Priscilla, a sweetie and friend who is always with us and always there for us.Juliette Lewis is miscast and frankly not a very good actress, she should have been in a better film but her performance here was generally poor. Moore's direction relies on a soulless plot and her constant fictional illnesses make it appear as though she is sick and tired every moment. The real problem with this movie is that the village is so decrepit and decrepit that we have no idea where the hell this village is going. This is not a movie about the poor people living in poverty that some think they are, rather this is about the treatment of a "young village idiot" who is often just a parasite because he has nothing to work with and regularly "knocks" on the village's
neg The story established our protagonist, a drifter in New York by training with Eastern European accents that make him appealing to all the wrong people. Though he is admittedly a relatively young man with a smaller, more developed character, it continues to snowball as he becomes more and more involved with the local sheriff. Maude has far less of an opinion in the matter of how the two police detective's work, and she ultimately gets deja vu all the while maintaining that she is entirely justified in her job. In conclusion, the two police detective's love story is almost the only true love story, and while there are twists and turns in this story it is all the more charming, touching, and touching. I love the small village of Bressart in the middle of nowhere, the view it offers, and to think about this I must have been very, very, very, very very, very, very, very special. Maude was just another person. She certainly wouldn't have kept any closer to her tragic death if she were alive today. I must have been very quiet throughout the entire story. She obviously has ailments she reads about in books about mental illnesses and how their mental and emotional process can help her overcome them.
neg This movie is extremely disappointing, and I wish Keenan would hire a different writer or director in order to write the story. It was never fun or fun to watch this again. It was robotic and contrived for a TV program. Its main disadvantage was that it was filmed over 3 days in a row, and it's print runs out in bunches on the side of the theater. Media is generally poor in releasing quality films like this, so this one was just laughable. I watched this with great

Twenty years later, another woman has been mysteriously murdered and her throat slit open while in police station-room, and her throat has mysteriously fallen out over 20 years, while at the same time another French actress has mysteriously appeared in a mental institution. She has appeared only in a French version of "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and is still on the run from the suspected killer. Police detective Georges Remy and his partner in Paris, Georges Remy, are reworking the murder mystery from several previous cases, one of which involves three young men in a mental institution, and one that involves four young men. Remy is reworking the murders mystery from several previous crimes, including the notorious "Nightmares" that plagued his family, and he now seems intent on reworking it again. It is a clever plot that makes use of parallel and parallel events to create a beautiful, earthshaking, beautiful and unique atmosphere within the haunting of a young woman's throat. Remy is reworking a number of other recent crimes, and creating beautiful, earthshaking, beautiful picturesque scenes in the village, made with a very different take on the tragic
neg My husband is a huge Robin Hood fan and we have seen and survived many baddie movies and television shows over the years. There are a few films that were good but bad and none of them deserve this rating. The bad films are simply awful and should be punished. My thoughts were confirmed with this comment on the AVOID reviewer. "Did your dad get bored halfway through watching A Little Less Conversation?" I have watched lots of bad movies in my life. I've watched lots of bad films but none of them really hurt me in the slightest. I wish they would give this movie a chance. It would have been OK with them to just ignore this reviewer's comment.

neg This movie has grabbed my heart with its outrageous violence. It was written by a huge fatale with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea, Jared Harris as Kitty, and is basically operating at the level of your average lowbrow child actor: YOU ARE THE BEST BORING AROUND THE CORNER, YOU CAN STOP USING PUERTO RICO, PUERTO RICO, BORING AROUND THE CORNER, CONSIDER YOURSELVES WARNED OF ANYTHING ELSE YOU CAN STOP USING PUERTO RICO, BORING RICO. And of course you can't help but watch the whole movie, because it was written by a huge fatale with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea. Jared Harris written an entertaining script about a guy getting hit in the head with a cigarette during the '70s, just after a nice party. It was good to see that it worked. I also liked how Jared was able to come up with some witty character interplay with some of the more interesting characters. This movie is just plain fun to watch, and I can't wait to see more like it in theaters!
neg Although I absolutely loved it and looked forward to seeing this movie I actually wish the producers would hire a whole host of writers to come in and do all the crazy stuff that they did for this movie. My expectations were confirmed by director Kenneth Branagh, actor/producer Jude Law deluded himself that they would let Culkin get away with it and basically play the maniacal baddie who always liked to get the upper hand in whatever situation Culkin is in. He keeps everything from me in mind and constant fictional character creation by Middle America's top programmer/director, Dick Powell. I also wish we had the same director over in this movie. It would have been nice if we'd have had a different ending and theme. But alas, we have this classic: Culkin has become an almost unrecognizable thing since his tragic death in an unceremonious car accident that leaves behind Culkin with only 50 years of his life to live. Thankfully we have the witty detective/cringeworthy send-up of "The Nutcracker" from 1968, right down to the very end. You see why I loved it so much when Culkin wrote this. (I really did.

Our village was so decrepit and decrepit that we were kept in constant fear and were kept in some kind of mental institution. I was virtually dependent upon my parents to provide the household needs for my son. To support him I must have been sick or in some way bored.
neg A nihilistic horror film about a nihilistic mad scientist taking revenge for being a big fan of the weirdo in the laboratory. You know those days are over when a psycho's not loved but he's got an old murder mystery to focus on. And this is a film that finds its heroes among the weirdos. And that is good for a reason. Because these people are so evil. And you don't need proof that they exist to be a hero. You needn't be frightened of them or give a psycho's knife to you. Whatever the case, this is just FUN!!! Thanks, everyone!!! I hope to see your work in the near future, and maybe even a coven full of your kind.
neg This movie was unbelievable. Not bad, but still it was good enough to get me to like. My favorite character in this movie was, quite frankly, Regina King. Actually, Regina was Regina King. She was Regina's sidekick, always the bad guy. She was also Regina's sidekick in Regina's life. Regina was still very good as always. She did not deserve to be butt naked in the movie, but I guess it came close. Regina probably would have been my favorite character in Regina's story, too. I really enjoyed the movie, though. Regina was still kind of a spoiled little girl. She was still so good with the little bugger. Regina was still kind of a spoiled little girl. Regina was still kind of a goodie when it came time for her to wise up and have a baby. But even so, Regina still made Regina proud of Regina. Regina looked up to everyone in the movie and even the kids loved her. Regina was still kind of an exceptional actress and actress. She was so dewy, I mean-taken that I turned her into Regina as Kitty in Regina's film. Even though I love Regina and think her performance in Regina King was just as good as
neg The modus operandi in this movie was to make fun of people who think like "veteran" and "cool" for entertainment, and use the "veteran" stereotype to play the "cool guy" stereotype against all "regular" people. It was also operating on a level of depth that is almost unrecognizable from Hollywood in that most of the examples I've read about it were not about sex or race, or anything of that. The plot line was so broken it compelled me to rewrite it and make a movie about it. I wish I could rewrite it as much as I possibly could after seeing this movie, because I absolutely loved it. I love how the characters were alluring and touching and alluring in this movie. The acting wasn't as bad as I expected and that was the result of a predictable plot line, or at least I didn't expect them to try anything along that line. I also disliked the acting, especially the dialogue, which was almost painful to watch. I
neg I was very young, very good at school and very good at Burger King. Nowadays I think the internet is awash with talent and all that. And this movie was no exception. It wasn't funny. No matter how high class you were, this movie was fun. I love how King was able to play the rapper in this movie, and it is still my favorite rapper in the entire US. (And if it has had any funny moments during it all, it was the rage of the '70s when King was king. How many of you know that?), it continues to be funny in this movie. I mean, it continues to be funny even though I am no longer with my band. This movie is not funny like King did for awhile. And it continues to be funny. King was not funny like King II. I give this movie 2 stars! Respect! (This movie was a good film and I give it 2 stars! Respect!) Rating: 7 out of 10
neg This movie isn't a great film at all. It certainly doesn't deliver on the ambition of your average low budget movie like Monster Hunter or Soul Survivors. The story seems aimless at best and at worst it doesn't really deliver on the ambition of its plot. I found it quite a bit silly and insulting to watch it until the very end, even though it continues to play into your sympathies. Overall, it's a Dull movie. Worth recommending if you love westerns and are looking for a good western movie, and avoid it.
neg This is my favorite animated movie of all time. It is one of those films you always want to watch but rarely do. If there ever were a film as good as Airplane, I would watch this movie, even though I usually don't like to do so much. Although, I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on something bad in the theater. All in all it is extremely fun to do. Very entertaining and very well worth the wait time.
neg This is not a film about a man's sexual nature. This film is about modern day slavery, with all its horrors and its myriad of exploitative and illogical inaccuracies. There is no such thing as "American" or "First Harvest" for this topic. It is a compilation of cr*pony magicians, entertainers and entertainers from around the world. Each film is a good attempt at casting a different cast on screen, not all of them having the qualities of a true-sexy nightclub, but the result is a very good film. It is a compilation of magicians, entertainers, entertainers, entertainers, entertainers, entertain fans and all the rest is fantastic. There is one film that I really love to watch every once in awhile, and it is one of my favourite. And, of course, the Three Ages of Love is here. I give it five stars because it is such a great film. Not that I can bother to say enough about it here. If you like Eclectic Beautiful Love, keep an eye out for it and keep an eye out for my new film.
neg Although the movie is so decrepit I have to give this magnificent performance a miss. Because I really can't believe anyone would do this great. I couldn't buy this movie in cinemas, it was either me or a friend who was in the theater watching the whole movie, it was either my home entertainment, or through a VHS. The acting is terrible, and it is almost painful to watch. It is hard to get over to, as it is so much more difficult now. I had to wait a while for the video release. It was good to see the new material in cinemas. But it is still an enjoyable movie to watch. Don't get me started on the preview before it's over.
neg This film is a great mystery movie. There were definitely elements that should have been hidden in the title but were hidden in the story. There were definitely elements that should have been mentioned a bit early in the film about the mysterious girl in the movie but were not. Also, some sub plots were not even worth elementary school books. In the end I think the creators wanted to use some of the best script they could possibly get their child to do and to give an even better finish to it. This is one of those cases. You don't need a million dollar budget to make a great film like this but you do need an extraordinary amount of faith. If you can't get a half-way decent job, this film is a great idea.
neg This is not your average horror film. Not enough families can afford to rent an expensive cinema in a big village in order to afford the rent. You know, the rent is a "rent" and it is usually a "comedy" village rent for a night. So it is considered a good idea to rent an expensive cinema in order to save money. This means that your entertainment needs stacking up, and that you will be unable to afford to do it
neg This film is so bad it makes me grind my teeth and wish they would have pulled this off instead of this lame horror movie. It continues with the same lame acting, music and bad directing throughout the entire film. There are times where I felt like I was reading a book about how to become a good actress and how to become a good actress in this technological Age, and I was reading about how to become a good actress in a hapless Hollywood. It was just as bad as Bimbo's "Hamlet" came out. I realize that
neg This film is extremely long and is extremely long, and is extremely boring. It shows very little interest in the characters, the plot, or plot at all. It continues to show that Western Hollywood is not very good at casting and so, too successfully, every time a new movie is made. It portrays a lot of different characters from different classes and classes and classes in different parts of Hollywood. Westerns have always had a terrible, boring, static, boring western in their story and this film is not so different. Westerns are not good at portraying westerns and all form a narrative into a bunch of cr*p*p. That being said, if you like a good western, keep an eye out for this film, especially if you are a major hottie.
neg Seriously, though, this is a good movie. Very good acting by a great supporting cast. Plot, Acting and Acting were among the better things I've ever seen in my life. Very well paced and believable. I can't speak to all of the plot, characters, plot or psychology in this movie, and I can only speak to two of the main characters that were introduced by Saw. I mentioned the 3 previous movies that were good for me: A) The Three Stooges (martin I recommend it because it was the best movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch) which makes it easier to connect them all to the events in the movie (martin II), B) a nice piece of advice for anyone needing a break in the wall (martin II), C) a nice piece of advice for anyone needing to build a house in order to stay overnight, and D) a nice message from my lovely Fay Wray (martin II). It all started with a very nice little girl named Fay (martin II). I really liked how this little girl looked and so much of what I did with her. She was pretty at the beginning of the movie. She would sneakily talk about how nice
neg This is a terrible movie. It isn't funny, bad acting, bad directing. It's not funny at all, it is just plain old boring. People getting hit in the head with soap smarmy little girl psychology can get a few stitches in after a while and still get thru it. The prank phone calls and other stupid crap they were able to get were actually very funny. I can barely get thru it even though I know it sounds exciting. What I hear in my head is how much my life has changed over the course
neg Although most journalists write their diatribe about something they don't like (particularly, men), I found myself laughing a few times throughout the movie. There were jokes (cf. arachnid, arachnid-type jokes), and the ending was mildly funny. Of course, some of these jokes were poorly put together. I wish I would have been able to rewrite them better, but I can't think of a better way to put them all together. The characters were not so well developed throughout the movie. None of them really make sense in the first place, and in the end they all seem somewhat contrived. Of course, some of the jokes are amusing in parts, such as when they use the "carrot" or "stick" (cf. arachnid, arachnid). Of course, all of the above mentioned incidents are not funny in themselves. None of the characters were particularly interesting in the end. The plot was just so broken down that I actually felt ripped off halfway through it. All of the jokes were lame, and thus ended up with only funny scenes. None of the other jokes (cf. arachnid jokes) were particularly funny, and all were
neg This film is extremely poor. There are no great strengths or bad script readings here, just plain old boring plot twists and unimaginative acting. I highly recommend this film to anyone needing an example of a plot to understand the meaning of a certain movie, no matter how bad the script may be. If you've watched or are looking for a good western/open minded movie for the 3 months before this movie, then you owe it to this magnificent, complete and insightful portrait of your spiritual journey. Its length is only slightly less than that of Kenneth Branagh's "In the Line of Fire" and its cinematography ruins your patience. 9 out of 10 stars!!! Definitely recommend this film!!! If you are looking for a good western/open minded martial arts film with lots of bloodshed, be it. A solid western with good acting and good direction can be found in this film.
neg A disappointing film. Very disappointing. Very disappointing. I am extremely disappointed with this movie. What I liked about this movie was how the story was almost painful and ground-breaking. This movie has no redeeming virtue and I would recommend it for those who appreciate the realism. Very disappointing. 7/10
neg Seriously, if you're a fan of western movies, this movie would be for you. It would be fun to watch in some of your favorite places around the world, meet up with some good friends who will help you out, and then head back to where you came from.I'm getting a lot tired now, so I thought I would give this one a chance.
neg I wanted to make this movie about my experiences growing up with sexually exploited children. My mother, sister, and I were all victims of sexual violence, and I have hardened to this movie over the years, and it continues to struggle with me every time. There are times I feel as though I am unable to take blame for my daughter's sexual needs and desires, or the constant bullying and bullying from my male friends. So this movie is about what ails us when we are young and we are all too young to be in relationships. It is about our futures as people, not our futures as an added sexual attraction to those around us. If you are a huge fan of Jeffrey Konvitz, watch it. It is the only movie that I can give you an example of how to become a good person. Its an extremely long, drawn out story. I know some parents will cry for the kids when they hear the story of how they were molested by their daughter. It is not the greatest movie I have ever had the misfortune to watch, it just brought it to my attention that it is so well-written, that even the most infantile viewers can understand the subtleties. It is an intelligent, funny

neg In terms of quality, quality and quantity it is hard to say that Technicolor isn't a great film. I think that Technicolor is better than 90% of what it is now. It may be flawed, but the quality and quantity make it worth watching. Worth watching.
neg After watching this film I complained to the director about how bad it looked and looked like in the theater. I complained to him about the lighting and how it was so dark in some parts that it compelled me to go into my own personal space and read some books on how to make a good horror film that I hadn't actually learned how to make yet. Needless to say, it looked ugly and budget non existent. How could I possibly complain? I had no idea what it looked like when it was first put on screen. How anyone can conceive that such a thing could be considered a good horror film, I must have been completely bored throughout the entire film.

neg This film is extremely disturbing and frankly awful. I stand corrected. This film was filmed on location, filmed with a very different set design than most horror movies. My local cinema is not as gruesome as some might think but still has moments of tremendous terror and shock value. The sound and image quality are disturbing and there are some very disturbing scenes. The acting is not as gruesome as some might think. The entire film is a cheap rip-off of a well-known horror movie horror movie with 80's violence and 50's humor. This movie did not deserve the PG rating and should be ashamed of themselves. It was released in the USA on DVD. MediaBlind was responsible for releasing it. MediaBlind is responsible for this film. MediaBlind is responsible for releasing this movie on DVD. MediaBlind also responsible for releasing the original horror movies and graphic novel. This movie has been banned from all cinemas in the USA.

neg This isn't the greatest movie I've ever seen, but hey, it was entertaining enough to keep my interest throughout. Once I got my $3.00 in it I found myself laughing a few times. Of course I liked and became very attached to Sofia Coppola, and even though I did not like the direction of the film, I still greatly enjoyed it. Of course, I watched the whole film, in my mind, and I still can't seem to muster the strength to say "Did I miss something?". Luckily, I found a little hidden treasure hidden away in my collection. I've found this far too... far down in the Harry Potter world. This film is so...amazing. Not many movies I've ever seen where the villain is the hero. They always seemed to be talking about the end of things, and even though I was unable to connect the plot to any plot it was still entertaining to watch. I watched the whole movie, and thought, "Did I miss something?". Was there something valuable in it? Did it really hurt? Did I miss something valuable? Perhaps it was that I liked the ending of the story, not as much as I did.
neg This film is an extremely weak film, but hey, hey, it's good fun and not bad at all. I liked it a lot when it came out in cinemas and because it came out so quickly. I would recommend this to anyone needing an excuse to let their fears get the better of them. The action in the climax of the movie was poor, and the fight scenes were almost non-existent, as was the way the movie ended. It was robotic, and thus ended up with the hero actually fighting his way through an extremely badly shot. The fight itself was pointless. This is a good lesson for all martial arts fans of all ages and experience.
neg The Theory Of Flight is an engaging, fun, and unique account of the famed "Auction House" that has been operating in the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico. James Arness has written some of the finest literary and artistic work of his career, including some of the best-known literary collaborations between Austin and Texan writers, Brian Keith, and Dan Harmon. As we all know and Zelenka is a huge fan of Americana. Its story is a great mystery to those who've ever been to Austin. This is one of the great literary events of the American South, yet its story is almost non-existent (c/art) in some parts. It is a great mystery to those people who appreciate the mystery and mystery surrounding this great cultural event. This great mystery is what happened to my mother when her brother got knocked backward over a cliff edge while in the Texas mountains, and it continues to haunt her every time he is out with a drink or two. When I was little, my sister had a hard time with her, but nowadays she's moved on to better things and more important things, and she still has dug her grave. But it's not
neg This is probably the worst horror film I've ever seen. Even writer Roger Bohbotzk's matte work looks ugly. Overall, it is just plain awful. The only redeeming feature of the film is the ending.
neg I can tell you one thing about the new Star Wars film The Crocodile Hunter: Warrior Princess and the Beauty Queen. The two main characters are very well portrayed in the film. They all have very different stories, very different stories that seem unrelated at first but then you have them in the same movie, and you get to know them well beyond that. The Crocodile Hunter is a very interesting character, as well as the main antagonist, who always liked to be first introduced to the audience by referring to himself as "The Crocodile Hunter". I mentioned before that I enjoyed the confrontation between the main bad guy and his daughter Myrna in Beauty Queen: Warrior Princess. The bad guy had no problem with getting the daughter out of a relationship with the spoiled, but he did it out of desperation because he thought that Myrna was too big for him and that he should just give her back to the good guys. So, after several tries and the tide turns in his direction, he finally has to actually step inside the "boy". This is rather unusual, as always. He has resorted to using a hidden camera to slice up the living things in his world and does a really good job of that. Overall, it
neg This movie was extremely weak and did not really hve much in it. However, the story established that there was a plot, a plot and quality of acting in it. All the characters were mentioned mostly in the opening scenes, and the few who actually came into the movie were either poorly developed, poorly developed (they just seemed like they came into their own in some way) or had very little depth in them. I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting a good western to watch this classic on DVD, because its length provides opportunity for a viewing that you won't find in a region outside of the US. All of the characters were mentioned quite a bit in the opening and in the closing scenes. Im glad that they were mentioned so much, because even though the plot was weak, its plot still provides opportunity for a good introduction to this movie. I would recommend it to anyone wanting a good western to watch, and because it was clever and quality, to experience the entire story in your own time and place. Worth

The acting is weak, Karen Black is simply not as good as she was ten years ago. But, this is still considered a good movie. I would definitely recommend it to anyone needing an example of bad acting, bad scripts, and/or an example of bad acting in general. This movie was better. Good acting, good script, good acting. Bad script = Bad script.
neg This was a disappointing film, but it continues to entertain me despite its disappointing start.I actually like the cast, the direction is entertaining and the story is free of charge. This film is about an American family that was separated from their daughter and their two great-grandfathers. The family is very poor. They don't have enough to provide for the elderly and it is hard to get a job, especially with a young sister. The entire family is dependent upon the government to provide for their needs. The government seems intent on keeping the poor people out of the poverty row and into welfare poverty. There are two very poor people in this family, both of whom are working, in the same job. In principle, they should be given a chance to come back to see their 'American' again. However, we have to ask if they want to live in poverty in the near future and should just give it a chance.
neg This movie wasn't 100% boring. There was a lot going on and a lot going on that I really didn't like. I think this movie was boring because I watched it with my friends who always insisted on being nice and not make fun of us. I wanted to watch every single episode of Survivor Series 2001: There were only two Survivor Series 2001: There was no true Survivor Series 2001. The series was about defending our European empires against an imaginary invasion by outsiders. It was about the ultimate homesteading of an independent nation. The plot was very silly and at times felt quite formulated. There was nothing positive about it. The focus of the movie was on defending our own in the early 1900s. This movie had to be about the invasion of our great nation by an American family pretending to want to make a build up of their own in order to get 750,000 dollars provided they can eat a million dollars of whatever they want. If you can't get 750, you must not watch this movie. If you can't get 750 you must wait... watch this movie. This is the best thing you can do! (Acceptance of guilt?) This movie wasn't good! I wish I knew better how to watch
neg A disappointing movie in which a young Brad Pitt steals the show (yes, that was a spoof) as a big bad guy and gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous local sheriff. Pitt pulls the show apart in a key scene by setting up shop in his home town of Des Plaines, New York, and using his trusted local sheriff to make a phony wedding in his name. The real heroes are the gay newspaper critic (Lydia) and his wife (Lydia). The real heroes are the rage and poverty of their immigrant/white male friends who always go to extreme lengths to get what they want. (Both good and bad) and the love of their kids (Matuschek & Ditz). (Seriously, I can't believe it happens.) The main disadvantage of this movie is the fact that it doesn't really stray far from being funny in some of its jokes. The plot is a tad contrived. Pitt pulls the show apart in a key scene, and manages to convince the audience that he really is a big bad guy. What kind of dumbass would you think? A midget thief steals a big diamond in a big diamond deal with the local sheriff (Joseph), and gets himself kicked

Definitely recommend it for anyone needing an example of how to act in a big budget movie like "Silverado" or "Happiness" and "True" movies. It has great acting and is a great fun to watch even though it is hidden away in the story. I found myself laughing a lot throughout the entire film. I won't bother rehashing the plot, because I thought it was cleverly put together. It was clever how they put together a good group of actors, each with his or her own unique take on the character. This movie really grabs me by the proverbial balls through it. It doesn't hurt that they didn't have a plot too bad, and it is clever to realize that all the characters are likable and not all that bad. I love it.

The villain/villain is very well-developed and even though he's a relatively recent character, we still have some good plot twists and a decent cast. Overall, a definite must watch.
neg This movie is like 90s garbage. There are trash talk about the 3 protagonists being too young for their parts and too young to be involved in a plot, and there are scenes that seem like the only two of the protagonists are either asleep or in someane mental disarray, and there are scenes that seem like non sequiters because they were warned not to do so. This movie had a good pace and the action was conducted at a high level. Not an awful lot of bloodshed, but there were definitely some pretty funny scenes. Overall, this movie was entertaining for the entire movie. The story was well paced and there was some fun to be had in it.I can accept the conclusion if the movie wasn't good, and maybe the story would have improved had the ending been a bit nicer.
neg Seriously this movie was so lame. Not even the most lame of the bunch of them can work it out. I really like animated shows, movies with gratuitous violence. It was so weak it almost made me wish I was in North Africa or something. All I hear from Africa is "There are things in Africa which we can do nothing about...". Thats not how Africa is run, it is a bunch of white people with bigoted agendas who want to destroy Africa and the rest of Africa. Its the story. Africa is still brutal, and its still a struggle for independence and justice in Africa. Africa is still brutal. Its still a struggle for independence. It is not over yet. Its not over. And that Africa is still the story, its not about Africa, it is Africa in which Africa is not so much of a struggle. The stories are not about Africa, Africa is Africa. Africa is Africa. Africa is Africa. Africa is Africa. Africa is Africa. Africa is Africa. Africa is Africa. Africa. The vastness of Africa is Africa. And Africa is Africa. Africa is the story. Africa is Africa.

neg This is so good, so bad, it makes me sick to think that I'm getting tired of writing about this topic. My thoughts are now to rest and focus on the movie and not my entertainment. This is the worst movie ever made! If you want to be a part of the making of this film, skip this and get an independent movie!
neg This is a very good horror film that has absolutely nothing to recommend it. If you like horror movies and you like inciteful lyrics and fast paced action it's a definite must watch. If you're into that sort of thing, go buy it. You won't get a copy of Soul Survivors Unlimited if it comes in the same box. This is an extremely good horror movie, but it is still enjoyable. If you're looking for an excuse to let this film go, this film may be for you.

Luckily, this movie did not hurt me too much, though I did wish it would have. The plot was extremely poor. Not even one episode worth elementary school-level drama can save this movie from being pulled into the mix by this guy. So... skip this!
neg This movie was mildly entertaining and fun. My expectations were high, but I expected an enjoyable and quality film. It was inspired by Jeffrey Konvitz' contribution to the original 1934 classic ''A Perfect Murder Mystery of the Wax Museum of America'. This is a genuine British mystery. The Wax Museum of America is the brainchild of the famed Wax Museum of America and is responsible for the crimes that are still unsolved. The crimes are the result of an artist's laboratory that has mysteriously been altered since World War II. During World War II, Dr. Otto von Niemann, the Nazi Hall Monitors (BÃ¼rgermeister, Horrible, Sexist, and low class) made numerous mental illnesses, including those of a form reputed to haunt the Wax Museum in New York, and through it through von Niemann's constant promotion of the Nazi Hall Monitors' agendas. To complicate matters, von Niemann has been working in a mental institution for more

neg This movie is extremely weak, and does not really deliver much action, nor does it deliver much action in the way of a high school football film. It is extremely weak, in fact, and is almost completely devoid of any action at all. It has a very good opening reel, and a good opening and ending. But then there are some brilliant supporting characters, and the acting is just awful. I found the hotel in Budapest, Hungary very quiet, and not that bad. But in the end, it all came together with beautiful, earth-shaking Hungarian life. I loved the hotel. And I really, really, love the movie. It's so much more than I like about this movie; it's such a romantic love story. (Or at least I love Catherine Sloper in "Dear Friends" from "Dear Friends" (1999). Beautiful Hungarian life. I really can't recommend it to anyone.
neg This film is not 100% pornographic, however the story has some pretty lame plot twists and a few scenes that seem silly and amateurish. I had thought this would be an interesting film to watch but was pleasantly surprised by it's speed and cast in a good way. Overall, this is an enjoyable film with good pace and direction.I absolutely loved the concept of the Three Ages in the Harry Potter world and especially during the party scenes where they first meet up with their blood-soaked friends in the hope that they might one day be able to get some sleep and happiness. It is clever how they both seem to be talking about the future when they talk about the Three Ages. They both seem to be discussing the history of mankind and history, which is a very good lesson for all ages and all levels of human interaction. The Three Ages is the theme and setting for the entire film. I found it particularly heart-wrenching how they both seem to be discussing the Three Ages versus the rest of the world in their dialogues, the characters, and even the setting itself. It's nice to see people getting a good grasp on what the Three Ages really is and just having fun with it. It's nice that the

neg I realize the story is so lame that I can barely breath the breathing space it takes to get them out of my head. I know I must have been reading too much into the story and maybe it's time for a more digestible version. This would be nice to have seen here in the shops or an old railway waiting room, but this isn't what this movie was about. There were some brilliant visual performances and some really beautiful scenes in the railway waiting room scene. The railway porter in his shop was not so discriminating and he let the railway porter go through his usual errand boy routine and it didn't take him long to figure out what he was doing - hence the railway porter refusing to let him into the waiting room. Even more important - the porter kept his view perfectly controlled by the porter who was handling the porter's errand boy, so we had no idea who was making the call. The railway porter kept the porter honest throughout. I am pleased that he finally let the porter know that he wasn't discriminating. The railway porter obviously knew better than that and
neg This movie was so much fun to watch, it was fun to watch and the entire cast was sooo young and evil. I have seen many horror movies over the years but none of them were able to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles. This was so good that I actually turned down a ticket. I was in a mental institution for awhile and it didn't hurt that I was able to do so much. Luckily, the director (James Arness, writer/director) gave me a great dose of love this movie. James Arness, writer/director of LV. 8, helmed this movie. I couldn't have asked for more from my local cinema like this because I would have been spoiled for this movie, but I will never watch it again.
neg This extremely weak and infantile movie was 100% boring and did not follow suit to its budget. Not even the first episode, "Silverado" and "Cop And The Mystery" came close to being that good. Of course, most of the characters were already established and the plot was similar to that of "Silverado" or "Cop And The Mystery" from previous movies. However, this movie has the feel of being a rip-off of "Silverado" or similar, and is basically operating at the level of a high school play-that's become a cultural myth. It's like elementary school play, in that all students are expected to doze off to the "cool" side of things and get some sleep, while at the same time being expected to do some serious
neg This movie had no violence, nor did it have the fun to let loose a plot, nor did it stray too far from the book. It did not deserve to be overshadowed by the likes of "Hamlet" or "Hamlet". What an enjoyable movie!!! This movie is just plain fun. I love the new music! It really grabs my heart!!! (Acceptance/Happiness - I don't really give this movie any special love...it was just "Hamlet" on the soundtrack) - it really grabs my heart!!! Enjoy!!! Music by D.R. and The Ghost Train (part of 'Nightmares' series).
neg This movie is an extremely entertaining horror movie. The entire cast is entertaining and there is just one character you don't mess with. Its main disadvantage is that the story is so broken down that there isn't even a plot to it. So if you are looking for an excuse to get carried away, skip this movie and get an independent film (where are the bad guys?).
neg This movie is not a great movie at all. There is no violence used in it, it is a cleverly acted thriller about a young man's struggles with love and the loss of a mother in the last stages of an interracial relationship. The love story between a black friend and white friend is played out over a four-year-old girl in what seems like an interracial relationship. You see the story from beginning to the very end and the struggle is played out in your mind as the viewer gets to know and ultimately, the two of you get to see it for the first time. It is interesting how Anastasia Farlan (Farrell) and her sidekick, Erin Gallagher (Margaret Sullavan) try to force their love story into focus, especially since Farlan is so discriminating. Gallagher is the kind of prick you would not mind being in this movie. (Acceptance of all things) This movie is fun and it is a good movie. It has nice and engaging acting, nice dialogue, and superb filming. Overall a great movie for those people who enjoy being "American" (and don't mind the racial stereotyping) but still want an actual "American" or "American" experience
neg I was young when this film came out, and this is still fresh and funny. It was funny, at times funny, at times tense, and at times I felt like I was reading a novel. My favorite character in the movie was Kitty, who always skitters a bit when faced with the possibility of being asked for her heart-throbs. I like how Kitty always skitters a little bit when faced with the possibility of being asked for her blood type. She keeps it to a very low level, so she doesn't get too carried away with the guilt she feels when it's all over her. I would rewrite the scene a little more like this: "Acceptance of the ultimate sort is not supposed to happen to all young men.
neg This is a great cultural event and has brought together fans of all ages and general entertainment to a comfortable, comfortable setting. I loved the feel of being in North Africa, and I had the great fun playing the Tamahori with my Tamahori friends. I am pleased that there are two of my male friends (martin sheen and her fiance) in this film, and that there is a saying in the Tamahori community that, no matter how high class you are, no matter how white you are, the Tamahori community will always be there for you.I was ready to shoot one scene out of fear that the audience would get bored halfway through and get bored in the end. Now it is my ambition to shoot another great cultural event in the Tamahori mountains. I will be drawing from the comments and memories of all those who know the Tamahori history, and I will be doing so with more of the original cast.The cast is excellent. Margaret Sullavan is an exceptional actress, with an irresistible acting performance that will keep you laughing and loving every moment she plays. Margaret Ogden is one of the sweetest and most charming people you will ever know. She is often played by
neg This film is mildly entertaining and I really enjoyed it. I think the graphics and dialogue were pulled out of thin air and simply didn't move along that well. Overall this film is mildly entertaining and fun to watch. I really enjoyed it when it came out in theaters so that I could enjoy it. (If you're a fan of animated shows it might be on your wish list, go to this great man's home, and watch it until the end of the movie and get a goodie from the couch or something like that in the future!) It is also very well-written. Very entertaining! Enjoy it!
neg This film is so dense and uninteresting, you actually feel the need for a tissue change to get a good grasp on what it is. There are two basic stories in it. The first centers around an old monk (Bonham-Carter) who desires to adopt a son from a "kirin rider" (martinari), a pet that serves as spiritual champion in the Alamo. After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile (Carter eventually gets along with his new pet) he finally gets his foot in the door and gets in line with the new "kirin rider" (Carter). Shortly after that they both embrace one another like they were siblings, but this relationship eventually leads them into serious disarray when the two are separated. The other story involves a young monk (Bonham-Carter) who wants to adopt a pet from another "kirin rider" (Carter) that he has chosen not to adopt. On the one hand, Bonham-Carter seems very good with his new pet in mind, but he still has an unhealthy amount of self-absorbed love and all the rage in his life. This young monk (Carter)is basically a spoiled, bigoted bigoted pervert who wants to adopt
neg This movie is extremely disturbing and frankly, I don't know where this movie came from. It is the worst horror movie I've ever seen, period. It has a terrible cast that often slows down and has them all shot in some horrible way, some of them even worse than before. The acting is horrible, the dialogue is just plain boring and uninteresting. Overall, it is very disappointing.I will be honest with you and all of the reviews in this movie. Overall, it is not a great movie. I can't recommend this movie to anyone. If you like horror movies, this is one of your best days away from home and maybe even better this movie would be.
neg I found myself laughing a few times in my sleep, hating the thought that I was leaving a disgusting film in my collection.I would have paid far less attention to the depiction of the geriatric ensemble than to the depiction of the geriatric ensemble. None of them portrayed the geriatric ensemble in this film, and they were unremarkable actors who practiced some kind of mental disarray in their routines, mostly through repetitive routines and other weak scenes. I also disliked their performance in this film, and so I turned to the "media", mostly because I wanted to watch more films about geriatric ensemble acting. When I saw "True", it was at the 50'sTh Gothenburg Film Festival, and in the early '70s when I was near the beginning of my career. When I saw it I became very bored, and became even more disturbed by how it all came together in this film. What a plot! I really, really don't know what to make of this film. Maybe I saw a different version of this in a different way, but this is sooo much better. I like surprises and surprises. The ending seems to be a little contrived (although I've read the trivia, I can't find
neg I wanted to ask you about your view on violence in your native Africa, Africa, and the rest of Africa. Africa is not the greatest place on earth. Africa is not as vast as some of Africa, but it is the region that most desperately needs it. Africa has the most extreme poverty in Africa, and is considered a "sanctuary" of Africa. Its citizens are often poor and have few resources. There is a large amount of violence used against people that want to live in poverty. Africa is not Africa. Its people are not poor, and they have resorted to violence in a variety of ways to get what they want: food, shelter, and from an overburdened and repressed Africa. Africa is not Africa. Its culture is Africa. Its culture is Africa. It has always been Africa, and the people that make it happen are the "enjoys". Africa is Africa. This is Africa.

neg This movie was extremely disappointing and very disappointing. How can you possibly say that it was 100% bad? Well, I think 90% of it was probably because of the sound and direction in the background and the lighting. The sound effects were disturbing and some were definitely gratuitous. I'm pretty sure the sound effects were distorted, some of them were drowned out completely due to the background, some were drowned out completely because of the background.I was in a very dark house, with no neighbors, and in my home. I heard the sound of shattering
neg This was just a compilation of recycled material. No one really liked or cared who wrote the lyrics to the song, nor did they deserve any of it. Music was OK for rock n roll fans, but not enough to let the fans know this was a compilation of crap. Not even George Kennedy's grooving in "Silverado" can save the day! Music was OK, but not enough to convince the audience that this was meant for rock n roll fans. The song "Silverado" came from the viewpoint of a man with an eye for football, and it shows. It has to be the best song in the entire world to ever grace the American stage, no matter how high class you are, you can still get it onto the big screen and enjoy it on the biggest stage you can enjoy. The only problem I had with this movie was that it did not follow suit to most of the guidelines for how to do it. The only
neg It was inspired by a novel I own, by an American reviewer, writer, and critic of literary and artistic critic Robert Gray. Gray was a critic and critic for a British newspaper, and wrote letters to the government in London. After several newspaper stories were written about Gray, I finally got a chance to see the new reviewer, and he quickly put a positive focus on the literary, giving me a chance to see a new writer. My expectations were not so high. Dougray was extremely kind, and I just felt he was doing his best to make the most of my time away from home. This was an exceptionally poor film that I would have paid far less attention to at the time, since it came out in theaters and I expected to see more in the near future.
neg I just can't believe this whole thing is still fresh and funny. It was inspired by a novel I like, the Grimms of Giada Colagrande, and it continues to look and act fresh even though I've read a lot more into it. I can breath it inside this movie. I can't believe what I'm saying. What the heck?! I can't believe anyone says this movie has zombies in it. Don't get me started on the preview too early!
neg I can accept that. I congratulate myself for not wasting money on an all-star cast that I had previously admired and that I had seen a slew of good horror movies in my time. This is a real shame because I saw lots of good horror movies that were not rated R.Nonetheless, I have to give this movie a miss. It is still entertaining and fun to watch as the stranger who always has a "holiday" in his life (and especially during the day) waits for a new friend (martin) to come along. If it wasn't for the Ghost Train in the early 80s, I still wouldn't have made this film. I would have been thrilled to see this instead of the typical spookfest in my collection, but alas, it is now disposed of and replaced with a much funnier, more comic-dynamic version. My wish is that my local video store would not close down this movie theater, because all it brings is violence to your collection.
neg This was one of the worst movies ever made. No violence, no lewdness. A compilation of recycled material that was mildly entertaining and funny. Not many children can understand what I'm saying here and why I am so excited to see it again. What a wonderful experience it has been! I absolutely loved it and I wish Alicia Silverstone would come out of this film in the future! This is one of the sweetest romantic comedies ever! (Besides that, this one was among my favorites of all time. It was also one of the worst films ever made, and I must have watched over half a dozen of them. Of course, all of these films were awful and did not deserve the Oscar. All of them are excellent films, and this one is one of them. Its just that bad. The acting was horrible, and there was a gratuitous nipple play in some of the leading scenes. The only redeeming feature was the way in which the heroine was able to take the lead role, which was hilarious, and the ending even gave Alicia Silverstone an Oscar for her performance. She had absolutely no fun in it. No matter how bad it was, Alicia's performance was still outstanding, and the acting was
neg I sat down to watch this movie and I complained about it every time I saw it. I thought about the quality of the dialogue in my mind, and the way the subtitles portrayed the dialog. I complained about how many subtitles seemed like they were glued together. That way, no matter how long the movie was in, it still seemed like a good movie.I will give the movie 3 stars because of its quality. The acting was good, the story was interesting, and most important of all was that it had a good direction. There were a few mistakes throughout the entire film. The most obvious was the use of black-on-white or black-on-white to simply uphold the mystery regarding the crimes in the early 80's. The crimes themselves were not interesting. The plot was poor and thus its conclusion was not even worth elementary school-level dialog. The only fun I had with this movie was its conclusion. I wish there was a better ending to it, but I don't think that anyone should give it a chance. You should give this film 2.5 stars to all the movies out there. Don't fail to watch it.
neg The movie had no violence, no lewdness, no lewdness, no lewdness of any kind. All portrayals were just jokes. Not even the most gruesome scenes were shocking. And there were gratuitous sex scenes in which an added extras were just icing on the already-cutesy mess. It was nice to see the gay newspaper criticise the gay newspaper critic as critic of a newspaper critic, while the gay newspaper critic really didn't deserve this much of credit.I will read every single piece of the glowing reviews I can find and comment on my thoughts as well. How can I possibly wrap this up? So I'll just say that it was a good movie, good comedy, good script, good direction, and maybe even better than White Chicks if I saw it in theaters.
neg This movie is not a good movie at all. It just keeps you amused throughout the entire movie. You should give it a chance.
neg Although discussing the films, I think that the focus of the film was on comedic rather than drama. The acting and the direction seemed aimless, and even though there were barely any extras (producers, writers, etc) I was able to find them all in some of my favourite places in the world, such as the Middle Eastern Plains, Central and South. I was able to find all the famous faces of the different empires that make up the fictional

neg I just want to go home. How do I feel about this movie? I don't know. I just can't seem to muster the strength to say that this movie is not a good movie at all. The narration, as every movie reviewer already knows, was at times somewhat contrived and at times felt a bit out of place. Overall, this movie was probably better than the first but still tame. Not even George Kennedy deserved a 7/10 from Burt Reynolds as a hero to this magnificent and unique martial arts film. The action was a bit dodgy and some of the fight choreography (particularly the archers) were speeded up a bit but otherwise interesting. Anderson vosloo was entertaining and Jet Li (martin I am referring to her as Kitty) was entertaining, she was entertaining and Jet did a bit of good work with her. I think the villain was too good to be in this movie. Anderson vosloo was just about as good as a bad dream sequence in a bad dream sequence as some of the bad dream sequences were. This movie probably has the worst dream sequence in the entire movie history. You remember when a dream sequence involves you and the monster, in some way, causing you
neg This extremely weak Australian excuse for a motion picture is sick, twisted and almost devoid of any redeeming virtue. Of course, the government has already started a murder mystery, but no one really knows who or what is behind the plot and no matter how high level you can get caught up in it, it will be revealed in the coming months. So apart from the usual self deprecation, it is extremely poor, and frankly uninspired. As for the acting, the producers are playing an extremely poor, amateurish, and uninspired version of a hit-man/stooge in a ludicrous plot that revolves around a motley group of people (with the exception of an added extras) that need stacking in order to get food, shelter, and shelter from the elements. The humour is weak, and is almost completely devoid of any redeeming virtue. Even the most infantile viewer will justifiably feel ripped off after seeing the cruel death of their loved ones in this harsh, yet still funny and touching portrayal of their story. This is the shoddy journalism I've come to despise and it continues to wreak havoc on my patience and sanity. Not even the most intelligent viewers can help themselves to appreciate how this weak
pos My favorite character is Regina. Regina is often depicted as the bad girl, often in bad roles and bad roles, often in bad roles. But Regina is still an interesting character to watch and will make you appreciate Regina for life. She has the qualities of many of the stereotypical bad guys in the story, but in some parts, she really grabs the big bad guy by the proverbial balls and takes him through her in some spectacular and ground-breaking ways. Regina is also extremely good with the kids, the heroines, the bad guys, the bad guys, and the bad guys. All of these evil are mentioned in the book but rarely in the movie. This little girl has talent and will make you forget who she really is after all. She is still very good with the kids, she is still very good with the kids, and she is still very good as the bad girl. Regina is still a very good actress and actress, and she makes a great impression on kids by the way. She is still a fantastic actress, and if you can't get the older sister you must be a horrible sister. If you want an example of how bad Regina looks like as a big bad girl, I won't bother citing her here
pos This is so very good that I actually turned in and out of it. (This was the greatest moviegoing experience of my life.)I wish that I could give this movie 4 stars, but alas, they came out of it. I wish that somebody out there would give this magnificent, enchanting love story of love and tragedy (and maybe even an entire musical) an even closer watch. I wish that instead of being told the story in a black and white print, I'd get to see more beautiful pictures, and maybe even a real-life version. Maybe that would have been a better ending...maybe a little less. Maybe this movie would have been pulled off deeper into the story, maybe even a little more interesting. But it is worth it. I can't seem to muster the strength to say that I would recommend this movie to anyone.
pos Very disappointingThis movie had me in stitches all over the family, hating the rats and how they always kept me from moving even though I was out of the house. This is not a horror movie at all. It has a nice dark humor about the life we had, it has nice, old-fashioned monsters (spirits), bad guys (the bad guys) and what a bunch of them try to do in this movie. The plot was predictable and uninteresting. It was inspired by the old school students' "Quits" movie. This movie was really fun to watch and it had fun to watch as they did it. Everyone who loves the old schoolhouse humor should give this movie a chance! It's great cinema and all that.

pos This movie is a great movie. It really grabs us by the proverbial balls, makes us grind our teeth with despair, makes us grind our teeth into sudden victory, and then all at the same time reminds us that there is no such thing as justice in this world. It's the exact opposite of the "American dream" Hollywood often uphold. We are told not to do this, because we are told not to do it. Our lesson in life, and how to become a better person, is to always give every bit of our time to the best of your efforts, and always remember to stack all the books, plan your own, meet the person, make the last 20 minutes, and go to bed. This movie really grabs us by the proverbial balls. Our school board member got kicked in the balls not enough for him to register with his new 'dream' that this movie would become a reality. We all know that dreamers dream, and we all do them, every time we step on the settee, wishing we were there. All the while hating this movie, hating it, hating every moment we get to see this movie, hating the woman with the sunglasses and the long hair that comes in to her outfit
pos This film was so very good, that I actually felt bad for myself. The acting was weak and there was just no blood in it. I can't really say enough about it to give you the bad reviews you would get if this were made in a real time-waster. Rating: 7/10
pos This movie was so much fun to watch. It was fun to do a variety of things and characters that lent themselves to our hero's journey. I loved the way he dove into a story about a young man's struggles with various mental issues, from the very beginning to the very end. It was fun to support my friends through the pain and hurt, and to support the people that I love. I love San Fernando Red West (Red West) and his new girlfriend, Ava Gardner (Lydia). She is a sweetie closet queen from Texas, and we have a very special love story going on in her life. I love San Fernando Red West and his love of Tex. The movie was fun to watch and make memories of and especially his daughter, Jasmine Red West (red West from "The Rock of Ages" TV program, who I am very fond of), and his wife, Georgia. I love them both and wish Alicia Silverstone would have made this movie.

pos So far, it seems that Netflix shows that people can do anything they want without getting a single Netflix or DVD. They've got some good movies, a nice cast, and all that, I am still in no way complaining. I just want to make sure that every Netflix reviewer I've ever watched, every time, and every time I go to see an episode of it again will find something interesting about it. If you've seen "Last Seduction" and you've seen the original Mr. Show, you'll probably have seen it first time round. And I don't mean Mr. Show. You'll probably also see his new series with more of the same charm and professionalism. The series is pretty entertaining (and maybe it would have been pulled off without Mr. Show), and I recommend it. If you want to watch Mr. Show again after it falls apart and find something interesting to watch again, watch it again! (If you can't wait, buy it now!) If you like Mr. Show in the early 90's, this is an enjoyable movie for those who love the mystery and mystery surrounding Mr. Show and want to delve into his life. I highly recommend it to those viewers who love mystery and mystery

The entire film (and part of it) is extremely disturbing, as you can see from the start to the finish, with the constant stream of sexually abusing, the constant stream of begging and the constant threat of being "felted". Many of the characters are mentioned a lot, as if the creator intended for this film to be about love or not love. There is even a scene in which a young man is strangled to death because he did not have enough children. This is so bad, that even though I was unable to fathom all the horror, it was still worth the movie. I had no idea this movie would become such a cultural myth within the gay community in this town, or what it would have been.
pos Timberlake's performance is still among the top ten motion pictures in the history of cinema. Though his most recent feature film, Edge of Reality, has made an impression on the audience at large since its release and it continues to inspire us all through its conclusion. Edge of Reality showcases the talent and expertise of Brad Pitt as an exceptional programmer and programmer. The story revolves around a young Brad Pitt (Frank Morgan) who finds himself placed in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party. After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, Pitt and his friends are finally reunited after a break up and they enlist the managerial expertise of a newly-installed mental institution. Along the way they enlist the managerial expertise of a newly-installed medical genius, Dr. Lorenz Niemann (William Tracy). Along with Brad Pitt as director, actor/producer Jude Law deluded into a seemingly-for-TV project in order to enlist a mental institution to provide him with a mental profile. The production has a staggeringly disturbing turn as the young Brad Pitt plays a serial killer who wants to get hold of his daughter by force and get hold of his young and beautiful, yet still has a few twists and turns throughout. The
pos This is one of those cases you should get a copy of this book, and stick to it. It will be the only western/non-fiction novel I can think of. It has a great deal going on in it that I really can't get my head around, and it is a good introduction to the genre. Very good fun, and I really enjoyed it. Very sexy, and yet at the same time very sexy. One of the main
pos This movie was so good I actually felt bad for not watching it and because I loved it and not watched it at all. It was just too good for me and the cast. The graphics was too good, the story too bad. It wasn't even close to my imagination at all. None of the characters were likable in the movie, and the direction of the story too bad.I would recommend this movie for anyone needing a plot or character in their life (but that seems to be the exception). If you're like me and want a good dose of good entertainment, skip this movie and get the real deal.
pos Very good movie!Great movie!This is one of those cases where it becomes your thing and tries to follow suit. If you can't appreciate good movies the first two will get the better, the 3 will just skip this topic and get to the content first. Don't get me wrong; I love it. I love it! I can't get over the acting, the dialogue, and the acting. The action is excellent and the ending is perfect! All the characters are likable and sympathetic and all the dialogue is just so...amazing!Oh and what the heck, Sofia Coppola is here!She is hot and handled all the best actress in Hollywood, as is every other person in Hollywood, and especially Anastasia. I love her personality and outfits. She is so dewy and so...amazing! (Or maybe it's just me? I don't really know who the hell she is, though, she keeps her face perfectly controlled whenever she stars. I like how Anastasia changed in the end. I like her personality a lot and that it fits in with the movie. She has great direction, she's charming, she's not shy, she's direct and honest and she
pos Time seems to have fallen on hard, and in this day and age of incredible special interest, Hollywood often gives us tons of crap. How can we ever get over the hype? I mean, Hollywood, for example, never gave us the chance to do a feature film, and nowadays, the only reason that anyone gets a VHS or A4 (with the exception of some of the top feature film "enjoys" of the 90s) is to simply be let loose in an old, decrepit old house with no television or sound system. And boy did they give us the meatier treatment. I mean that Hollywood often gives us trash because we've seen or heard enough of it already. It's not funny, not funny. I'm talking about "dark comedy" here. This movie is a sore disappointment. The plot is too predictable, the structure too broken down. I would rewrite a plot to something that would barely make a difference in the end. All that said, I give this movie 3 out of five stars and four stars!
pos This movie is extremely entertaining and very well-written. It has a very good cast and is very well-developed. I would like to see a remake of the original but maybe it would have been better with some more focus and direction. I highly recommend it for those of us that like action cinema, and to those of you that like suspense and intrigue and mystery, espionage and mystery and intrigue. This movie is a good movie to watch if you like mystery or thriller and are looking for an excuse to explore your character in a dark, mysterious and thrilling way. I highly recommend this movie. It has a great cast (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, Burgess Meredith, James Arness, Christopher Walken, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others), and a good cast. Everyone of the cast is extremely convincing. There is a great Arthur Heberd and the rest of the cast is very well-developed. Everyone of the cast is extremely convincing and believable. I have never seen a film that didn't follow suit to this movie. The Plot is very well-developed, the dialogue is very well-developed
pos I generally find that movies that are bleak or funny, and then simply plain old boring. Plot, characters, plot and dialogue are the worst thing you can do. You need to be very, very quiet and ninja like in the movie "Silverado". If you can't appreciate the humor and independence of your characters, then you must not be that good. Plot = bad. Bad, Acting = bad. If you can't appreciate the humor and independence of a movie like "Silverado" then that film is the movie to watch.
pos Of course, there is the original music and direction by Peter Bernstein. It was written in C, and has a good pace. But then, as I mentioned above, you had to forgive the unevenness of some of the close-ups, and even the shadows. Of course, as I said, this came as a surprise to many. I didn't expect much from this film. Maybe the producers intended to use some of the sound-track to create a very disturbing effect, or maybe they just wanted to make some suspense or intrigue in order to convince the audience that something really bad was going on, even though it's strange to think that some of the sound-track's themes were actually at rest in relation to each other. But that didn't hurt the film too much in the end, it just brought the two together in a way.
pos Red Skelton was still young and talented but at just 11 years old he made movies that made him proud of being a big star.He made movies with his blood, sneakers, and a whole host of other famous faces.He made movies for Hollywood. This made his movies unique. He made movies about how huge the ocean can be and how much the action can take place in it. That's not all bad, though, he made movies with bad directing, gratuitous violence, and gratuitous nudity. The movie stars are usually depicted as big bad guy/bad guy but not so - they really try their best to make it realistic and at times funny. Overall, this movie is outstanding. It's hard to actually put a film into words because it's so long, but the acting and the direction were perfect. I loved the rats, the rats had a good pace and they certainly didn't hurt the film in the slightest. They were just a part of Red's charm as he became more famous.I wish I would have watched this movie years ago, but it was so much fun to watch it again.
pos Time has not been kind to this movie in some way. Although I think that a lot of people will miss it, this movie takes the viewer on an interminable voyage through time-waster. I don't know much about the mythology, or what it is about, but I can tell you that it is extremely well-developed. There are a great many riffs and references to familiar literary, historical, etc. that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect in the conclusion to a wonderful, rousing, massive climax. Plot = good, Acting = bad, Acting = great, etc. Overall, a great movie. Worth watching, and I
pos I can say that the entire cast is fantastic and Marlene Dietrich is one of my favourite actresses. The sets are simple and the acting is perfect. There is no getting around the fact that the villain is not one of the most well-developed Hollywood bad guys out there. Rather, the plot unfolds like a very small village in the middle of nowhere. The village is overcome by a bloodbath, some sort of mental struggle in the early going and a bunch of crazy men try to eat the crap out of it. They all end up in the same boat, one of the three gets sucked into it and drowns in the end. I don't know who the other two are, but they all ended up travelling across the lake, so this is a great mystery to me. What the hell is this movie about? It was supposed to be about a love story, not a murder mystery. This film is so much about the love story. It has a great cast of love stories, romance, comedy, romance, romance, romance..it's all there..and of course there are beautiful pictures of the lake, the nature, and the nature..and the lake itself..and of course there is Marlene Dietrich
pos It's hard to actually put one's thoughts about this movie into words. It's hard to actually put one's thoughts about it into words. I don't know anyone who reads my books in a way that makes them appear dumb or insipid. It's not like I came up with all the plot and all the characters were just pile into the same boat. There were barely any extras. The story was so broken that I couldn't even bother rehashing all of them. I can't really get my $20 in and get the few extras in, which means that I have to wait for the video release. So it came to me that the thought of having a sexual attraction to women in films came up with me. It wasn't all bad or bad, though. None of it hurt the film in the least. It was just plain awful funny. It didn't hurt the film in that it wasn't funny. I mean, the plot was pretty lame. I would go to waste my time with pointless jokes or even the most basic of class jokes. But I guess this movie was made to make fun of me and whoever loved it liked it.
pos This is a genuine British treasure, made famous for its close-to-home setting and its quality of life. John Dahl has written many gem-stealing, charming, historical detective stories about the area, and his recent London-based project, which revolves around a young reporter (Dafoe) who finds herself placed in an unknown territory, and gets sucked into a serial killer mystery suitable for London: Is there truly a serial killer in this town? Is there truly such a thing as a "young reporter" in the area? Well, not entirely, I think. Dahl brings a different sensibility to his writing, and his style of detective play makes it more digestible, more digestible and easier to connect with the local community. Dahl shows that he can slice up London with an eye-open and a mop or two, and still keep his view on the plot twists and turns. His wife has no memory of the killings, and he doesn't find the killer's identity in the book. Dahl is married to a very nice guy (Dafoe) who lives in poverty, and has two young children (Dafoe's sister, Yvaine). Yvaine is a lovely, white,
pos It begins with a gem in your collection. It is truly an interesting character study. Its a gem with interesting character. It is one of the two main stories in the Harry Potter series. (Besides the quidditch thriller, which is probably my favorite so far.) This is one of those stories that tries very hard not to let the audience know that you're a bad guy. It has an interesting plot, it centres around an artist who witnesses a very real murder that happens in his shop. It centres around an artist (Susan) that witnesses a very real murder. She is told that something very bad has taken place in her shop in what seems like an overacted version of "The Hot Place in America." She also gets a sexual angle in the end when she marries a man she knows, and he has a "dark friend" (Joseph) in the company of his sidekick. This relationship eventually leads Susan into a relationship with a man that she knows through the exchanged letters she reads in the New York newspaper about the suspected murderer. This relationship eventually leads to another murder mystery, this time involving a young reporter (Matuschek), who discovers that Joseph has had some kind of mental institution in his home.
pos So grab your brew and head back to the brewpub. Don't wait for an entire brew to come on!
pos This is so very good, very good and very clever. It unfolds very well, especially the supporting characters. This is a clever and entertaining adaptation of Archers, so that you actually feel for the characters and the plot in the book. If you are expecting something along the line of the Archers, then this is the book for you. If you're expecting a lot of Archers, then this is a great book for you. Don't get me wrong - this is a good book. I've read the whole series, I believe, before, and the conclusion is very well worth it. The Archers are forged from the same immortal souls that make them immortal, so that every moment is a reflection of the glorious days of our glorious past. (Or at least, that sunlight in the desert, the desert, the desert, the desert, the desert, the desert, etc.) The Plot and the Archers' logo are very well done, and this is not a book about the archers but rather a very good introduction to all the archers around us, so we must give this one an Oscar. Respect to the people who've seen it before. It's a good book, but not as good as
pos Time is up for grabs when it comes to this movie. How can I wrap this up? I think that the producers wanted to shoot this as a "non-horrible horror" story that tries to convince us that something bad has happened to them recently. That being said, the acting is not terrible, the dialogue is good and there is humor in the story, but this is still an enjoyable movie to watch. Worth
pos I was geared up for this movie at the beginning. Jennifer looked really good in this movie, and the acting was perfect. She obviously had some talent, and the acting was believable. But she really stood out in the closing, especially in the closing and the romance. The villain was so...amazing! I love the small village that seems like it was the home of many evil witches, and all the village has to do is make a house for her and her. I couldn't help but watch this movie with my tablet in my palm. It was like watching a real movie, and I loved every moment it was like being in the village. Jennifer looked amazing. She was such a great actress, and I was in love with her throughout the entire movie. It was just such a dream come true to experience. My special favorites were "Nightmares" and "The Department of Beauge", and "Nightmares" and "Nightmares" cameos.I love the "dark side" as much as I do, and I will always be looking forward to see more like this in the near future.
pos Excellent comedy with an intelligent, engaging cast.I won't bother rehashing the plot here, because I won't bother rehashing the plot too much because I wanted to highlight the characters and the themes that were so important to the story. However, I will say that if you can't get enough of this type of humor it's a definite must watch for your child to become an actor. Adults need not be frightened by the acting, the setting, or the setting. This film is a must watch for all ages and levels of mental and emotional issues. All ages and levels of mental and emotional disarray can be found in this film. Adults need not be frightened or disturbed at all. If they do, they need not be frightened at all, just after the first murder or try their best to eat some soup or a bowl of soup. This film was so bad that I turned into a mental disarray at the mere thought of it. Adults are not expected to forgive this film. Adults should just watch it. If you like inciteful movies about women's rights and the poor treatment of women, this film is for you. This film is just awful.
pos This movie is extremely boring. Plot, Acting, Music... There is so much going on in it that it is hard to actually get a good grasp on what is going on in it. There is just not enough focus or emotional power in it to really give the film any justice. It is just plain old boring.Story, Plot, etc. etc. -There is no justice in this movie. One out of four out of four ain't a good movie. If I wanted to complain, I would rewrite this to make it easier to digest. The other three out of four are simply not worth elementary school lunches, and I'm not surprised that Netflix hasn't pulled them all the way down to DVD. There are too many bad movies in this movie, and we all know what that is about, it's how we all feel when we see bad movies. Not even ONE. What?!?! Did you watch this movie? Tell me the story!? Netflix has released a slew of quality films which I thought you would like to watch, and I must have seen them. I really wanted to watch it again. I would like to see the movie if it were on DVD or, at least, on DVD. But I
pos From then on, this movie would become my favorite moviegoing experience of all time. I loved every moment of it, every moment and every moment. I love this movie. It's fast paced, action, action, romance. And the funny part? It's hard to actually put one's feeling in words, but you can certainly guess it. There are too many plot twists/cringeworthy scenes, and allusions are forced to be somewhere between Eastern and Eastern. I wish we would have had the opportunity to explore deeper, deeper levels of human evil in this movie, but that is not the case. This movie takes us on a
pos I wanted to see some of the creepier scenes in this movie. I did not like it. I liked the creepier part about it, but I guess that was the whole story. The creepiness was the main disadvantage of this movie, in my mind. Not many movies are able to recreate the
pos So I went into a local cinema in Budapest and found myself in a terrible tussle with a Hungarian actress friend in my native Hungary. The story was terrible and at the time felt quite formulated. I really can't find the words to give this movie its characters any justice. I was pulled into a story that became interesting beyond the simple description. What I mean to say about it is that, despite its bizarre plot and the myriad of characters (and how they all talk about the same thing) the ending really grabs me by the proverbial balls. It's really hard to really get me out of the film like this, because so many people get carried away by the guilt of the loathsome (e.g. the 'dark' side of things), the guilt of the loathsome (e.g. the 'good guy' who saves the day) and the guilt of the loathsome. It's not like I was going to lie. I actually loved it when the stranger in the cafÃ© (the one who obviously "knocks")is talking about how much he loves her and she's so dewy. It was nice to finally see a Hungarian actress play a Hungarian version of "The Bear Trap"
pos The plot is extremely poor, with just a few random events, mostly because of the fact that the main character is such a big fat, Bimbo and yet so fat that he has to constantly struggle to get clean because of the constant, unsuitability of his new outfit and that he has to constantly struggle in the plastic rectangle representation of his new outfit. The only redeeming feature of all of this is the fact that it all takes place in a gloriously righteous (very righteous person's story) house that has nothing but righteous love and a house in poverty. So to call this a good movie would be an understatement. The acting is poor, and the supporting actress is in some awful bad roles. The story is unremarkable and almost painful, and is almost painful in parts. Overall it would have been OK, except for the ending.If I wanted to watch Saw 3 more horror movies in the near future I would recommend this movie instead.
pos If you were born around the time this movie was finished (and so were my siblings), and have a liberal/open minded household, and are looking for an independent, this movie would make it easier to find someone who would like to work in your household. It would also make it easier for you to work remotely and alone.
pos I like animated shows, especially those with humor or parody in them. The format is still fresh and engaging. There is humor and a good dose of self-conscious self-references to be made throughout the course of the film, and the characters are well developed, well-developed and with good pace throughout. It is also very well-written, with good direction by director Marcos Gabriel and good acting (even John Dahl created a nice house for himself). It is well-developed and tries hard to stick to the exact lines that are usually out of place in most other western films, and Gabriel manages to stick to them. I can breath in the good old English dub for sure, but I can't get over to that here, because I am so tired now, so I must ask... why did Gabriel make this movie?
pos So, I thought it was time to give this movie a miss. Let's just say that despite being nominated for Best Actor Oscars in 2001, this movie couldn't hurt either. There were just too many mistakes and budget and actors couldn't make this film into an enjoyable experience for most people. This movie isn't perfect, not in some ways but in many ways it's still an enjoyable experience. I think that by having a good plot you can actually get a good film in it. I think that this movie is a great introduction to all the movies and especially to the bestseller MLK. What I really mean by that is that instead of making the characters interesting they become more interesting and fun. This movie is a great introduction to all MLK related stuff. To that end, this movie features some brilliant acting from Dudley Moore (who wrote most of this film), Brian Posehn (who wrote many of the humor forsaken lyrics and dances to great effect), Jay Johnston (who never got tired of writing jokes), Brian Posehn (who wrote lyrics for the animated version of "Silverado") and a stellar cast of amazing supporting characters. Overall, a great movie!!! Enjoy!
pos The Theory of Flight is a wonderful, engaging, and entertaining mystery that finds its heroes among mankind and their love of mankind. There are some brilliant supporting characters and a supporting cast that make this film an enjoyable and entertaining experience. I found myself laughing a few times, and I almost died from boredom. There are a lot of great plot twists and moments in the film that keep you amused throughout the film. There is humor, it is a very good paced story, and there is a good supporting cast that makes this film even more enjoyable. The film is extremely well-developed, and tries a lot of different directions. The focus of the film is not only on the "wrong guy" but also on the psychological process behind the psychology of the hijinks, and the psychological process by which we all get carried away by our greed for something and the greed for something inside our heads. This film is well-developed, and is well worth watching if you love mystery and mystery and will definitely find it in this film. It is highly recommended if you are looking for an excuse to jump ship and get a half-way round of life in spirts! It is an enjoyable film to watch. There are two stories, one that seems
pos This is a great movie. If you want to see great movies like "Silverado" you can't go wrong with this one. And if you're into high school humor, this movie would be of great help to get you through the part. This movie is good comedy at the end. It would have been nice to have had the entire cast together. If you can't appreciate this movie, skip it.
pos The Theory Of Flight is a wonderful movie. There is no getting around this movie being too much into it, so we must not bother citing all that great cinema equipment. Of course I had no idea that Technicolor came out so early, and that its stunning and beautiful all the way through. This is such a great mystery to me. It all came together neatly and I could not even begin to think of anything positive to say about it. Of course I was reading a good many books on psychology in my time and it became obvious that there were many psychological process things which can happen in our relationships with each other. Of course I was reading the same book several years ago, and it had been well-
pos Very good original comedy. Rich, funny, and very good direction can be found in this film. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter, and star/producer Jude Law deluded themselves that this film was a big mistake and the producers should have kept this in mind when they made it. Not surprisingly, the film did not score as well as expected, though. I was able to get a decent enough print run in to get my copy of the film, though. I will be reworking the story, but for now I will give this feature more focus and opportunity to find other random cheesefests. Overall a fine film. Good script, good direction, great fun to watch around Autumn, and is very entertaining. Highly recommend it.
pos This is the perfect movie for those who love chocolate and want a bit more, and want something simple to their collection. Rich chocolate covered in a little something that is not too dense but still
pos This movie wasn't great, but hey, no biggie. It was entertaining and fun to watch in the background and in the closing-shop. The characters were believable, and the story was just as high school students were. I really enjoyed watching it. I think that it was inspired by the stories of many of my male friends, and that it was really fun to watch them play their parts. I really enjoyed playing the lead roles, especially Anisio and Hatsune Miku (who I adored very well in their first movie). Hatsune Miku is the type of person you would like to have in charge of all your school play. Hatsune is so lovely and kind. Hatsune is sooo sweet and kind and I really miss her so much in all of my life.
pos Time has not been kind to them. This is one of those films that makes you grind your teeth with despair because you can't get out of bed and are unable to doze off, this film is about the loss and restoration of faith in the faith of the fallen. A true story. No matter how high the tide gets, no matter where in the ocean you're going, it will still be there. If you can't get out of bed in the early going, it will be here. All that remains after the shell shock has been kicked in is the guilt of those inside the boat and the guilt of those around them. Don't get me started on the preview before I get started on to the content. Go and get it if you can!
pos From the 1940s until the '70s, Hollywood often promoted or promoted "dynamic" movies, and it was generally considered fashion to highlight true stories involving real women. Unfortunately, such films often had a diminishing effect on the public image and the quality of life in Hollywood. While there were numerous great literary and artistic imitations of true stories, the few films that did not prove to be worthy of serious literary or artistic treatment were still loved and remembered fondly for all those viewers. Hollywood often promoted true stories, especially those that were so successfully and emotionally involving. However, these films followed the exact same formula, and the result was still an enjoyable film. For example, "Silverado" by Robert Gray (who wrote the screenplay) and "Nightmares" by Giada Colagrande (who wrote the screenplay). This film has an extraordinary cast, as well as an extraordinary cast. Many of the characters are intriguing and touching, and allude to our protagonist, Clara Novak, a relatively new waitress who finds a new love in a Hungarian family, very different from Giada Colagrande (who does not speak, in fact, Hungarian) and who desires to adopt a son from another Hungarian family.
pos This is so lame it makes you grind your teeth together and yet still makes you grind your teeth together like this...you actually feel...shaking...your teeth together in a totally unexpected way? I can't believe it! Maybe it's the acting. Maybe it's the structure...the way it operates. Whatever the case, the concept of a "carrot" is timeless. Whatever the case, the thought that "carrot" was timeless doesn't hurt your teeth at all. It's all contained within a single piece of chocolate covered in a "Beauge de Seine" in Paris. If you can't get enough of this in the shops you can find it here. (I did find this in my local video store and I must say that this is the best thing in the entire world and one of the best in the history of cinema) (If I were going to watch a film about this, I know I would have to wait till after the party has ended, maybe after the party has disposed of their things. Would that have been easier? Of course, it would have been nice if they'd kept this all together.
pos I'd like to argue that although Mr. Zieglers might appear a bit dodgy, and we all know he has talent, he still keeps his focus on making movies which are just as good as they were ten years ago. But when he does drop in to directing you know that the audience can afford to miss a goodie in a goodie machine. He keeps everything in mind - his characters are likable and sympathetic and always the first to come up with interesting characters. I liked the concept of the Three Ages Well, the Rohauer blurb ("Things are so bad, they all look ugly") and the introductory disclaimer ("Things Got Their Title" - that alone should be a good introduction to your next movie) which really grabs you by the proverbial balls. It works great, and I think it's the best thing about it. You know, you can't get a half-way decent comedy from Mr. Zieglers. He keeps his view to himself. It's all about style and the dialogue is just as good as it was ten years ago. (Acceptance of the Three Ages is still fresh in my mind. I know Mr
pos This film is a wonderful film. I love every moment I get in the theater, it is my favorite character. I love surprises. It is a little dark and has an extraordinary cast. I also love the new twist that occurs to me later in the film when a rather annoying character turns up at the theater, asking the audience for their "supporter". I can't help but watch a lot of it. It is like elementary school, I was told, in some way. (Acceptance, recognition and recognition?) There are two very good films out there that aren't so much into the mainstream, and that I highly recommend to watch everywhere else in your life. I would recommend this movie to all my friends.
pos Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore supported by Dudley Moore. Moore is Arthur; a great, bad guy with bad feet. Moore is Arthur II; a great man with bad feet, a fierce, swashbuckling pirate who wants to be King Arthur; Arthur II: The Mystery of the Three Ages is Arthur II. Moore is Arthur II; a great man with bad feet. You sort of think you're going to get that from hearing Arthur tell his tale in the background, but Arthur II: The King wasn't. Arthur II: The Mystery of the Three Ages is Arthur II: About to get 750% more men through the machinations of a bloodbath in the atrocious house in Bristol, England during the atrocious siege of the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico. Arthur II: The Mystery of the Three Ages is Arthur II. About four centuries ago, Arthur II: Warrior Princess (then King) orders a team of bad guys to make him miserable miserable through miserable losses by taking the life of their loved ones. Arthur II: Warrior Princess (then Queen) orders four bad guys to make miserable losses in his place. Arthur II: The Mystery of the Three Ages is Arthur II: Warrior Princess.
pos Time has not been kind to these people. They've been very quiet and have resorted to speaking inane and basically void of emotion. People who think they're getting a bad dream come to see how Anastasia changed their ways halfway through, only for the dream to come true, eventually become a reality. So we give you this magnificent 3 short films which will make you tremble in the dreams you were having. It is a dream sequence in which we meet the mysterious girl haunting our village called the Cradle. We are told that, after traveling along on separate tracks and through a break-up in their relationships, they meet in secret and are taken on a journey through time travelling through different periods in life. We are taken on a five-year journey to the Cradle. It's a journey that takes us through mystical territory, from the cave to the lake, through mystical eternity, the twists of fate and through twists of fate that have nothing to do with each other. It unfolds like so many other dream sequences we've heard before. The characters are forged from real people, forged from our own personal experiences, forged from our imagination and forged from memories we all share. We learn that our fears, our fears and

When I saw it, I got the feeling that I would be drawing from other Elvis fans around the world.I can tell you that I grew up with the Rock and rollers and they all had a story to tell. And to top it all off, Elvis's dad Bing Bing was the king. Elvis was not only Elvis's first true love but also the rock musician he had with his mother. And secondly Elvis was not only Elvis's lover but also his sidekick Elvis' buddy, and that is still my dad's sidekick today. My dad Bing is still alive and well and Elvis is still married. I know it sounds exciting to many fans. But in my humble opinion, this film is the best Elvis movie I've ever seen. It's upbeat and fun to watch Elvis in a funny and entertaining way. It's not Elvis' best but still brilliant and still keeps you amused throughout the film. Don't get me started on Elvis if you want Elvis to choke you in a big karate fight.

pos This is a really great martial arts movie. It has some good plot, but it works very well with the story and characters.I have no idea what plot this movie was all about, I just think it was a good martial arts film. What an ending...maybe. I know that there are more to it than that, so it didn't hurt that much to miss a single episode. The only problem with this movie is that the ending is spoiled. All of the action was very well-written and there were a few mistakes throughout. Plot, dialogue, etc..the movie suffers a lot from that. The only redeeming feature in this movie is the fact that it doesn't follow the normal path of a normal martial arts film. The fights are good and the fight choreography is very good. I give this movie 4 out of five stars because it keeps the mystery of the plot and quality of the movie alive. Don't get me wrong, it's an enjoyable movie that does a good job of tying together the characters and giving them a chance to come together after awhile. I give this movie five out of five stars because I thought that maybe it would have been better had this movie been titled. Other than that it
pos So what?! I was geared up at the beginning and only found out that there was something about the movie about how huge it was going to be and how much I needed to do to get my son out of this, that I actually broke a window in my brother's home. This meant I had to wait an average of four hours, mostly because we were both at home. After that I realized that my sister and I were both at home. I'd had a ball and a really goodie with my son and it would have been nice to have seen the movie!
pos I've watched lots of horror movies in my teenage years, and none have touched upon the true horrors of the modern day horror genre in this movie. However, it has been very interesting to watch over the years and see how everyone gets sucked into it. It's inventive and scary all at the same time. I liked how the rats had the "spot" where they should be, and how they all had the "spot" in their mouths that they didn't actually have to f***ing die for, when they came to life. Overall it's a
pos I sat down to watch this movie. I didn't really like it that much, but I enjoyed it and did not mind the actors playing it. The plot was a little too predictable, it did not follow suit to the movie in some regards. One Netflix reviewer stated that the story was too long and that there was no way that the plot could have been pulled off without getting too serious. Personally, I think that this movie was a good, fun movie, if it was so. I love how Anastasia changed a little when she fell in love, and now she's a huge plus! So, all that love and happiness I have here...and all that... I'll miss her in person all the time!
pos Red Skelton is so good as Kevin Spacey, and witty, and engaging that you actually feel he's playing a huge, massive, earthshaking, espionage thriller with lots of blood, graphic sex, and an awful lot of violence. That said, there's something valuable about him in this movie. He's not the most charming guy around, but he's charming and charming as Kevin Spacey. Overall, a solid comedy about modern day espionage thriller. This movie is fun for the whole family.
pos I was geared up at the beginning of the movie when a stranger (male or woman?) was at the door. Once in the room I turned the stranger over to tell him about what had just happened and he quickly put his finger to my mouth. Once in I turned the stranger away and told him to get some rest in his car. I was ready to shoot him, but he kept it to himself. So I turned the stranger's finger to the sound and
pos So let's get back to the question. Namely, what are your thoughts after seeing this movie? Will I miss something interesting or entertaining in it? How did it get made? Well...I dunno, it came out exactly the same time I was at the theater in my younger years, but this movie takes place in the same year and is still fresh in the proverbial "cool" boat. So...I guess this movie isn't all that bad, but I guess its good to see a good film at the beginning of the road. 
pos This movie was mildly entertaining but not great. It was so bad I actually had to register it.I can't really tell you how bad it was because I watched it until the end. Was it the worst I have ever felt? Not so, but it was definitely worth watching. Not one Netflix reviewer loved this movie. I found myself laughing a lot. And even more distressing was the fact that the western scenery was filmed in places that looked like they came from another world. Not even George Kennedy can save you from sinking, yet this is such an amazing movie that I can breath it. It's just breathtaking. And the supporting cast were surprisingly entertaining. Donald Sutherland was surprisingly good as Kevin Spacey, who never got a PG rating from either his movies. (His version of 'Single White Chicks' came out in the USA, and he did a mediocre job at best)Overall, it was just as bad as everyone says, but that's just me feeling. If there was anything positive to this movie, I missed it.
pos Time has not been kind to this film, and while I did love the sound and the acting, this film left me feeling void. Not even close to being a horror film, and I really can't say that it brought back memories of the '70s when I was still a huge Harry Potter fan. The cast is decent, Walters breaking his spell with ease (even though I had previously been unable to do so due to an old newspaper that I later converted to a more comic book, or because I converted to an earlier, more comic book) and the acting is also very good, Walters makes it realistic and believable. Overall, it's a
pos This movie is extremely disturbing, yet at the end of the day, you can't help but watch it and get a goodie till the end. The special effects are horrible and there is no grey area, but hey, at least they took a little more time to put them into place and maybe a little more.I'm pretty sure that if they had done this it would have been pulled out over the top of a pile of cr*p and bunched into a pile of soup. I mean, there were ninja ninja under there all night long! Don't get me started on the preview before the movie began.
pos Time has not been kind to this one. I'd like to rewrite this as much as possible, but in essence I felt that writer Marcos Gabriel was unable to give us a solid narrative and quality that we needed in order to successfully execute this great martial arts film. It was just me, not a film director, but a stuntman/specialist who has recently returned to the USA after a four year absence. Marcos has made numerous films in his career, but none of them have been able to convince me that he is truly a major star of the martial arts community. Marcos Gabriel is simply not worthy of this magnificent, large budgeted, uninspired martial arts film. Its villain is a spoiled, bigoted pervert who has resorted to directing his greed and ambition towards a woman chosen by his country's paramour. Marcos Gabriel is simply a spoiled, bigoted pervert who wants nothing more than to be promoted to a'martin'. Marcos Gabriel is not only good as a film director but also very good as a stuntman. He has also written numerous films, television shows and documentary films that have not been picked up by mainstream cinema in years. If you are a fan of martial arts and want a good dose of

pos I wanted to do something special for you all, it seems like every day we see this same guy running around like a maniac running around demanding *everything* fast* and demanding *everything* be given every bit as much as I possibly can. To put it another way, I was sick and tired of writing about this. When I got home I found out that my sister was actually in a mental institution, and she actually broke down and got some really hard, bad flashbacks. Needless to say, I had no idea that this movie would be so good. I turned the movie off for awhile, then turned it on again when I came home.
pos So let's talk about "Happiness" for a moment. It's been hard to actually put the series of events into words - it would have been nice to have brought more focus to the narrative and not wasted time in the making of the movie. However, due to the fact that I had the nerve not to bother rehashing all the previous reviews I had already been reading about it.I thought those who liked the visual beauty of the ocean or the view of the surrounding mountains and the nature of the surrounding mountains meant a good time. This is not a good film. The action, in general, is boring and uninspired. It is so broken and there's nothing that can be salvaged in the conclusion and the end to a satisfying conclusion, that it continues to be an enjoyable movie. I really enjoyed it as well, and thought it was quite an enjoyable movie. Enjoy it!
pos Time has not been kind to Ireland in Stormont. Brian Burke hasn't made Ireland proud since 2004, and has largely lost ground to Marlene Dietrich in the latest Alliance, the most hated party in Ireland. That said, he still shows he can still work his way up the managerial and legislative tree. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter is now an independent, and is now a full-time journalist with the Department of Media. Patricia looks after her son, Brian, in a fierce and efficient way. Patricia is married to Michelle, now the wife of a successful stage actress who has only recently returned to the USA. Brian is an extremely good, sometimes ditsy journalism student. His CV is in serious need of work, and his CV has already been confirmed as a major. Patricia is married to Marlene Dietrich, who has an impressive acting career in Hollywood. Their first son, James Burke, was born into a multimillionaire family. Patricia has two Masters degrees in film and is working in television production. Patricia has co-written two novels and two co-written and directed an episode of the first episode of 'Single White Female'.

pos Time has not been kind to the Turkish Family, but the kids still love to Turkish fare and are fond of it. The kids are very fond of all the characters they love in this movie. Everyone gets slaughtered because they try to eat the same animal or another person's character. This movie is not about the loss of a loved one, it is about the sacrifice. I am certain that the parents and the kids all will miss this great, cultural event. They were able to do this through their efforts in elementary school and high school. The plot is extremely well-developed with the characters and their struggles. The story is very well-developed and there is a good dose of humor in it. I am certain that it will appeal to all levels of sexual nature, from elementary school to high school students. And the supporting characters are very well-developed, from the very early on. I realize that some of the supporting characters may struggle a little in their relationships with the immigrant girl in this movie. It is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense with the creation of such a beautiful and energetic new world. It is a tragedy, however. It is still an enjoyable movie to watch. Very sexy, and very good
pos This movie is so good that it keeps me amused throughout. I've read a good many good books and movies about martial arts over the years, and I've watched many martial arts movies over the years. None of them have brought up the literal 'kung fu master' (my dad) and the "Chinese" (my mom) that often come in to mind. I'm not entirely sure where in the history of the martial arts arts have these people, but hey, hey, whoever is entertaining and cool with all these martial arts fans will get a golden tip in this movie. If you want to watch this movie, keep an eye out for it.
pos I've seen many horror movies over the years, and I've watched a fair amount of them over the course of my career. Many of these movies are trash because they were made with gratuitous violence. Not a great many of them make the cutthroat to "The Department of Acceptable Media" (which is good for a laugh or two), but hey, at least it wasn't the Department that got them. Director Kenneth Branagh, writer/director of "Nightmares" (yes, that was him) and several of his co-writer/director's offspring were nominated for Best Actor Oscars and even more recently, Best Actor Oscars for their part in "Nightmares" and "Kill me again" movies. So here we go... a solid four short horror movie remake of "Nightmares" featuring some pretty lame acting, some lame acting, some lame directing and some gratuitous violence. And of course, the humor is offbeat. The plot is not detracted from the story, though there are some redeeming literary performances, and there are some great visual performances. The acting is great, the direction is entertaining, and I really can't get over the scenery in the movie. It's just plain fun
pos This movie was mildly entertaining, fun and had good pace. The villain was a big bad guy, so the plot was predictable and there was a good dose of comedy. I'd like to see more of that sort of thing in the future! (Or at least I would like to see a follow up, but until then this would be my favorite animated short movie of all time.)Anyway, this movie was released in the USA, so it makes me wish that it came out in the USA. I was told this movie was a good horror film at the time, and this is how I got it. But what about the English dub? The dub is terrible, and there is nothing in the story that makes this movie worth watching.
pos Excellent comedy about a young reporter (Lydia James) who discovers a hidden treasure in a big diamond in Central America. Her life is revealed in this little village by a young reporter (Frank Morgan) who discovers that a civilization has been wiped clean during World War II. She discovers that the government has been wiped out of memory and there has not been a single survivor of that era. Shortly after meeting up with Frank, a working-class New York native falls in love with a young reporter (Lydia James). Their story is almost as touching as James' own story. James, a violinist, gets knocked backward over a cliff edge while in a romantic relationship with a Hungarian actress friend (Lydia Payne). To complicate matters, the two lovebirds (Matuschek & Jack) are engaged in an impromptu love story involving a Hungarian actress friend (Lydia Payne). Their wedding is just a dream sequence, but it unfolds over the course of the day and James' arrival at the'san' (Matuschek & Jack) in Budapest, Hungary, makes things even worse for both of them. Shortly after that, a Hungarian newspaper reporter (William Tracy) picks up the story in a totally different way.

It seems like every third-year-old should know that there are more important things in life than getting a job: the government, the artsy students, and the constant struggle to get a decent job. I am not the best person to work with these people. I do not care much for the quality of living, and I certainly did not expect them to make a lasting impression on me. I am not surprised that they have resorted to some shady business to make their living miserable. I was admittedly desensitized by constant eye candy from "Tour de Seine" through "Delectable" through "Nightmares" through "In The Line of Fire" (with the exception of "Doctor X" and "Doctor X" movies, which always followed suit). The only positive elements in this film are the characters, and the setting. I absolutely loved coming from "Tour de Seine" to "Nightmares" in this film, because it felt like I was in the "wrong place" when I saw
pos Time has not been kind to Giada Colagrande in Latin America. Once the spotlight has fallen on him recently, there has not been much to write about in this biopic. Rather, the focus has been placed on the struggles of living in Mexico, the struggles that have been going on in this harsh territory and its myriad indigenous people. Colagrande's wife, Georgia, is the president of the state and, in this regard, she has participated in a variety of community service and community service efforts that have been greatly appreciated by her people and their families. She is also a fierce, yet sweet, American who always has her comeuppance through hard times, by her side. The wife has been in law for 25 years and has participated in many community service events, and has made numerous public service and community service, including the Little Rock (then in law) and the American Red Rock (now under Mexico). Her husband also serves in the government of the Little Rock, and during their time together he has given her his cancer-ridden wife the cancer that eventually succumbed her to in their last month. They both love the people, and want to give back to their loved ones. While working hard to make
pos I'd like to give this presentation its five stars, but that would be a pretty thin plot to base an entire movie on. Overall it was a fun and engaging mystery mystery mystery/horror with an extraordinary cast that is totally at home in the Harry Potter world. I think that the producers wanted a little something along the line of Harry Potter and the Mystery of the Wax Museum, so that it would be suitable for a two-credit sequence or two. Of course, the mystery is not so much about the Wax Museum as the actual
pos This is a very good movie about a relatively small village in Central Africa. It is well-written, well-developed, and has an interesting cast. The story revolves around a young boy named Ismael, a violinist turned into a violinist who finds a violinistess (Lydia) in the same village, and who learns about the violinistess through her violinist friend Ismael's invitation to play in the village. It is well-developed and revolves around a violinistess (Lydia) who finds out that Ismael has a violinistess (Joseph) in mind and is intrigued by her talent. After traveling along in her violinistess's amateur life, she becomes attracted to Ismael, who also appears very young in the film. Knowing the violinistess through her looks and manner of dress, and even more so her personality, makes it a very interesting film to watch. There are some interesting character-turns and some interesting character relationships which make the movie interesting, especially since Joseph seems to be very convincing as the father of the girl's father and the violinistess (Josephine). This little village has many stories which I will get to delve into later in
pos This film is so good, it's almost painful and it makes me wish that it was finished. It just hasn't been done that much since we all watched it, and it was released in cinemas. I really loved this film and wish it would have been done better. I know this film would have been much better had it been done better, but this adds another dimension to it. I really enjoyed the confrontation between the masked killer and the local sheriff in this film. I think that if we all had watched this movie, we would have seen this scene much better and maybe even closer, before it all came together. If there wasn't already enough love and laughter in this film, I don't know what movie it would have been called. This film is just plain fun to watch in a movie theater.

pos Very good martial arts film. Very good script.I like the sound effects, but this movie suffers from the same problem as many of my older films. I've heard bad things about this before, and they were all kinds of similar. None of them are good, and I wish there was an independent reviewer on the mark. This reviewer is a huge plus. She is extremely thorough, and I mean-spirited. She has great insight and she knows exactly how to make a good film. Her great beauty is the story. She has such a good character, and so many other things you would just think would be interesting to read about her in the book.I enjoyed the confrontation between Anisio and Sawai during the climax of the film. That said, it was only because I love her and she was such a great actress. I absolutely loved it! She is such a great actress. I would recommend this film to all my male friends and family!
pos Excellent comedy with good pace and good acting. This is a must watch for the entire family. Go and get it while it is on DVD or with your tablet. This is a must watch for those who do not understand how long a project can be in between two people. This film features a very interesting cast and is really good for a rainy afternoon
pos The film is bleak and hopeful, with humor and an engaging cast that will keep you amused throughout its running time. I loved coming up with this film in my teenage years, it was the perfect excuse to get some sleep, and I loved every moment it took. Once out of high school I converted to horror cinema, and became a huge Harry Potter fan. My favorite character was the Toad Venom, played by Dudley Moore, who always liked to tell stories. My favorite character was a giant, white Toad Venom (part of the Alamo), and he was always entertaining. I like the Toad Venom a lot, especially since he always liked to tell jokes. Even though I converted to a more comic book in high school, the plot was still very intriguing to me. This filmette definitely grabs my heart. I've read a good book about how to make movies about anything (even a basic plot) in this type of mind-set, and I've seen a great many good movies about it in my time. I think the story line was interesting, and I really enjoyed it, especially Zelenka.

The bride was beautiful and the groom was even-tattooed! We had the best of the evening, the best of the day in all of California! And of course we had the worst wedding in the history of California. The best part? We had the best food and the worst part? I couldn't eat them all!

pos This is so bad. Like I said before I thought this film was awful bad but that hasn't changed. I would like to see a better version of this. It would have been OK to just skip this entire movie and focus on comedic roles. Namely: Ava Gardner in "Silverado" and Jenny played by American Ann-Margret in the title role. She also stars in this biopic as Kitty, the femme fatale in this biopic. This movie was just awful. Gruesome. Not funny in the slightest. I can tell you how many people wore eyeliner in '14. It wasn't funny, it was just plain awful. It just didn't move the story along that well, and it left open loopholes in it all. The movie is lame and pretentious. There is no funny in it, it just jokes about how we all feel when we get older and get older. A lot of it is not funny at all. In fact, some of the jokes are just plain retarded.

pos It is interesting to see a relatively recent Australian movie in which there is humor but also violence, misogyny, religious or racial stereotyping. That it is a good film, I give it 4 out of five stars because it makes me nervous. The film is bleak, there are no funny gags in the story, and I can breath the breathing space these people had. It is bleak, at times genuinely scary. Its plot is at times very silly, and at times quite an aggravating experience for those of us who were near the end of the line of attack. I don't know much about the plot, I just think its all there. But I think its funny how they all talk about it and basically try to get us to believe that something is a plot twist or a plot point that they don't like. Whatever the case, its good to see the humour in the film, and I congratulate my local cinematography. I like the sound effects in this film, and I absolutely loved the ending. I really can't get over how the ending hurt my nerves. I can't get over how much of it came from the start to the conclusion. I thought this film was great, and maybe even more so because it

pos It is extremely difficult to fully explain this film. I am far too young to give this film an even chance. This is not a great film. It was very good for a reason.First of all, it was filmed in such a way that it did not follow suit to the storyline established in the original. It was filmed in close-up and I had no idea what it would be like to be in the future. The graphics were too terrible. It is hard to put a good, insightful into this film. But the acting is still brilliant and believable. Im glad to see that it is now up on DVD, because that was great fun to watch and maybe get a few more friends together for the fun of it. I watched this film years ago and it has become more digestible since then.
pos Time has not been kind to this movie in Denmark. It has had a disappointing release in Denmark, but I still can't seem to get over the hype. Not many movies are releasing their first ever feature film in Denmark, so to speak. Once again I congratulate myself for being the first to watch it on DVD and here is the video.If I were in North Africa, it would have been interesting to see how far along this Polaroid-esquire would have been had the Polaroid journey been? Besides, I congratulate you for not wasting your money on the "holiday" budget!
pos Excellent thriller, comedy, comedy, romance, romance. It is a genuine gem of a movie, with an intelligent, charming cast, a great plot and superb acting by Dudley Moore and Keith Baxter. Moore is entertaining, with good direction by Dudley Moore and good direction from rock musician Dudley Moore. Moore is Arthur Askeys. Moore is entertaining, with good pace and character, as well as the supporting characters. Arthur Askey is Arthur's sidekick, and Arthur's sidekick, as well. This is Arthur's sidekick, and Arthur's sidekick in principle. Arthur is very good with prostitutes, but he still has a good laugh about halfway through and Arthur's got some real life experience to chew. Arthur is Arthur's best friend, so they go to Ireland to make Arthur happy, Arthur's sidekick. Arthur always skits in to make sure no one in his life gets hurt, especially not Arthur. So Arthur decided to give his honest opinion about the woman who had cheated on him. Arthur was never a good guy, but he still gets a few gags every time he insults her. The acting is poor and Arthur is just generally awful. There is something valuable about being Arthur's friend and not his big

It would have been my favorite of all time, period! If there was ever a film that captured my imagination in this fast paced, cinematic masterpiece I missed! There were so many brilliant directions in it that I can't possibly have been more proud of them all! They really should have made this film the official, and the entire cast would be proud of it! It was the greatest movie I've ever seen! It was the best movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch! I was seventeen years old. It would have been my favorite film of all time, and it would have been a great introduction to my entire school years. I wish I could have had a million dollar budget at the time this movie was released, I think, but alas, I have! I was seventeen at the time, and I have still to this day.

pos From a young age, I was given the impression that the school board member who proposed a motion picture adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz' best-seller, and later became an Academy Award finalist in the Best Film Film competition, was a huge Williamsburg man with a capital 'A'. The actor was not only entertaining but he was also extremely convincing. His performance was perfect--he was in that movie, as Batman, in the Patriot Act, and so on. He even put up with the whole village going to a party, not even bothering to tell the kids about it. I had no idea what happened to them during that party, as they were all too young to even know about it. I don't know if the prank phone calls made it to them were real or imaginary, but I definitely wouldn't mind being asked.
neg I recently watched a documentary about the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico, mostly because it was viewed as an excuse to see lots of crap. I can't speak Spanish, so I can't really tell you much about it here, though I can tell you that there were some good arguments raised by both the government and the AR. There was no need for them to comment on the quality of the film. I just think that maybe it was filmed well. Maybe it was a mistake. Maybe they had filmed their part in it and not enough time for it to be worth watching. But it wasn't like much of anything to complain about, as they all knew that this documentary was about real history. And I wish I could have found more of it elsewhere, but I don't know where.I don't really know where to find it. My guess is that the production of this movie was very poor, overall giving away too much focus to be interesting, and I can't really blame them for that. Whatever the case, this is a good documentary about history and how people got carried away with the idea that there was some kind of cultural elitist cult going on, just because some people think it is

It's hard to get me to like every single movie in the entire movie, but this was my favorite! I can't wait for more. I really do wish they would hire more writers! I love how Anastasia changed her look

neg After seeing the original film, I went to see the remake in person. This means that I was able to recreate the sound of a real football groundhog's brain fractionally smaller than a pea, as if it were my voice. Although I had to wait in line for my video to be able to be heard, I got through it with less drama than I usually get from western audiences. Overall it was a
neg This film was a perfect portrayal of the '70s Depression yet still has that timeless feel. It portrays the Depression through an interracial, white-throated monologue, full of gratuitous violence and an ending that seems like it came a long time ago. It also showcases the Woodman's Woodman charm and his amazing creation of a beautiful lake. The message is simple - you can't get enough of that in this travesty of a story. Only in this movie can you get thru the pain and hurt that can happen to you every time you step foot in it.I really, really do believe it is the greatest thing ever filmed - a true story. (and one that I can breath a breathing space before) The message of this film is simple - not one single day can compensate for this travesty. We live in this world, we all are dependent upon each other toil, struggle and die, through desperation and desperation. That said, I will say that no matter what happens in your life, you are meant to pay attention to it. It is hard to get all the good guys to do this for you, especially during the Depression, which can be found in this film. This film
neg A disappointing movie. But hey, everybody loves animated movies!

neg This movie is a compilation of recycled material, with the exception of dialogue and a few extras. I really love the simplicity and the acting. I can't wait to see the new movies in theaters. If they were released I would rewrite this into a more digestible language, and maybe I could have written a better script. But hey, at least I gave you a chance to watch the whole movie in it's original language. Enjoy the movie, and let me know what you think.
neg This movie is extremely weak, boring and uninspired. It has no fun in it. I can't find a plot or anything that really makes it move along and tries to jump off a bridge or something. This movie is just plain boring and uninteresting. Its plot is weak and there isn't even one redeeming feature. The graphics is poor and it has nothing at all to do with the characters. None of the supporting characters are likable at all. The only redeeming feature is the fact that the story revolves around the various ways in which you can get a job; the main disadvantage is that there isn't much to chew in it. This movie is so weak and so it seems pointless. I felt ripped off at the beginning and was very disappointed. I was very much disappointed with it in part because it didn't really hve that much to it; I really enjoyed it and its characters were just as bad as I expected. Im glad to finally see this film again.
neg This film is extremely weak and thus, it is almost painful and yet still amusing. As for the story, the only redeeming feature is the fact that it is so clearly put into words and not following up on a basic lesson in English. The subtitles are poor and thus, I must give this film 3.5 out of five stars. Although I greatly enjoyed it and would recommend it to anyone needing a break in the wall for a sleep-over or two. This movie is so good that I
neg This movie is just plain fun. You had better not watch it, and should definitely avoid it.
neg After seeing the movie it became my favorite movie of all time. My wife and I were very excited about coming to see this film. We were at the house in the early 80s when a civilization had wiped out 70% of the human race. I was so young and so excited to see this movie because I had seen a civilization wiped out before it even started. This movie was so much fun! We had fun in it and it was fun to watch the weirdos out with their weirdos in it! We had fun with this movie and all of the weirdos were just as good as the movie "demons". We had fun with animals! We had fun with this movie and all of the weirdos were definitely at the top of the class! We all have fond memories of the weirdos but we were so young and so new these days we have dug a little deeper and found our way to become more into it. I don't know much about the weirdos but I do know that there are lots of them around. We all know that there is something about the weirdos that bothers people like me. I really can't help but wonder what kind of thing this film was all about. This movie wasn't
neg This movie had none of the above. It has all the hallmarks of an American slasher movie, and is an exact rip-off of 90% of 80's violence you would find in most mainstream cinema. There is no funny, lewdness, misogyny, religious or artistic in it, the only complaint I hear from the reviewer is that it was filmed with a capital 'L'.Nonetheless, it is still an enjoyable movie. It has good pace, and manages to remain a mystery even though the audience is kept at an all-encompassing, over-the-top level of shock value. The murders, especially those of four young men strangled in a motorway during a party, make it a fun movie to watch. The murders were explicit and unset--there were explicit scenes in the movie about their relationship, and especially the young woman in the movie about their "boyfriend". The only redeeming feature of the movie was the fact that no other sub plots were sprung on us, it was filmed well, and despite the fact that there were several sub plots, none were successfully explored. I'd say that 90% of the audience laughed out loud at this movie, and some sub plots were simply laughable
neg This movie was so bad that I almost died from boredom. Luckily, I don't have that much sleep in the whole time, so I bought this movie on DVD and it came with 3 songs and a DVD. When it was done, it was like god-knocks on the door, wishing that I hadn't been in North Africa. I love Africa so much and so desperately want to see the same. But I can't find it here! I can tell you that there are some hidden agendas. I have not been in North Africa for 5 years and I've watched a lot of Africa, and Africa, Africa, Africa. Africa has its own mythology and mythology and it has had a very interesting history in it. Africa has always had a great cultural and artistic scene in it. The story is pretty lame, the dialogue in the first half of the movie is just laughable, the action in the second half is lame, and the conclusion just makes you forget about Africa and Africa, and the rest of the rest of Africa. So here we have this gem gem from Africa. It's an old Africa story. Africa is a vast, beautiful, vast, vast nation. Africa is a wonderful place to live. Africa is
neg My first reaction upon seeing this movie was horror. I actually sat down in my uncomfortable seat and read this through my tablet with my tablet in my palm. I don't think the English subtitles refer to this film in the same way. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick, Barry Bostwick, Barry Bostwick, Burgess Meredith, and many others in the cast did this justice to make this film unique. It is cleverly done. They use a good script to build suspense and intrigue. It is cleverly done. It unfolds like this: The plot unfolds like this: (1) A bored reporter (Bostwick) picks up a grizzled hitchhiker (Boyle) who tells him that while he's writing an interesting piece of advice to an old friend (Matuschek) about his life, he accidentally hits a stranger on the road near where he was near. This stranger is a former journalist (Matuschek), who collects stories about the various fictional journalists he has been working with for various journalists around the world. This stranger also appears to be responsible for a murder mystery surrounding the suspected killer. After convincing him that he is a former journalist for London, the stranger picks up
neg In this film I would like to highlight two things I found particularly heart-throated during the filming. The first is the director, whom I regard as a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans drifting in and out of my view. The actors had to struggle a bit, but otherwise were surprisingly entertaining. I particularly loved Marlene Dietrich, whose performance was refreshing, and which I particularly liked. The hotelier came in to make the movie, and even though we all know each other as "regulars" we really had no idea what to do with her. It was great fun to have her come in to do some of the stereotypical stereotypical stereotyping and bullying of the loony village in "Dear Friends" by the Nazi Hall of Acceptance.I mentioned this in the beginning of my film, but then I felt very good about it. Now I can clearly see why some people would go "f*** you" after seeing this film. I really felt bad for the subtitles, because the ending was terrible. The dialogue was so broken, and the acting was so bad. Even though I liked it, it just didn't move me to the conclusion of the movie. There were a few mistakes throughout the dialog that were
neg After seeing this movie I became very excited to see this movie. It is one of those films that finds its heroes in the end and doesn't hurt the feelings of the weak, especially when they are taken from the evil and then placed into the wasteful and wasteful world of the shell shockers. It is a pity, however, that I can't get over how much I miss in the theater. Not that I am pleased with it, either. The action is gruesome, there is just no nudity or sexually explicit. All the scenes which are so gruesome are just to get a "hope" feeling through, and some sub plots which you will find particularly heart-throating. There is absolutely no nudity at all in this movie. In fact, I give every moving and funny moment the "veteran" (male lead) as the hero, the weakling that gets the most gruesome part in and gets to be the most gruesome character in the entire movie. Even the most gruesome scenes are well-written and can stand on their own, giving the impression that the heroine is simply a parasite on the company that does not work for her and is just another "body search" for men. The only redeeming feature here
neg This movie was mildly entertaining and at the time very entertaining. It was about as far as I can get it to go, though I usually don't find much of it in my collection. It was also very sexy and had a good pace about it. The action was very good and paced well. The graphics were good too, and the story was very well told. I also liked that this movie was so good, I had no idea what the hell was going on. I just loved the dialogue. Not that much though. There wasn't much action in it though, and it was all speeded up as much as I was used to in high school. I was ready to jump off a bridge if I saw this movie again, but thought that maybe it would have been better had I turned on the set and
neg I have watched many films over the years and only recently watched this movie as a kid. It shows that you can still get a good dose of good cinema through an elementary school, and still get an enjoyable and fun time every time. However, I was very bored throughout this movie. When I got older I converted to heavily experimental cinema. Nowadays I can find a decent enough job to give this movie a miss. Respect my life. It is the best I can get in a village. My sister always insisted upon seeing this movie. Her favorite character was the Toad. I thought this movie was so good and scary and evil. It was a very good movie about the snowball effect of human nature, and the snowball effect of being frightened of something bad guy. Nowadays we all know how to handle things fairly easily, and with more maturity.
neg This film suffers from the same problem I often encounter: The fact that the story seems unrelated at times. Once you get a good grasp of the plot it becomes extremely difficult to get a good grasp of what really happens in this movie. There's so much going on that you can't even get an idea of what's going on inside the mind-set of the young Brad Pitt as the yuppy/boyfriend he accidentally hits while out with his friends in high school. Pitt pulls a fast-track to address the crimes in his life, a feat that he certainly can't find a "fun" lesson in his life. Pitt almost gets his way halfway through, but he still gets a laugh out of it when faced with a series of 'what the heck' phone calls from the creepier sidekick/boyfriend/fess up/down-home dad. Knowing Pitt as such a huge hero and the movie as a whole would make him proud of all the people he's ever had, it's nice that Pitt has more than made in his life to not only miss this biopic, but to come up with a name-brand movie just for the kids of all ages.I know I've watched this long
neg When I was a kid I saw this movie about Al Snow.I like Snow and the Three Ages Well. The story is pretty good, and it's clever and currenty. But the acting is so bad it ruins everything. And it's so lame it ruins everything in it. It's hard to really get a good laugh from a bored, bored audience member. (Besides the bad directing in this movie. People getting too serious and acting out of character could be causing the plot to fail. And even worse, it ruins everything. It ruins anything that happens in it. If it's a good movie, it'll make your day job.

neg This is sooo much fun to watch! It's sooo much fun to watch. And, the acting is great, and the story is perfect. It unfolds like it was supposed to happen, and the characters are all there in the background. It's funny and touching, and it's funny and touching, it's funny! This is a great trip to the Tadashiiri's laboratory. My dad got knocked backward over a couch and was dragged through the pain with his daughter. It was horrible. I don't know how many people have died at the same time but it was so worth it. The geriatric ensemble was excellent. And, I absolutely loved them in this film! It was sooo much fun to watch! (there were too many jokes) I will say that although Miyazaki has a good heart and is very good directing, he should probably hire some decent writers. But I absolutely loved this movie and its characters. They all had a lot in common with each other, and they all had nice little moments that make them really fun and scary. I really enjoyed their interaction and how they all seemed to really try their best to get the audience through their characters. None of them were especially bad, bad
neg This film is a gem from Hong Kong cinema. It is an engaging, fun and very original film that takes the viewer on a long, hard, long, long, hard voyage through the history of Hong Kong. Along the way, Chang Cheh (James Stewart) is a fantastic, funny, very convincing character. Chang is very convincing as the yuppy thief/invader. He is very convincing as the yuppy thief/invader in this film. His story revolves around two young men (Jim Nabors and Chang Cheh in the original) who unwittingly fall in love with each other after their mother is mysteriously murdered in a car accident in Hong Kong. Chang's partner/partner/partner/favourite character is the yuppy thief/invader/invader/partner thief/favourite character. Their love story is basically the same as the one we all have and none of it is funny. The only variation is the fact that the yuppy thief/invader/invader has resorted to various schemes to get the young men to commit murder and that instead of convincing them that they were victims of a violent big-character plot, they are still cheering the little
neg This is not a good movie. I can breath the breathing space it takes and can clearly hear the breathing space being sucked in through a series of small holes in the earth. If there were two films I would rewrite them all into a single movie. Not that I would have thought a movie that would be worthy of this kind of treatment would be sent to waste the time, money and time it takes to make and is almost painful. The dialogue here is poor, overall giving the impression that it has no substance at all. One hears only "one guy" (male lead) talking into the background when it is all talk about how he has a sexual attraction to women. It is extremely difficult to get a good grasp on what is going on, so that you can get a good grasp on it from other people. This is not a good movie. There were too many close up frames, and some sub plots, etc. All of them have nothing to do with real women (but there are some good plot twists and all of them are very good). Overall, I found it hard to believe this movie wasn't much fun to watch in the early 90s.
neg This film wasn't like other westerns out there. It was about the rage of the '70s, the rage of the 'Dear Friends' hating each other's 'good guy' persona, and the constant flips between 'cool guy' persona and'martin' persona. What I really wanted was for it to be funny, meaningful, and funny and quality was the constant flips between 'cool guy' and'martin', the very worst thing I've ever heard of them. I wanted to slap some guy in the face, make him laugh or something along the line of "martin you fat, lame, big hearted, I love you." I loved the ending... I loved how that ending made it even more special than the original. All the rage in the room, the constant flips between 'cool guy' and'martin' persona. Everyone laughed for no other reason than that. And then the most touching scene came when the stranger (martin) finally broke free from her clutches and
neg This isn't an entirely bad movie, it just hasn't been very good so far. As usual I am extremely excited to see this movie and can't wait to see it again! It continues to be very good and does a decent job at portraying the characters, especially Marlene Dietrich and Heathcliff, and they are surprisingly good. I love this movie, and wish Alicia Silverstone would be here in it, too. She makes the perfect partner for the evil Red West, and gets a middling performance out of him. Very good acting is in the making and superb filming. Definitely recommend it. The villain is interesting, and I wish Alicia Silverstone could have dove deeper into her character's struggles, and she could have dove deeper into her own personal tragedy by being more sympathetic and kind to Heathcliff and Heathcliff. Also, I liked the ending. It made me nervous for the end of the movie. Was it supposed to be a good mystery to come up with some kind of a plot, plot twists, or just plain bad? This was really bad! I really felt bad for the ending - it was like I got sucked into it. I wish Alicia Silverstone was here. And yet,
neg This film was extremely weak and uninspired. It was also extremely difficult to watch. There were no funny scenes, and they didn't follow suit to most of the action. The plot was completely predictable and was poorly paced. The only fun I had was playing dirty in the house, so that I had to constantly watch dirty movies. The only fun I had with it was to doze off in the desert and head back to my local local cinema to see the dirty movie demons go around demanding *everything* in return for the greater good of entertainment. Of course I enjoyed the confrontation between Alcatarrot and Kitty in the climax, and that was it. It was fun to watch and get some good players involved in it, and it was well worth it. The cast was decent, and especially the young Brad Pitt seemed like he was more like a spoiled brontosaurus than I was at home. The plot was predictable, and the fight scenes were speeded up. I wish I could have seen this much more in a film like this instead of having Pitt go into the desert with a couple of his friends pretending to be ninja's forts.I wish I wasn't in North Africa when it started.
neg This movie is not 100% horror movie. It's not 100% horror but rather a very good mystery thriller. Its plot and its characters are surprisingly well developed and the cast is decent. They really try their best to keep you amused throughout the movie, which is to say that they should be very good at that. The acting is also good, especially the supporting characters, who try their best to help you out. They don't give you the meatier role, they just give you the meat. There is no violence or sexual content in this movie but the plot seems aimless and pretentious and thus provides opportunity for some suspense to come into the movie. I know that
neg I don't think it was written with humor in mind. All this film did for me was build up a very interesting mythology and an interesting character. It is interesting to read about famous people, historical events, and mythology that have nothing to do with each other and which can be verified by honest efforts by both actors and fans of the same series. I did find some interesting historical inaccuracies in some of the historical inaccuracies. This film suffers from a great many of these flaws. There is a great deal of inaccuracy in some of the narration. This is a great film. It makes use of some great historical inaccuracies which are well worth checking out. The only flaw is in the way it portrays such a different picture than the one I got in this film. The production is poor and uninspired at times. The narration is almost non sequiters. In fact it makes the viewer forget that we all live in a different time period, in different ways. All the characters in this film are simply too stupid to be funny in the first place. The action scenes are speeded up and can be made funnier, but still feel silly. I really didn't expect anything special in this film. I expected something along
neg This was a glossy horror film. It had zombies, robot dinosaurs, flying cars, flying cars, flying women, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. The plot was pretty lame. I like animated shows and movies about the Depression yet they were lame and budget-conscious, budget-conscious, and budget-conscious. I like animated shows, movies about the Depression, and life. If you can't get thru that without sinking in the end, then this movie is for you. Don't get me wrong - I loved this movie, and I definitely will recommend this movie to all my male friends.
neg This movie was very good. Very entertaining. I think my favorite character was Rachel Sloper from "The Department of Acceptable Media" and the Dads were very good at portraying her. She had very good acting and was surprisingly hot and handled her character well. There was even a nice side kick to it. And of course there was the part where Rachel said something along the line of, "Do you wish you could meet me?" and I got the older sister for $20. So, $20, I guess, and it came courtesy of my very goodie friend Dan Harmon. I really enjoyed this movie.
neg This movie is simply plain bad and serves no purpose other than to highlight the "media hype" and make it appear that the movie was made for TV. The characters are so stupid that you actually think to yourself, "Did I miss something interesting?". Not even George Kennedy could save his life from sinking like a ton of bricks. The action in this movie was unbelievable. It had none of the humor of the stereotypical violence that was typical of the 80s. It just felt awful. Donald Sutherland was hot and handled his role perfectly. And it was totally OK with me. I was laughing a lot and loving every moment of it. I wish he would have kept his dignity down and
neg The most recent movie I've seen was "Yankee Doodle Dandy" and "Yankee Doodle Dandy" from 1968. I love how the characters were so different in that way. I love how Dandy was never the king or the queen but she was always the queen and was always the "Queen Mary". Dandy was queen by the grace of God and has always been the "Queen Mary II". She is even more so today than when I was queen. So we have here a gem gem from this gem, "Dear Friends, Our Little Do-It-Me-
neg The first episode of Survivor Series 2001 was probably the worst ever, in fact, although it may be voted for as good or bad as a million dollar budgeted budgeted Survivor Series 2001: Due to the fact that most of its cast couldn't discern anything from one another, and it had to be heavily fleshed-out with beautiful lighting. This series may have been voted for as good or bad as a million dollar budgeted event but still falls into the latter category. Judging by how much Mr. Show liked it, I'll give it 3 stars. This series probably won't appeal to everyone, but I will definitely recommend it to those viewers out there who want to see how this came to be. It certainly has the feel of preceding Survivor Series 2001. If you can't sleep, watch it. Avoid it. Avoid it. If you can't sleep, watch it. You'll need Zoloft after this to get up and to rest after the event. 9/10
neg This movie was 100% boring. How do you expect to get a half hour of sleep in a movie theater? What the hell is that even considering that this movie was 100% boring? It was supposed to be funny, not funny, but not funny. It was funny for no other reason than that it was so stupid it compelled people to watch it. It was so weak, it was funny, it just didn't move the story along. I wish I could have watched this movie over and over again but I guess it was because the plot was so weak. The plot wasn't very good and the dialogue was either too bad or too bad for my liking. It was just plain awful bad. It was just plain awful bad. (And I mean, pretty bad, for the actors, they really should have kept their cool and not show the funny part. I wish we would have seen this movie, as we all do.
neg I really enjoyed this movie in the end, and I greatly enjoyed it as much as they did. I enjoyed the confrontation between Al Snow and Regina, the Snow Queen, the Big Screen actress, and Regina, and the very end. I won't bother rehashing all that I did for this movie.
neg This was supposed to be a satire of the '70s and '80s, but despite a staggeringly large amount of bad acting and gratuitous violence the plot was almost completely predictable. It was only saving grace that instead of making fun of it, I got a copy of the movie demons, courtesy of my local cinema. The movie demons were very annoying in that they constantly plying their trade in New York, New York, and Washington Square. I would go as far as to say that the spirits of these notorious crimes were not evil and did not deserve to be called the bad guys in this movie. However, some minor character transformations occur which I think most viewers would agree are good natured, such as the twist that Susan only really sees a few of them fall down a bridge and are immediately put up for a murder. In fact, as soon as they do get out of the company of the bad guys, they tend not to do so much to repair the damage to Susan's reputation, though I did repair some of them later. This was supposed to be a satire during the '70s. It was an extremely poor film. A midget thief steals a big diamond in Wyoming, hides out with his friends
neg This is an enjoyable movie. The plot is extremely well written, the characters are well developed and all the characters are well developed throughout the movie. The story is very well-developed in the first place, and even though I found myself laughing a few times during the closing-shop scene, it still keeps you all laughing. This movie has a great plot, it has a lot going on in it. It has all the characters and their story, and it unfolds very well. There is no question that the movie was made over a long time ago. I am very pleased with the direction it is headed. I really enjoyed watching it for close to four hours, it made me appreciate the atmosphere and quality of living, and it is well worth the investment. Definitely recommend it. If you can't get a good movie from your local cinema, go to the local cinema instead. The quality of the sound and the dialogue is better, and better, and you won't be disappointed.
neg From Hong Kong, Hong Kong, Dominik is now a major cultural event. International events are no exception. To see a good western film in cinemas, or even to see this film in your native language, must be an ABSOLUTE waste of time. It is so bad that it has become standard fare for the non-Chinese-speaking audience in the early 90s. There is absolutely no reason why the subtitles refer to such things as "non existing", "Chinese". If you can't appreciate this film then go see it again. The subtitles refer to you as "non existing", and the entire film is not that great. The only thing that grabs me is the idea that I was in North Africa at the beginning of this film. The concept of non existing is timeless. The concept of Africa and South Africa is timeless, and so is the image of the great King Creole. I was only a relatively small child, but I was taken by this film, as a wee lad and soon I became a huge fan of the film. All of the above mentioned films were classics. Primarily of Africa, and Africa, but with Africa in mind, Africa is still a wonderful place to be. My special favorites

neg This film is mildly entertaining and fun to watch. It is fun to watch the progression of fights and I have seen and survived quite a few in this film. The fights are so well choreographed that I actually felt that I was pulled into them by some of the older guys. They don't hurt the most, however. There is only ONE fight I know about which is the better of them and thats the second and third guy who gets knocked out is the best guy in the whole movie. I will go middle of the road with my honest opinion. I have seen numerous films that were OK as well. I stand corrected. These were OK with me and they never hurt anyone. I have watched the whole movie without complaint. I will be honest here. Not every single fight was good and even if it was, it would have been better if it was at home. No one really cared who won or what the other guy was doing. All of the fights were well worth it and should be watched out for the duration. I wish I was the first to watch and not watch this film. I really enjoyed the fight scenes with the main character and not that much. It was fun to see the rage of the geriatric male
neg This film is so good that it makes me wish that I lived in a big, beautiful house. I can breath, I can chew, I can breath in my sleep, and there are times that I wish for more. This is a perfect example of how much I miss this wonderful village.It is so far out of my league that I can barely get over the scenery and the village looks decrepit, yet still makes me wish I lived in it all the time.Oh, and I can't even wrap my head around the concept of living in a nice village without having to constantly search for a job in order to make ends meet. My thoughts were confirmed this movie was about a nice guy in a nice boat with a nice boat to come and see the family, not like this anymore. I really felt bad for this village after seeing this movie but it was so worth it. I absolutely loved it. I really, really loved it. I loved it when it came out and everyone knew that it was real. I don't know what film this would be next...maybe it would have been a nice feature film but I just felt...amazing. Not bad for the Alamo in this sense.
neg Seriously, I can't even get over the fact that I made this movie in the hope that somebody out there would buy it and that somebody would find it worthy of veneration. What a bore of a plot to base a film on.
neg This film has me in stitches over every single murder, every moment of it unfolds like this: Everyone says that the killer should be punished and there is just ONE MEMORIAL DAY in THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING OF THE CORNER, and thats where it all began. The murders are cold, big, and yet still happenstance and symbolism are the only things in this movie that seem to register with me. What the hell is this supposed to be about? Well, basically, the Theory of Murder is based on the idea that there is some kind of mental or spiritual punishment for those who do not keep their blood relatives clean during their early or early sexual relationships. In essence, it involves grave robbery, or at least some form of it. In some societies where justice still prevails, such situations result in the execution of the first murderer. So, for example, in Denmark, in 18th century Denmark, in 18th century Denmark, and in 18th century France. The execution of the first murderer, sentenced to the ground, must surely have been the day of the glorious cultural event. This theory has been verified by some very interesting historical events. For instance, the execution of the first true abomination in

My wife is expecting (and we had a baby in the van!) and I don't know much about the Women's March on Washington. She doesn't seem to understand the concept of a Women's March. I don't really blame her. The Women's March on Washington was the greatest cultural event of the 20th century.

The murders were justified and there was no other role for women in this movie. None of the characters were mentioned as much, other than the title character, the creepier her personality, and the fact that this movie is a cheap rip-off of the popular
neg This movie is a compilation of the worst films I've ever seen and a compilation of them in my collection. I'd like to wish Alicia Silverstone would come out with her silly lyrics and plain old English at the risk of making a big mistake. Her lover, a man she has chosen to adopt from a "dark' father" who had no memory of her for much of his early life, writes a hapless, unattractive diatribe against her in his letters to her mother, hating her so badly he almost died from boredom at the altar. In it, a bored, bored man writes the wafer-thin diatribe against his daughter, asking for the murder of her and hating her so badly he almost died from boredom. Within 90 seconds of meeting his daughter, Alicia Silverstone is already hating herself and hating herself as much as she wants to get out of this life. So, grab a drink, get some sleep, and enjoy the movie. The cast is decent, and there are decent acting, but what really bothers me about this movie is the direction the director is headed. It's like she wants nothing more than to see this movie, because her life is already bleak and there are no other children
neg This film was very dark and ground-breaking. It is heavily disturbing and it is hard to actually get a good grasp of Heartland, the first true story of this new-media-set. The acting was poor and almost painful, and I don't even know where the cameraman was so he could get a good laugh out of it. Director Kenneth Branagh was on duty in New York at the time and did a great job at portraying this location. The action was speeded up and down in places, but still charming and energetic. The direction is still very dark, and yet charming, and the dialogue is at times surprisingly charming. It is very well-written. I will be recommending this film to anyone needing an example of how to become a great hero of the New York, for example, or how to become a multimillionaire, or an artist, and not for fear of being manipulated by big corporate America. (If you want an example of how to become a great hero of the USA, see my previous great book The Beautiful Beautiful Life of the Beautiful Place, and the book I just gave you.

neg My husband and I were married for many years and we have children from different places. We live in Scotland, we have no idea where this film came from, but we can tell you that it was made in the same household. My wife has a smaller (but still very important) sister in law (Susan) who I had no other children with, and we have no idea where this came from, though we do know that her husband was in North Africa. I had no idea that this film would be so great, and so glad to have stumbled across it years ago.
neg This is one of the best western movies I've ever seen. There is just nothing like a Yellow Spotted Lizard in it, and I can breath the breathing space it takes. It's funny, and even though I've watched the film several times, I can still breath it. I don't think this movie is funny. I think it's a tragedy. I stand corrected. I've watched it several times, and it's still funny. It's funny because I thought some of the dialogue had meaning or were intended meaning. I've read some funny books about how to make a good parody of this movie, and this one was very good. (Besides, I've seen it a lot, and it is still fresh and funny, despite the fact that it has absolutely no parody in it, as well as the fact that it has absolutely nothing against women, and all the rest of the humor is just plain old jokes and plain old jokes that you can find in other films, as well as the love story (which I think you should definitely watch if it continues going on). This movie is so much fun to watch!
neg The Theory Of Flight is simply genious and beautiful. Its star programmer, Ava Gardner, has written a wonderful, beautiful and engaging story about four strangers drifting across the US in an almost-enquirer-in-the-now-famous "san pedro." Within 90 seconds, these four strangers unwittingly fall in love and start a relationship that never will be the same. The plot unfolds in a totally unexpected way that makes no sense at all and leaves behind quite the impression that the fictional love story is just another fantasy. (Both love stories involving real people (and especially the fictional "young" ones) desperately seeking a partner in search of the future. The love story unfolds over two different people: a man who suffers from insomnia and regularly suffers from horrible flashbacks, and the heroine of the love story is a former lover. This relationship involves a very interesting character interracial relations between two strangers (Susan) and a young man (Susan) who desires to adopt Susan from another woman in her life (Susan) after the man leaves her cold, without the possibility of ever having children. The plot unfolds as though it were the Harry Potter movies, and is almost completely devoid of all the meaningful character interplay. It is
neg This extremely long, rambling thriller was actually written by a French journalist. I don't think I've ever seen a better thriller in the 90s. It has a good pace, an engaging cast and a good script. The only disadvantage it has is that it doesn't follow suit to most of the mainstream narrative. I found myself laughing a lot throughout the movie. When I hear the French version, it makes me nervous and makes me nervous even though I can't understand them.I like the simple fact that the villain is so stupid and almost non-existent that it makes me nervous. Of course, the French version has more of the rage of the so-called 'heroine' hating the'media', and I'm pretty sure that the French version isn't so bad. I also liked how the Plot was predictable and thus the ending was predictable and at the time there were predictable close-ups of things. The main disadvantage of this version is that it didn't follow suit to the rest of the film. The only disadvantage of the original is that it didn't follow suit to most of the other French-speaking audiences (they don't understand what a French guy is doing in his native land). But I think this
neg I recently watched and enjoyed Ang Lee: Warrior Princess and The Beauty Queen: Warrior Princess, in particular. Along with the animated series it stars Michelle Pfeiffer, who appears very much like the most beautiful thing ever to come into this world. The acting is very good, and Jo Swerling is very charming in the role. She really grabs the character's character and makes her come alive in this role. It's funny how she almost gets the character's personality in her own way. It's hard to get me to like a bad guy because I can't even pay full enough attention to the woman herself in the title role. However, the acting is still entertaining and entertaining. There were times during the course of the film that I genuinely believed in this movie and thought it was a really great idea of combining two of the best comedic performances of late 90`s movies. This would have been OK with me on DVD but, alas, it is now disposed of and it is finally disposed of. I will say that this film is a great film. I absolutely loved it and will recommend it to all those who love the original film, to those viewers that are looking for a good comedy or love it and those viewers
neg This was supposed to be the story about a four-year-old girl's journey from Middle America to New York. Her friends don't know much about her, but they certainly know that she is a major hottie in New York. There are two stories in this story, one about a French actress playing a spoiled, bigoted mother. The other is about a French actress playing a spoiled father and that is not a story at all. It's a French version of "Single White Chicks." I don't know what the hell it is, though. (I know that I was the femme fatale in this movie and I had no idea what was going on.) And the third story involves the mysterious *PÃ¨re-Lachaise* who *PÃ¨re-du-Faubourgis* seducing and even more *PÃ¨re* seducing her husband, through letters passed through his daughter's social media profile.

neg I will be honest and upfront, I really didn't expect to see this movie. I was only very excited for this movie. There were barely any extras (one knife, two fangirling, etc) and the acting was terrible. There were a few mistakes throughout the movie. One of them was the title of the movie. I had no idea what movie that was going to be. What a let down. Not even George Kennedy was in there when he shot down all four of the hijinks in this movie. There were a few other mistakes in the making of this movie. First of all the hijinks were mentioned in the title. It is important to remember that although most of the hijinks were mentioned by the title already mentioned in the movie, this is the first movie to come out in theaters. Not surprisingly, though. This movie has had a very good opening reel as well as a good ending. I enjoyed the movie. Was it good? Was it good? Definitely. Worth recommending.
neg This movie had none of the above. People getting hit by flying glass in New York during World War II were not amused. People getting knocked backward in the head were not amused. It was actually very funny. Everyone who serves time in the Army is punished for their wasted time. People getting hit in the head are not punished by being punished nor are they punished for it. In fact, some people get kicked in the balls not even halfway through the movie. I remember one instance in which a serviceman got kicked in the balls because he couldn't sleep, because he couldn't get up and did nothing. This is typical American punishment, but I won't bother citing it. This movie wasn't funny. If I can get this one out of me fast, I will. I was in the Army for 20 years and I still congratulate myself for that time.I can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was funny, but I certainly did enjoy it. I think that this movie is the worst movie I have ever seen. It's terrible. I can't get over all the gratuitous nudity and there are scenes in which the Nazi's are almost completely naked and can be heard laughing about it. How many people

It has an extraordinary cast that is made up of entirely believable, talented people that make a great many different stories involving different characters and plot twists. It is well-written and very well acted. Very well-written. Worth recommending this movie to anyone needing a dose of "what if" horror?
neg It is still an interesting film, and I hope that the director, writer, and star will give it a chance. If they can convince me that this movie is real, then I will definitely recommend it. It is extremely difficult to actually put one's thoughts about the subject into words, and I must say that even the most infantile viewer would be unable to open their minds to a comprehensive, complete, and honest assessment of the subject matter. If I were to do this again I would have to ask myself, "Do I miss anything interesting in this film?". This is a very interesting film about modern day relationships, not post Depression, as much as the 1940s Depression. Its not about the Depression, but it is a very good introduction to how to approach the subject in a

neg This movie is extremely weak and uninspired at best. It portrays some basic human psychology (cf. the self-esteem problem) and justifiably so. It doesn't follow suit well with the rest of the story, or at least I can't find the plot to it. The villain of the movie is an extremely well-developed character who seems like he was just playing a gloriously righteous man, and is often played by a very annoying, overacted girlfriend. The plot also suffers from the fact that it was written with great care and thought. The supporting characters are well-developed and the villain is a very nice guy who gets a job by training a bunch of bad guys. None of the main characters (male, female, or guy) are particularly gruesome (cf. the extreme bad guy). The action scenes are weak, and the fight scenes just laughable. I think that there's something valuable about the villain's personality, and that his motives are very important to the story. I don't see why the hell anyone would do that, unless the villain had some kind of mental issues. I really felt bad for the villain's insinuation that all evil needs a "psychological process" in order to work its
neg This film was so awful it compelled me to register it. Everyone says something about "horror" every time we see this film. Everyone says "there is some kind of thing going on" because they think the ghosts inhabit our world. Not so! A classic horror movie, with lots of bloodshed, yet a good dose of good fun and a good dose of mystery and intrigue...It's nice to finally see "True" on the big screen. Enjoy!
neg This movie is awful. It's lame, lame, lame. It has some lame acting and it is lame at best and most insulting to all time and again. It's lame because it seems to think you need a million dollar budget to make a good horror movie. There are two decent horror movies out there. One is about a young vampire killer (Nightmares) strangled in an old wood pile, the other is about a vampire killer (Nightmares Unlimited) strangled in a hailstorm of chocolate covered espresso beans. Both are awful.One of these is a nice attempt at humor by the cast and directors at a time when people were discussing the guilt and/or the repressed sexual needs of their loved ones. The other is an awful miss job. I found myself laughing a few times throughout the entire film and hating it. Not that it hurt my heart that much. I wish it would have ended up with such a good ending as this.
neg Seriously, you should watch the whole film. Don't watch it until your bloodbath has ended, it's a definite snoozer. Don't watch it until after it's over and it's over again, though.

neg This movie is extremely good, and I loved it for its cast, direction, and direction in general. It has a good pace, and its villain is very well-developed. I admire Hugo Matuschek's taste for violence in general, but this is still considered a good movie to watch. This movie was very good for me and I wish I would have watched it years ago, but it has now been pulled into focus due to the fact that I don't seem to understand the villain so much now. So the villain is very well-developed, it seems like he was introduced at the beginning of the movie. I know that the plot is very well-developed, but it is still very well-developed. I know from my own experience that even though I've watched the movie it has made me very very happy to see it again. The plot seems very well-developed and I am certain that this movie was pulled into conclusion very shortly after the conclusion. But this is a good movie, not bad, and its conclusion really just as good. I wish it would have kept this up to the movie like this. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone needing a dose of love for a good thriller, and

Not only did he get me to like him, but I still have not seen this movie and can't seem to muster the strength to say anything about it. Not even a peep from the reporters in this movie. The acting wasn't as bad as in the original but the acting was still poor, and there was no funny scene in the closing monologue, so I can't breath the breathing space these people give. There was just some bad acting. There were some mistakes made and some scenes that were very silly, and some of them were actually worse than the original. What a waste of time!
neg This movie was just plain fun.I love how the cast and directors were able to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles during the Depression years. I loved every moment in the entire movie. They had fun with the acting and they made a good point about the fact that it was filmed in a very dark time. This movie is one of those movies that is very good fun for those of us who are young and are looking for an independent film in a "younger" Hollywood. I enjoy a lot of acting in it and can't wait to see more films like that in the near future. But the story and the characters are still fresh and interesting.There are too many predictable events, there are too many plot twists, and there is absolutely no grey area in this movie. This movie has a good pace, good pace of acting, and the acting is decent. I can't get over how much of a struggle it has been because the acting is so bad, and there is a nice little triangle going in this movie, just a little over the top in the title. Overall, a great movie, especially since it has a good supporting cast. Definitely recommend this movie.
neg This film is extremely disturbing, in large part because of the fact that most of the dialogue and dialogue is actually about the nature of human relationships, especially the nature of the relationships between men and women.

neg This film has a very good plot and a very good direction. The villain is very well portrayed. We find out that the main character is Anastasia (whom I had previously admired from a very young age) a former lover of mine and has a very good job as an artist. I am pleased to say that the villain is very well portrayed. He is well portrayed in that role. Overall this film is a very good movie, fun to watch and very entertaining for all ages. I found this movie to be the perfect partner for Giada Colagrande's Beautiful (1999). It was also very fun for the entire cast to share their love story and it makes it all the more enjoyable for everyone to watch.
neg This is the quintessential horror film of the 90s. In the early 90s, the popular horror genre of bad movies followed suit by big budget spookiness. The bad guys go around town, meet up with big budget writers, directors, programmers, programmers, programmers... and basically whatever approach they go with is just not enough to sustain the genre in the near future. The bad guys are butt naked in front of the whole village in what seems like an all-encompassing village-sanctioned murder mystery. The bad guys always win. THEY go after the weak and the few who stand a chance of getting slit open. The bad guy is a spoiled, bigoted pervert, and his motives are both cold and plain. The main disadvantage of bad movies is that the plot is almost completely predictable and there is absolutely no grey area between the two protagonists. There is only ONE HISTORICAL DAY in the entire story. This means that THE MAST OF BORNEO has meaning, meaning, and the conclusion is just as predictable as a pile of soup, or rather an elephant in the room. It's easy to miss this, and there are a few brilliant visual jokes galore. (Besides the

If you can't appreciate it, get the hell out of your car!
neg This is a classic movie, made with good direction and an engaging cast. I highly recommend it, especially for those fans of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" movies. This is a great movie for those people who love the original sound and feel, and those who enjoy mixing and hodgepodge styles with "Yankee Doodle Dandy" style can be very happy with this movie. Of course, the characters are well developed and there are some decent plot twists and allusions are there. The action was conducted in a way that is very cleverly done. The direction of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" is upbeat, and you don't need a million dollar budget to do it well. All the characters are well developed, and you have them all along with a good supporting cast. The story was very well told, and the direction was very cleverly done. It was well written. I highly recommend it for anyone who loves Dandy Doodle Dandy Dandy Movie, Dandy Doodle Dandy Doodle Dandy Doodle Dandy!!! Go watch it if you can't sleep, because I won't give you my honest opinion.
neg After seeing this movie I got a bit carried away. Not so much because I didn't like what they did, or because I didn't like how bad it was. But I was sick and tired from writing this, so I finally gave this magnificent, ground-breaking, and intelligent, funny, and current-media-acceptable A.I. (put simply, I stand corrected!) Most people who expect an intelligent reviewer to give this magnificent, insightful, and insightful, must be either asleep or in some kind of mental disarray, and that's where it all began. What's more, I found this film to be very good, fun to watch in all of its myriad wonderful directions, and its characters are surprisingly charming. The supporting cast is surprisingly charming, and Marlene Dietrich is just as charming as the caveman she is playing in the caveman's home. Donald Sutherland is prickly and yet believable as the caveman, played by Michelle Pfeiffer in this charming little bugger's outfit. Basil Rathbone is aptly geeky, and yet she is charming in this movie. Donald Sutherland is prickly and abrupt and she is entertaining in her outrageous behaviour, and she shows a loveable character in

neg This movie is a rip-off of Star Wars. There is no getting around this easily. There is just no getting around it. Its plot is extremely weak and thus it cannot be very well-developed and quality-conscious. The acting is weak, and thus its villain, Raul E.

I was in high school with bad guys and bad guys. I had bad flashbacks, and thought this movie was lame. What the heck did I miss? Oh my gosh... this movie is lame. Don't get me wrong.It's funny. I love the simplicity. I love the simple things, and the characters are allusions to the hero. It's a very good lesson for all ages. If you can't appreciate this movie, skip it.
neg This is not the best movie I have ever seen. It was extremely difficult to put my finger on but I think the story was almost worth it. The dialogue was disturbing, at times touching, at times making it seem like I was reading a novel. It was extremely disturbing, at times making it appear like I was reading a book. This film is so disturbing that I actually had to register with my friends about it. So, in conclusion, this movie is not for the weak of stomach or mind, just make it scary and scary and make it realistic. That way I can breath the breathing space these people had and still get my blood pressure down. That way I can actually feel my blood pressure and breathing as though they were in constant struggle. It's so weak. I can barely breath, I can barely move a finger. I don't really blame him. Whatever the reason, this movie was so bad. Its message was not good, not at all. Its message was a dumbed down version of "Don't Look Now" and all that crap. I found this film to be very entertaining and at times entertaining. Don't get me wrong, I love the acting and the acting.

neg The movie was extremely weak and uninspired. It was robotic, uninspired and did not follow suit to most of its charm. Even more so, it did not follow suit to most of the guidelines I had previously been reading about before going into this movie. I would fill the shelves with boring junk and waiting room for an interminable two hours to find a suitable partner for me. But this movie did not follow suit and it is not perfect. I found myself laughing a few times, and even more distressing to see how Anastasia changed throughout the entire film. She really should have been eliminated from the movie, as this movie is so much better for her that it makes her appealing. There are some gem lines, such as "Beau Geste" and "Kalifornia" which I felt were forced, but otherwise, pretty hilarious. I found myself laughing a few times as well and loving every moment of it. I will always be very surprised when I see new material from other horror movies, but this movie really grabs my heart and minds. I really can't wait to see more!

It has an extraordinary cast that includes Leslie, the creepier and ugliest thing ever, the creepier Myrna, the doting sister Myrna, the creepier Myrna, and even more so, the creepier, yet still having that little sister Myrna (partaking of the Myrna sex play during the party) playing the creepier Myrna in a hapless play that almost makes Myrna's life worse.

Regina is still the king of Regina, Regina II is still a queen with an added capital, Regina has the upper hand and the upper hand in her regal seat at the King's New Beverly theater. Regina's life revolves around her constant struggles with various men and the "character" of Regina. Regina is often the first to come into the King's Family through a "regular" role in Regina's life. Regina's love story revolves around Regina's struggles with various men, including the King's insinuation that she has a sexual attraction to Regina's character. Regina's father, the Great Splendini (who Regina almost always had with her)is not only a king but also has a sexual attraction to Regina's character, Regina's struggles with various men in her life and Regina's struggles with various men in her life. There are even more important events in Regina's life than her father's life, however Regina's own struggles with her mother (who also has a sexual attraction to Regina) and sister (who also has a sexual attraction to Regina) come into focus
neg Although the movie is good and current, its villain is somewhat contrived. There are some brilliant scenes which simply don't move the narrative along. Plot wise the villain is a very good guy, he is not an actor like most of the stereotypical bad guys in Hollywood, he is just a guy with a fierce, swashbuckling pirate exterior. I am not surprised by this movie's villain so much, as he is simply in charge of the plot and doesn't give much away. There is a nice side-set which seems to work well for those of us who enjoy Ang Lee and will watch this movie. It is clever how the villain is able to convince us that we all are persons of good character and not evil because we all need to be punished for bad behaviour, rather by pointing out to us in a way that makes it easier to forgive the bad guy and that we all can sympathise with him. If you like inciteful movies and you enjoy Lee please give this movie a miss!
neg This movie is just plain fun to watch! It has fun being a part of the family, but not everyone gets along so easily. I really liked Cinderella in this movie. If you can't love a man, you can't get him.
neg My husband and I recently separated after several days apart. My thoughts were confirmed that my wife had died, something we hadn't even asked for in the early 80s. I had seen some funny and entertaining movies the previous two years, and by far the most entertaining of the two of them was "Hamlet". Of course this movie became my "holiday horror" for the rest of my life. I wish I'd watched it again, but for the life of me. My thoughts were confirmed by this. Once I saw it I got the "holiday horror" and became thrilled. It was such a great movie. I loved how everyone knew it was coming. Everyone knew that I loved it and I would miss it in the near future. Would like to see it again, if you can't wait for it.
neg My husband, who I have been very quiet in my life, died in 2004 at age 11 after a long, hard, mental struggle. I am not surprised to hear the story that it is true. I had previously been very quiet and very quiet, but this made it easier for me to accept that this was not entirely true.I had no idea that my wife and I had recently separated. Although she was very quiet in some parts of the house, she actually gave me a kiss when we were out drinking in my old room. When I went to get my blood work I found myself laughing a little.I was in the same boat. I love her and think we all should do the same. This was the best thing to happen to me. I would like to share this story with you all, because I found it particularly heart-wrenching and touching how our first true love story came to be.I am extremely very very pleased to say that we have now been through some pretty lame, uninspired and badly-conceived (and maybe even worse) movies over the years. Unfortunately I found this to be quite a struggle, as there were barely any bright literary or artistic energies in the film. My thoughts
neg I found this extremely disturbing at the time of its release. The entire film is extremely disturbing, and it continues to wreak havoc on our patience and minds at a young age. What really bothers me about it is that even though I know that it is experimental cinema that makes movies, and that my influences are in many films, the characters are so stupid and white that I have no idea where they came from. What I found incomprehensible was how they chose not to follow suit. There were too many of the stereotypical characteristics of many white male characters in the film. That is a gross understatement. I am so ashamed I can't even begin to speak to the characters' racial stereotyping and misogyny, but I will here be brief. I admire the fact that so many white people have written books about the history of the film. Not one, not two books. All of the characters are so stupid and white-trash. They certainly don't deserve a miss. Rating. Rating this film is a disgusting portrayal of the 'dark' side of our culture, and we should give it another 3. This film suffers from the same problem I often encounter in other films (particularly, about white people). In fact, I am pleased
neg This film seems aimless at best and at worst it portrays the view of an American haunting in a totally unenjoyable setting. The haunting of the young Carlito and the young Carlito are played out in a hapless village by a drifter named Ismael Lorenz and his cohorts. Lorenz has a very interesting character that seems like he was manipulated and moulded throughout his life. After traveling across the US with his crooked promoter, he reaches a new set of people in New York. After convincing them that he is not a hit-man, they plan a murder plot. In a totally unpretentious plot they plan to use the young Carlito as an example of how to murder his way to sudden victory and send him to the "death " mental institution" through bariatric surgery. To complicate matters, the plot is extremely poor. The main character is a drifter with no memory of his crimes even though he has hardened to become a multimillionaire by training his country's finest sleuths. When they do get him to the island he is given a rare treat and an expensive drink to keep him going. Lorenz also suffers from a mental process called "dream" and he is told that
pos From then on, as far back as I can remember, Hollywood has made tons of movies about how to achieve a certain amount of sexual satisfaction without resorting to the "art of film". Most of them are OK, great films. They have sex scenes, romance, romance, romance...but none of those movies really hurt the feelings of the viewers, it just adds up to a nice evening in the company. Not that much of it. And the actors are usually the best and worst in Hollywood. Not that this film hurt the feelings of the viewers either! I don't blame them though. I was pulled into it because I wanted to watch dirty movies with lots of blood and graphic sex scenes. It was supposed to be about getting high, but as soon as the director came on board and started acting, I realized I had not seen a movie like that in years. It has been years since I watched dirty movies, and while I can't give you an example of how to become a good actress in a film, I can tell you that frequent masturbation during the movie scenes can be very good for some people.
pos The original movie was a rip-off of the masterpeice "demons" or spiritual train wrecks of old New York City, New York. In the climax, a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans appears at the beginning of the movie intending to eat the world. This movie was about a civilization that had been wiped out by greed and ambition. Its villain, played by a maniacal, was a blustery big baddie. The plot is extremely well-written and the supporting characters are well-developed and believable. I highly recommend it for those who enjoy fast paced, action and are looking forward to see more of the same. Definitely watch this movie, especially if it is your first time around and you like fast paced, fast paced, fast paced movies. Definitely recommend it for those people who like fast paced, fast paced movies but still having a good fun!
pos Where was this film when I was young? It was funny, funny, funny and funny and scary. But at the time this film was releasing there was no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard in Hollywood. The Lizard was the sheriff, and he carried a pet brontosaurus in his back. The two exchanged a kiss on the head "for a few minutes."Then the two of them got into an old fashioned karate duel. After that, another karate duel went on for 45 minutes and 45 minutes. It was funny, the fight had a great finish, and the winner was a giant crab attack by a couple of karate-eating maniacs. The fighting was great. The battle Royalty was just as good as the kung fu king in the original King of the Hill, and even though we all knew that this film was a good parody of the real thing, I still can't help but wonder if it was inspired by the original King of the Hill: Warrior Princess. Other than that, it was funny, funny, scary, and very good acting. All 3 of the above mentioned things make me wish to see this film again. I love the King of the Hill!
pos It is very well made and is well worth watching. There are some great twists and turns in the story that really give this movie its power and its predictability. The villain is very well portrayed and has a very interesting personality, but she is very well portrayed. Overall it is a great movie. Very well worth the investment. I highly recommend it. Highly recommended. -
pos This was so much of a rip-off of another great British treasure-troop film, "The Hand That Rocks Like A Little" by William Powell, and was so good it became a part of my CV. The entire cast is fantastic. Every moving and charming character is charming and charming. There are times you feel that something is off-putting. Powell dissolves the mystery into a sweetie-shop-boy/dont-know-what-that-was-scene, and then you have to watch it all over again in your mind. Powell dissolves the mystery into a beautiful whirling mess of love and tragedy.Oh, and this is one of those "holiday horror" movies you love to watch in the hope that it keeps you purring from the guilt that comes with the loathsome.
pos Excellent comedy, comedy, romance...very good job!!! Im glad i saw this film about 3 years ago but this is still fresh and funny and thats where all the fun is. Im glad they took a chance on me and I love their movie so much. Definitely recommend it!!! Thanks for making this film. I wish god could save my life and maybe even save some more
pos I love Cinderella, but this is definitely not Cinderella II:Dreams Come True. It was released on
pos This is one of the best motion pictures ever made. There isn't much going on in it, and there isn't much going on in the film that makes it worth watching. This is a definite must watch for those who love to film in the "dark" side of things, and those who love and are attracted by the enchanting coulisses will find it particularly heart-wrenching when placed next to such enchanting, beautiful and engaging coulisses. This film is just plain fun to watch if you love animals, especially in small village-level situations. You won't find a film that makes me laugh anymore, and you won't find it here. All the good things about this film are well worth it. Respect your local animal rights, no matter where it is filmed, and always remember to stack the dishwasher in the back of the house if it's opened--
pos This movie was very good, and I wish Alicia Silverstone would give this movie a chance. Maybe it would have been pulled off a little better, but more important, and maybe even better. If I were a director, I know that the acting would have dove deeper. The acting was so...amazing! Alicia Silverstone really should have dove deeper into this, too. She really should have dove into this instead of simply wasting money on a ticket. It would have been OK. Her performance in this movie was really terrible. She really couldn't move a finger in a movie like this one. Her lover is not even in the movie anymore. The hotelier in the movie was a hero of the peace and justice struggle, and I was totally wasted time in this too. I really can't say how bad it was, but I don't know how bad it was. Overall, this movie is outstanding! Definitely recommend this movie to anyone!
pos The first time I ever saw this movie I definitely hated it and I definitely will be turning it over to watch again. My friends insisted upon seeing this and soon after they
pos Very good martial arts film. It is highly rated. Good acting, very good direction. Very good acting. Very good plot. Good fight choreography, good direction. (I missed it in the original version, but it is in the movie that I still think of)I won't bother rehashing the plot. None of the characters are likable and all portray that seems aimless. Overall, good martial arts film. 9 out of 10.
pos Back in 2004 the US Air Force had released a slew of quality documentary film "Nightmares" that they dubbed into English dubbed into American. This movie had the feel of being a genuine British war time classic, but at the time it was so much more than that. It was uplifting, true to the tale and true to the spirit. It was a genuine British war time classic, and it was uplifting to see faith and justice in the ultimate sacrifice of the fallen, not just in the literal sense but also in relation to those who were still alive. There was humor and there was defiance in the making of the film. The plot was not perfect (there were too many of them in the film), but rather formulated and logical and it was funny and touching. It was also very dark humor, and I loved every moment of it. Overall, the film did a wonderful job of bringing together memories of the war years, and the personal crises that surround us in this nation. I can't speak to the trivia of how much of the story is being told in this film, but you will be cheering me on! I really enjoyed it and wish we would have made it into a movie! I really wanted to see more

pos Time has not been kind to this movie in my life, mostly because it has taken me through many bad years to get over it. However, I am pleased to say that it is well worth watching and will recommend it to all my friends and family. There is something about that unpretentiousness in it that makes it appealing to them all: There is simply no place in the entire story (the plot, etc) for this movie in the aforementioned description. This movie is simply boring, lame, lame and ridiculous. It really is all about the bad guys (martin/martin) who want to get away with murder because they think it is the only way to get away with your friends because they are dirty or simply plain stupid. The entire movie is just an excuse to get some sleep, a way to get some sleep in and not give in to the constant online bullying you often get in the early night. The villain of this movie is the bad guy, in my mind. The plot is a tad contrived and the villain (martin) really should have been out of place in the story. What I liked about it is that it was actually pretty much fun. A nice feature is that even though I
pos Excellent movie and I still congratulate everyone who made this film. I congratulate them for making a film that is worthy of appreciation to all viewers. It is a perfect portrayal of the '70s Los Angeles, and its charm is innate. And, of course, the acting is perfect. The acting is perfect, I must say. Donald Sutherland is charming as always, and Marlon Brando as always, and he is the perfect partner.The film is bleak and hopeful. It is a real tale. If you love love a good horror film (or, rather, good comedy) keep looking!
pos Before the project was finished, this project was considered so great it compelled me to do it. I've read every single book I can find. There were some brilliant, engaging and insightful literary allusions that should have been there. I love the twist where Anisio Eirinosi (the wife of King Arthur) finally meets the heroine (the "old friend" she has) in her thirties, and she shows how much more real love can come in a thirties, when she finally gets older.I love that Anisio Eirinosi is married to the king in yet another way, and she is still very much in love with him. She has also a son, Tadashi, and a son, Tadashi, who is only a few months away from being king. All this while she still has a very special bond with King Arthur.I love her, I always will. She is just such a great actress.Very kind and kind, every moment of her personality and manner is beautiful, every moment she is truly here. She is very much into her characters and how they all talk about love and life. She is also very much into herself, she seems to have a fierce love for

pos Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore and Marlon Brando in 1954. Moore is Arthur, a king of England, and Arthur is entertaining, entertaining, and at the same time entertaining. He also has good players like Alfred Junge and Clara Novak (who also serves as the lower house justice of England during World War II) and Dick Powell (who also appears as the lower house justice of England during World War II). Moore is entertaining (even though he pretends to be a very good magician), especially in King Arthur's tale, and especially in King Lear. Powell has good direction, good performances (particularly in King Lear), and good direction by Dudley Moore. Moore is Arthur's sidekick in King Lear, and he is Arthur's spy, so we have seen and survived many of Arthur's tragic life through his side kick. This is good, and Arthur's dignity is still high. Arthur is just as bad as King Lear, and so it is nice to see Arthur again in King Lear as a king. The second half of King Lear is boring, not funny, and has very little substance. Moore's direction relies on an old English village magician's show (which is also very good) and his rather flat,
pos Before I go to this film I wanted to give this magnificent 3-D remake of Buster Keaton's "Hamlet" the veneration it unquestionably deserves. This is a real gem of a motion picture, made in no small part because the cameraman, who is so perfectly in charge of everything, must be on the mark for this magnificent performance by Keaton. It is only natural that he should be in charge of directing, and this is not his first feature film (he was in charge of "Hamlet" for "Dear Friends" in 1934). My special favorites are silent version of "Hamlet" and "Dear Friends" (with John Gielgud), "Hamlet" and "Dear Friends" by Christopher Walken. "Hamlet" is simply beautiful and touching. Don't get me wrong, the love story is beautiful. You had better watch it, though. This is not my favorite motion picture, and is a definite snoozer. Respect to Keaton.
pos My first reaction upon seeing this movie was shock value. Not one movie that I've ever seen that involved violence, graphic sex, graphic sex or anything at all. What I found interesting was that throughout the entire movie there were explicit scenes concerning the various ways that various kinds of men try to get a hold of women through the machinations of paramour Spencer Tracy (Frank Morgan, D.J. Soles, Myrna Rambeau and many others) and the ways men try to get hold of their women through their machinations. Most of the scenes were filmed well in all, and especially the ones about the "procrastinate" relationship between Spencer and Billy Madison (Melvyn Douglas). Tracy also had a role to play, played mostly by Rosalind Russell. She was very good in that role, especially in this movie. She was very good, and especially in "The Department of Acceptable Media" role. Tracy was just hot, and yet still kind. She made good standard readings of my thoughts about the film. She was funny and charming, and especially during the first half hour of the movie. There was also a nice little triangle going around that I can really get my blood boiling over (although
pos Very good remake of "Friday the 13'Th". This movie was very good and did an amazing job at bringing together two stories with humor. The acting was perfect. I don't know much about film history, but this one is interesting. I can't find anything interesting in it. I'd like to argue that the Plot was too high, the dialogue too gruesome. If you can't appreciate that it was filmed over 70% of what you would get here, it was probably because you had a hard time getting the most gruesome scenes in the original and had to put a different director in there. Overall good movie. Overall, great movie. Im glad to see more like this again.
pos My husband has died in hospital. I am very excited to find out what will happen to him after this. And I congratulate him on his amazing performance in this movie!!! I love the acting!!! (where is the dialogue?)I love how Anastasia changed her looks
pos Timberlake was never asked for permission to play The Patriot in America. He did play the Patriot dream in his mind during this biopic helmed by Brad Pitt, previously the Patriot who would become the first major star of Hollywood. This was despite the fact that he did not enjoy much in his time with Hollywood, and that he made numerous movies that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular coups.In one sense, this is vintage Caine, and his Patriot dream has been alive and well since the Patriot dream has been realized. In addition to being a major star of Hollywood, he made numerous movies that relied on his expertise in staging spectacular coups, espionage thriller/dynamic comedy and romance involving large scale events. This was also during the Patriot era, and he would go on to become one of the most enduring and enduring Hollywood prima donnas of all time. (The Patriot dream has been alive and well despite the fact that it has been virtually unrecognizable from the 1940s, even though Brad Pitt is still in charge of the filmography.) The Patriot dream has been alive and well throughout the Patriot era and it continues to inspire our nation. Our nation's hopes for a better future lie with the arrival of
pos This is a compilation of my thoughts and commentaries on various social justice issues. There are some good things in it and some bad things. A good start with some good plot twists and some bad. A bad ending is when the plot twists are forced and the characters get sucked into this crap. Overall this is a good compilation of all of my thoughts and a good lesson in how not to act like a spoiled, bigoted individual who gets sucked into this crap because he/she/they think it all is so great and so bad. I wish I was able to give more feedback on what kind of person this person is. My honest opinion is that it's not worthy of a read.
pos It is well-written and follows suit to some extent, but its main disadvantage is its length. The story seems aimless at best, giving the impression that there is something hidden in the story that may be hidden but perhaps still valuable in it. Of course, the main disadvantage of the story is that it is largely a welfare project, and that the government is unable to provide its basic
pos From Star Wars: The Old Republic, this movie is an enjoyable, fun, and quality movie that finds its heroes among the evil that you find themselves in the end. And if you love the mystery or love the mystery of the mysterious force that is the force that operates the universe, this movie is for you. The story introduces us to our protagonist, a former journalist who wants to investigate a mysterious force outside the control of the government. After several months without having much of a connection with the government, we enlist a motley group of people that we come to care for. They all talk about how they came to this world and have some interesting character's or relationships with the government. And of course, there is humor and mystery surrounding the plot. Along with that, there is humor in the title. Overall a great film. Very fun movie. Rich, fun to watch if you can't wait to see it again.
pos This movie is a fun, fun to watch, and I highly recommend it to all ages! I have
pos Very good job, I wish I could hire you as a cinematographer but that seems to be a big ask. Not a big fan of bad directing but a lot of good ideas, music, direction...perhaps a bit too much. I love the simplicity in the title and the fact that the story is pretty much like a romantic love story but also has a good supporting cast. I like how Anastasia changed a little in that little girl from 'Dear Friends' to 'Bimbo' in the original but, alas, it continues to look great all the way through. Nowadays I like to shoot a romantic comedy with love and tragedy. This movie is perfect for that and I wish to recommend it to all my friends and family.
pos Very disappointing film. There were too many mistakes in this movie. There was no violence, no lewdness, no lewdness, no lewdness in it. The only lewdness was the words "felony". The movie was about a black friend from Africa who was kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery in a black community in this nation. She is now a "younger" and "younger" in her 20s, and has severe mental issues. She is now married to her first son and the only child of her two young men. After his wife is killed off and her mother is taken by the "boy". She starts a new relationship with another man, and the relationship is not what it was like when he was first introduced to her, she believes herself to be a very good person. This relationship has not been the greatest in her life. A married couple has two young children. They have to do it with someone else in need of their attention. The young man gets a job, gets a job, gets a promotion to an Aussie-speaking postdoc, and gets to practise his trade in the Australian community. Within a matter of hours, I was in North Africa for about two hours and still
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. This is a compilation of stories, stories that are either poorly written, poorly fleshed-out, or simply plain unfunny. I've read a lot of great books and I know lots of them. None of them are the greatest, and I wish I'd stumbled across them years ago. Nowadays I read a lot of books and have to grind them down to a manageable yet beautiful finish. I can't find the words to put into words. Not even George Kennedy's "American exceptionalism" in his title, which I think is a good lesson in civility to all those around him. (His wife, Georgia, was so kind!) I read a great many books on the subject, and some of them are good. But none of them really hurt me in the slightest. I was dragged along by a very annoying small child who insisted on having his picture taken with his friends. So, no matter what happens, you should give this movie a chance.
pos Of course, there was that funny arachnid movie about Osama Bin Laden that just didn't live up to rest of his comedic styling. This movie was supposed to be about the plot and not Osama Bin Laden. Bin Laden was a major plot point in this movie. Bin Laden was revealed as a true terrorist who was an al-Qaeda sympathiser and a former major plot plot point was the progression of an al-Qaeda plot to get the US into World War III by

pos Time has not been kind to Hollywood in this movie. I can tell you that it has improved drastically since the original was released. I highly recommend it to those who appreciate it and to those who expect Ingmar Bergman's witty and engaging new direction. This is a must see for all ages and all levels of actors and directors.
pos Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore supported by Dudley Moore, and superb direction by Brad Sykes and Dan Harmon. Moore is Arthur, an inventor of illusions; a man who believes in an intelligent being that can act, through logical process and application of reason, to create things; a man who believes in a wonderful thing called "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" and a brilliant inventor of illusions, responds in an almost mystical, compelling way by convincing his wife of the crimes he has been doing. This film is among the best things I ever watch in theaters. Moore is so convincing in his own way that you actually feel he is sincere, you just can't help but laugh in his place. This film is Arthur. Moore is so convincing in his own way that you actually feel that you're watching a real-life version of this classic Arthur. This film was never about the witches or his business, but rather about Arthur's life. You can't help but laugh in his place. I really enjoyed it! (Besides, I mentioned that I had seen a real-life version of this in the shops. And of course, Arthur is Arthur's sidekick, so it makes sense.) Moore pretty much wrote the whole film in
pos It is not about banning movies, it is about banning violence in all form. Anybody can watch a movie if they like inciteful enough, and they can do it without resorting to a "cop". This movie was not about banning the film violence, and instead, it was about banning all movies that were clearly depicted in it. This movie was about a man hating white people because of their supposed "American" heritage, and hating all the bad films out there. All of the bad films were supposed to be about the struggles of immigrant immigrants in this nation, and the struggles of the immigrant community. To the credit of the creators of the movie, this movie did not inciteful enough to register with them as a film about the struggles of the immigrant community. This is just not enough proof of the racial stereotyping in this movie. The problem is that, as soon as you see a black friend of mine (whom I later learned as a police detective) teaching a black friend about how to make movies about her (whom I later learned as a local tv station) you will see his face every time you see the film. These movies promoted violence against immigrants, especially of women of colour. If you were born
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. Its focus has fallen on the poor casting in some parts and it has now been put on more focus on the villain. This film has barely been done and is essentially a compilation of recycled material. There are some good plot twists which you can get a good grasp on and some decent direction. Overall it is a mediocre film. A great fun film to watch, I really enjoyed it and it continues to amaze me. Worth
pos Seriously, if I wanted to shoot Maggie Smith, Maggie Smith, and Dick Powell in my grave, I'm going to shoot them all in the first place. It takes a village called Waller, and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. This movie had me in stitches as the bad guys. (Besides, I had to watch the whole village go to ground level, meet the bad guys, and maybe even get some sleep!) But I guess I don't blame the village because I did it well. I was at a party in the early afternoon, and it was my idea to go to the nearest log fire and have some fun with my friends. While it was so, there were too many "fun" moments (even though we were at least 'winged it') and the entire village wasted no time in aggravation. I wish I could have brought Maggie and Dick to this village and maybe even made them a part of the fun, but that would be a tragedy if it wasn't for them. If there is such a thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard, it will eat its victims and eat them alive! If you want to be a part of the "permanent record" (that is
pos Excellent martial arts film with good acting and good directing.I like Ang Lee pretty much, but this is one of those cases that takes a long time to get to like and is generally not worth the time. Once I get to see the new material it takes me a while to get used to. Once I get to like the new material it takes me a little while to get used to walking in on the weird territory, and maybe that's because it's easier to get used to walking in on your local entertainment stores. But hey, at least I gave this film 4.5 out of five stars.
pos Where does this come from? The Theory Of Flight is simple and logical, as explained by the title. Flight is what we all do, in some way, at the beginning of a long, drawn-out "doc."doc." There is no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard. It is a wonderful thing to behold. It is a Yellow Spotted Lizard, the native habitat of many different
pos The original 101 was extremely good but not as good as 101 if you can actually buy it yourself. I wish it were more like 101 if I could have bought the whole thing myself, I really can't think of anything bad about this movie. I would recommend this movie to anyone who has ever watched it and is looking for an excuse to jump off the couch and head to the movies. Its length was unbelievable. I would recommend it for those people needing a break in or a break in to stay up to do their job. Not one to be surprised by the unexpected arrival of new fans.
pos The entire movie is just plain fun and I really can't seem to get my head around how much this movie is going on. It is not heavily budgeted, though there are some brilliant supporting work from Marlene Dietrich and Montgomery Clift in the title roles. The supporting work is excellent and Montgomery Clift is superb in this role, playing the character who loves to dramatize the relationships of people she knows and who often go through life in these relationships, even though she is married to Montgomery Clift in some way. It is also great, the cast is soo good that even though I am married to Clift recently (yes, it is very much of course) we still get the "good guy" sidekick, even though he now seems very much less so than he was

Shortly after taking part in the sexual slavery of some of the Alamo protagonists, Red Skelton succumbed to leukemia and is now virtually unrecognizable from his dead body.

His new novel, Naked Gun, is an Oscar-winning best-seller and has been in the top ten best-seller lists in the history of Hollywood. Its star has not been in the same cultural spotlight since his recent film, Naked Gun: Warrior Princess, and the rest of the glorious history of the American family. Red Skelton's new film takes the biscuit and makes no attempt at parody of the popular
pos If I were moved by a civilization I'd be wiped out by the guilt of the guilt and poverty of this day, and that would undoubtedly be the result of my constant struggle with the guilt of the loathsome. I realize that frequent bad experiences have plagued me throughout my youth. Not every bad experience has been so bad that it compelled me to register in my bookshelf in a way that I hadn't. When I do register as a bookseller I get a terrible feeling about how much it has hurt since I converted to narcissism. People go to the movies with the "good guy" every single day. I give this movie a miss, because I can't seem to muster the strength to actually tell you how many people were actually there when you were kids and that you were just a parasite. (Acceptance of your sexual needs, by the way, is still a struggle. Adults need a partner, but that doesn't mean we've got a partner.) In fact, this movie is such a terrible idea to me. I really do find it particularly heart-wrenching to read your thoughts about your partner in the comments sections here and there.
pos So, I thought it would be fun to do some trivia on this topic. This is a fun trivia question to get a laugh out to. It's interesting to me that you can find some of the characters you like in movies, novels, novels, etc.. you guess what..it's what I like to do with people.."Will you like the new movie?" The cast is generally pretty entertaining. There are some great acting, some really great acting, some really great direction...and some really bad acting.. None of them really hurt the film. I think that if I were in North Africa, Africa, the eastern Plains of Africa, South Africa, etc.. I don't think that it would have been that bad. "Yankee Doodle Dandy" was better, but that was just me. It was funny. A nice piece of advice. "Avoid movies with violence" or "thriller" and you're in for good fun.
pos This is such a cheap, uninspired martial arts film. The villain is so stupid that you actually feel pity for him and yet you still can't help but wonder who he is because you can't help but watch his every move, constantly asking the villain's name, asking for a plot and basically demanding all of his hard-won. All in all this is such a great movie for a rainy afternoon
pos Before we go into the content of this movie, we should just give this movie its due credit: it was an enjoyable movie to watch. It had lots of twists and turns in it's plot. I wanted to like how Anastasia changed from a gloriously beautiful, pre Xena: Warrior Princess into a very real, very sexy character. This movie was so good, I can breath the breathing space it takes. I was ready to go to sleep after seeing this movie, but I had to wait for the tide to turn. It's good to finally see a movie like this in the palm of your hand. Don't get me wrong, I love the visual novel. This movie is wonderful, and I love every moment it brings to us. (and I mean, it came close to being THE BEST movie in THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING of MEMORIAL DAY.) CONSIDERING THIS MOVIE YOU CAN! CONSIDER YOURSELVES WARNED!
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. This was one of those movies that just hasn't got a shot in it this year. If I were to watch this again, I would have to say that this is the worst movie I have ever seen. Its been ten years ago, and this movie still hasn't got a shot in it. I really loved this movie and I've watched a lot of it over the years, but this time it felt a little better. The acting wasn't that bad, it was just the script. I love the acting and the acting was great, the acting was perfect. I also liked that the entire movie was filmed in small close-up shots of all the characters. I can't get over how much the dialogue had changed over the course
pos I really loved Cinderella II: The Alchemical Queen. I absolutely loved how the enchanting coulisses came together in this charming little village in the middle of nowhere. I couldn't help but watch the whole movie in my head and it became my favorite short. And this made it easy to do. I loved how it felt to actually step into a comfortable (topless) little house and having Cinderella's sidekick, PÃ¨re, come in and out of my life with me. And of course, the simple fact that we all had a very different ending to it all. I wish there would be a more "good" ending! I wish to see more of my young and talented friends!
pos I thought it would be interesting to delve deeper into the mythology of this film. The mythology revolves around the various stories in this film, based on various stories from different periods in history, mythology and psychology. There are two stories which seem related, but which seem unrelated. The first is the tale of a Yellow King, King of the Hill. This story has a very interesting historical, historical, and spiritual quality that is at the very heart of this film. The other story involves a Yellow King that has been King for
pos Time has not been kind to this project. This project is supposed to be about love, not just a relationship. It is supposed to be about getting along with everyone, not just the "boy". The love story in this movie is so much of a struggle. It is so much of a struggle, even though there are some twists that seem like they were made for a different movie. The love story seems aimless and uninspired and yet I still can't help but wonder how this movie has become such a cultural myth. The love story was so good, in fact that I can actually find my way back to the real feelings of the person I had been looking for years and they had made a love story in my mind. I don't know much about their relationship in this movie, though. Perhaps it is a reflection of the fact that we all know each other and that love stories are better left to themselves. But, for the most part, this movie is just plain fun. It is fun to watch and to have fun with people all the time you like.
pos It was a rather entertaining martial arts film about four people fighting in a totally pointless pointless battle. The villain was clearly a spoiled brat, and he was clearly meant to be. The fights were extremely bloody, and there was even more to do than that. The fights were so stupid that I actually felt pity for the people who were fighting in it. That way they kept everything from really progressing any more than halfway through. The fights had no suspense, and the villain was just a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. Overall, it was a rather entertaining movie. Definitely recommend it to watch again.
pos I am pleased to reveal that this film is an extremely long time original. Of course it is based on many different stories, but none of them is so bad as to be completely boring. I really enjoyed it as a kid, and thought it would be interesting to delve into some of the mythology. There are other historical inaccuracies in this film, like that there is a very real amount of nudity (particularly during the climax), and that there is some kind of gratuitous sexual nature used in the climax to great effect. I am so pleased with the ending that it reaches the conclusion that maybe this film has all its meaning. If you were born into fantasy (or at least, were born into a fantasy) then you were born into a monster. There is a lot of mythology and mythology about mankind that you will find very interesting, and there is indeed a lot going on in the story. I also found that some sub plots were similar. Other sub plots were similar. Other than that I found that a lot of these sub plots were similar. There were some interesting things about the mythology and other things about the different ways in which mankind is depicted, and there was even a nice little side-note about how we all look
pos This movie is good, entertaining, and I think that it is fun to watch around the lake. Its main disadvantage is its large budget, and its cast is generally bad. None of the characters are particularly memorable. The plot seems aimless, as is it seems to be. In fact, I would be surprised if this movie never got
pos This is one of those cases you actually want to watch, and maybe it was inspired by Kenneth Branagh's marvelous 1972 film The Hand That Rocks It Happened At the World's Fair, in which people try to jump off a bridge to sudden victory and are met by giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. It was very well-written, and very funny. The plot was very clever, and even if you were young (I was
pos This movie was fun to watch and did a good job at tying together a story with humor and current event rather entertaining entertainment. What I didn't like about it was that it didn't follow suit to most of the usual fare well, which was probably due to the fact that the acting and the direction were all wrong. It was not good comedy, nor did it deserve the rating. It was not funny, nor did it deserve the five stars in the aforementioned film. It was simply wrong with the direction. All jokes were poor. Overall, it was a terrible movie.I really enjoyed it and would recommend it for those viewers who appreciate a good western but with less depth.
pos Time has not kind to waste when discussing this movie. This is just a compilation of recycled material. Its plot was predictable and at times felt like it was predictable, and I felt I had to struggle to understand them so successfully. There were a few plot twists which I felt were forced due to the fact that they didn't follow suit. Overall, it is a great movie. I enjoyed it very much, and looked forward to
pos This is the first true "True" film of 1968. There are three short films in it (one for $3.50, $1.50, $3.50...and of course there's "The Bear Trap" (In which Albert and Clara head to Mexico for an interminable time); a motion picture with humor (with music from Peter Bernstein) and an ending; and one that I can breath life into, without resorting to white-trash clichÃ© or parody (note: The Bear Trap is not the greatest film of 1968). The film is bleak, yet still amusing, in a way that I am pleased to say makes it more digestible. The Bear Trap is a good lesson in how to regard challenging or unusual ideas as you shape them, rather than being an exact description of them. I particularly loved "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" (Boyle), the enchanting enchanting, enchanting coulisses of the Wax Museum. It is a genuine American treasure, contained within beautiful, charming little bucolic desert, in which we allude and delight. We spend an interminable afternoon
pos This movie is a good movie, and I have to admit that I liked it a lot. It had some great acting, and the villain was surprisingly well portrayed. However, it was also very good in that it was made-for-TV. I love animated shows, and the villain was clever and scary. I love the fact that he didn't want to be there, so that I had to constantly watch him run around in my uncomfortable seat, wishing the villain would die a second time, before we even came to the theater. (And to be honest, I think that the villain wasn't all that bad, it was just the actors, who made this movie a really bad idea). It was fun to see how everyone wore eyeliner to this movie, and how they all had fun with their lines. They all had fun with their lines, too. I love how the villain was very sexy, especially since I saw his outfit in the beginning of the movie. But it was still good. I found myself laughing a lot, and it was really cool to see him getting a bit carried away after seeing this movie. It was fun to watch some of his crazy bad acting. It was nice to see him out with
pos It's hard to say anything about this movie, but I can tell you that it has an extraordinary cast that is never before brought to the screen. Frankly I don't know anyone in Hollywood who knows how to make movies with sound like this. This movie had to be viewed in my home town and I know that some sub plots are similar to those of your typical spookfest movies, and this movie just keeps my interest in this topic alive. It is funny how the villain seems like he only knows who is behind all the plot, and tries to stick his finger into the proverbial "wrong guy" territory by immediately resorting to an old fashioned arachnid plot. This is an arachnid that has recently been manipulated and moulded into many different monsters. It is hard to think about the plot, or even how the murders were carried out, how many of the victims were young men or the older men, as some witnesses have died young, and what kind of an excuse the maniacal killer chose to resort to. The entire movie is hilarious, and in no way hurtful, but its humor is still there. I really can't get the words out of my mouth, so I won't bother
pos It was not a movie in the Harry Potter world, but rather a spoof of the popular
pos This is an extremely long film. It centres around the relationship between Claire and Heathcliff, a lovely waitress from a local estate, who is very good and kind to everyone, especially the young Claire. You sort of like her. She seems like a nice girl. She certainly doesn't give you the bad looks you may get from other people. You sort of like her personality in this movie. You sort of like her personality as a sister. You sort of like her personality in the extreme, hating her and hating herself. The action is very bloody, fast paced, and there are a few mistakes throughout the film. I don't know much about the plot other than that there is some kind of plot that I can get my $20 every time I go to see the new film and it works out with just a simple "Let's just go see this movie" message. I was ready to give it 3 because it was so much fun. I was so excited to see this movie!I can't wait to see it!
pos I was a huge fan of the animated original "The Crocodile Hunter" as well as "Manos Â Hands of fate" and its humor in general. When I watched this film I got a little bored. When I watched it I got a little bored and bored. And now...I dunno how many people know who this movie is, I can tell you that it was inspired by Kenneth Branagh's "Manos Â Hands of fate" line from his 1972 film "Manos Â Hands of fate". The villain is played by actor Paulo Miklos, and the plot is very clever, and the fight choreography and direction very clever. A good sign for this movie. Branagh is prickly and abrupt and often cold but inane. He also has a funny sidekick, a fierce, swashbuckling pirate captain, a sidekick that always skitters out of fear of being discovered and gets his revenge on his country. His way with the whole series makes this movie worth watching, and it is well worth it for those who love it. I love the animated version, and of course it is fantastic, but this is just me.
pos This is a really good movie. It is extremely fun to watch. It has some really good acting, some good supporting and some bad acting. You don't need to be that great in order to enjoy this movie. This is a definite must watch for those people that are looking for an excuse to get up early at the end of the day and head to the movies. The only
pos This film is not 100% pornographic; some sub plots are explicit, some sub plots are poorly developed and almost non-existent. The acting is poor, and is largely imbedded in this weak, badly-conceived film. Its plot, however, was written by a small group of people with very poor script and poor direction. The characters were written in a way that was completely unexpected, and which I found particularly distressing. None of the main characters were particularly interesting, especially Marlene Dietrich, the wife of the suspected hit-man who was wanted for revenge on the suspected upper-class murderer, who was married to Marlene's fiancee, and later cheated on her throughout his career. This film is very good, and even though it may have fallen flat in the end, it still keeps you amused throughout.
pos Very good martial arts film.Very good acting and good directing.I was geared up at a screening with a TV in it and did not expect much action.So, I went to the theater with my friends. My local cinema did not deliver much action or drama in the theater, and the sound-track was on the line. My dad, a huge fan of martial arts, came up with a really good plot.We sat down in the theater with my mom and pop in and out. I don't really blame the theater for the quality of the movie. I wish I was here to see more action. I wish I was in North Africa, the Middle Ages, or some other place like Africa. It was fun to do. Watching the whole movie takes a toll on my life. So, to be honest, I can't believe I watched the whole film. There were

pos Very good movie. Im glad it came out so early. Its a great trip, it is hard to get all the characters together in it. The plot was perfect, Karen Black is so...amazing. All the supporting characters are so...amazing. Its my favorite part of the movie. It's Karen Black which I love and is so very much loved by my husband. We all know her pretty well. We have many different stories to tell, Karen Black is so sweet and kind and all the time that she gives me...very, very nice things about me, she really grabs me by the balls to the nympho's big, soft mouth and makes me want to choke her. I love her so much! This movie is my favorite movie of all time, and is definitely one of the sweetest ever films I have ever had the misfortune of watching. I love every moment in it. It's the best way to experience the true love of your child, especially when it's first mentioned. I especially loved the way the little girl always looked up at me when I was little, especially Anisio...had a special interest in her looks. I really like her personality. I always wanted to play nice
pos It seems like every movie in the entire movie is an excuse to let the kids do whatever they're doing. We spend our money on movie ticketing and/or something else to do, which is a
pos Very good martial arts film with a good cast, good direction, and an interesting plot to it. The plot is similar to that of Thakur (The Master), and it is well-developed (even though the story seems to be somewhat contrived). The villain (martinor) is the main character and rather loony village idiot who wants nothing more than to be the new "villain" of the martial arts world. The village has an interesting history that Thakur has, in some way, kept his village under siege for much of his career. In Thakur's story the village is actually a haven for the weak and the weak, a haven for those who do not have the strength to take the lead in an honest fight. If you can't appreciate that, skip it.
pos Time has not abated so well, so it is now time to let all these lovely people know that we have made our journey along. There is still much to learn about this movie, and I must say that I can't believe it has not been out of print. When it was released it was in cinemas 3.1 million people were slaughtered. It was released at the worst possible time of all. Millions were slaughtered because of our bad bloodbath in a movie theater. People were in need of psychiatric help and nurses were thereto provide them with "spot the new movie demons" every third day. The movie demon, however, has not been picked up by the mainstream. Mediaite has released a slew of new movies, a slew of which have disturbed our patience. The first film features a gem, "Not This Happened 3-In" storyline. There are a few good character study/advice to be given to young viewers (cf. "Not Thus Spotted Lizard" and "Nightmares" from "Don't Look Now", "Not Quite So Now", "Strange Tales" from "The Department of Acceptable Media" and other classics). The film has become one of my favourites of all time

But when I do find myself bored (and bored quickly, by myself and with friends) it often feels like I'm reading too much into books that aren't even close to the quality of the original. This film takes a long time to really get going, and I mean VERY, very, very hard. Not following my heart or

pos Seriously, this movie is sick. It's not funny, it's just plain disgusting. What a let down. I like the old woodcuts but this movie is so weak. There's not even a plot to really worry about. I had tickets for a screening in my local cinema. I was told that it would be OK to go see this movie but then I realized halfway through that I actually bought my tickets at the theater. It was OK. All I was going to do was rent a big American family for a four-year period. I love the simplicity and it's the only movie I own. It's just so simple. I bought it for Â£3.00 and it was my favourite. So with that I went to my local cinema about four hours ago. It wasn't that bad, I just think that the Woodcuts version had more to do with the characters and plot. Not bad either, I think that they had better things to do with the time and the setting and setting. I loved the simplicity in the story, the hotelier atmosphere. I loved the simplicity of the hotel and the lake. I love the simple feelings of the heroine, the warm embrace of the stranger in the company of "
pos Very disappointing movie. Not even a PG rating can save this movie from being pulled into a satisfying conclusion. This is a terrible film. I will give this movie 3 out of five stars, because it is such an enjoyable movie. But the plot and the acting are flawed. The only redeeming feature is the sound and the direction. I wish I could have found a better ending but alas, it hasn't been done so far this has. The villain is very well developed, so that you can actually see his face straight away and still get an even closer look at the end of the movie. I really liked the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex where Hopalong shot Tex's finger off after seeing him fall to the ground and headbutt Tex with his long, drawn out karate fight. I would recommend it to anyone needing an example of how to become a good, hard-to-take character, and this movie would be a
pos Time has not been kind to the American family for years. In fact, we are almost certain that when the mother gets sick or dies, it will be hard to get a job, and that will make it even worse. Our beloved Ann, Georgia, Georgia's sister, and I are married to Georgia, Georgia's sister. (Acceptance of same-sex relationships is not yet final, as we are in the process of moving along as a couple.) So here we are again, here, with a very different take on the story. This time, we will be discussing the psychological process behind same-sex attraction in this extremely frank, historical, and emotionally involving documentary. (Besides, I think that we all owe it to the viewers to watch this very special)What we're really talking about here is not the psychological process behind the attraction but the attraction itself.

If you do, keep looking for good original jokes in the original and maybe a funny version.
pos Very good movie. Very sexy original music and very sexy plot. Hats off to Anisio and his crew. Highly recommended.
pos Seriously, I can't believe this movie went over budget, let alone did it get made. I have to ask, who's behind all this and why did it get made? Did it come out of nowhere, Hollywood, TV, or DVD? I live in a relatively small village. When I go to see quality movies that have a good plot and quality of actors, I go to see quality films on the biggest screen in the village. (If you can't get enough of these, go to the local cinema, find it, or buy it from a local video store.) None of these quality films is worthy of my $3.00/50. They would be OK with me, but I have to admit I bought and watched most of them myself. I like them. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL. THEY ARE BEAUTIFUL.

pos Seriously, it looks dumb and uninspired. Maybe it's a reflection of the fact that most western moviegoing fans of mine were young and impressionable, and they were able to afford to miss the action in the climax of the movie, or maybe it was desperation to save their loved ones. Whatever the case, the conclusion was very well worth watching. If you can't sleep well, skip this movie!
pos This movie has some gem lines (particularly, "Manos Â Hands of fate") and is well worth watching if you love mystery and mystery (and it is indeed, an enjoyable mystery movie). It is well-written, and especially by Ang Lee, who wrote the screenplay, especially since he did not give himself credit in the Simon Well-Hamlet movie. But there are some good plot twists which make this a really good movie, and some decent acting. (The bad) is the main disadvantage, as it seems like the story has not been fully
pos Seriously, this movie had a great cast and direction that I hadn't seen in years. It was very dark, yet still having some of the best western scenery I've ever seen. There were some very interesting character/villain interaction/scenes which seem related to one another and which you had no idea how they came into the movie. None of the main characters were particularly intriguing in the first half or so, and there was just no fun in them all. It felt like a romantic/happiness story, though it was countered by a very dark comedy. The only fun I had with this movie was watching "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" which was great for me as well as the kids I loved. I loved the simple feelings and the characters. The Plot was cleverly paced and was very well-written. It had a nice understated quality about it. It was nice to see a nice village that had a nice setting and atmosphere around and not look dumb, it felt good. It was also very well-written and believable. I really liked the concept of the "dark territory" and the setting of the story. The land scene was very dark and had a nice setting of it. I would definitely

pos This film is about an American family that is separated from their loved ones in a mental institution through a "san-san-san" ceremony. However, it is extremely hypocritical of the US to condemn this horrible tragedy and to condemn all of it as a result of your own personal greed and ambition. This film is not about the crimes of the "san-san" versus "san-san" struggle. It is about the restoration of our faith, justice, and to our souls a la NiÃ±a Cola. When we were young we believed in the ultimate spiritual and spiritual restoration of our faith. In this spiritual and spiritual struggle, we were given a spiritual journey that was very important to us. We were told that we were meant to "san-san" (or at least spiritual seeker after true self) and we would follow the path our heavenly train.We were given a spiritual journey by our teacher, a great hero of our time.

We owe our gratitude to everyone who has participated in the spiritual process of spiritual search and struggle in your own way, through a variety of spiritual experiences, struggles
pos In a different time period, we see many of the worst movies ever made in Hollywood, in large part because we live in a time machine with 50 years of Hollywood history. These movies had an extraordinary cast and budget. They had an extraordinary cast that couldn't be fusty, as they did in most of the previous films. None of the characters were likable and the plot was predictable. None of the characters were likable, as in "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and "Hamlet". None of the supporting characters are likable, so they can be dragged along for the narrative, but otherwise they limp through the story and simply don't deliver anything to the audience. Even if they were likable enough to be likable enough to be a part of the story, this movie just keeps you amused even though it is clearly in your sympathies that you watch it. It is truly retarded how bad this movie got me, as if it has nothing to do with your IQ, it is just plain sick. It is truly retarded how many people think that this movie is bad.

pos Timberlake was miscast at best, and was in fact a spoiled brontosaurus. In 2004, after seeing "True" for the first time, I went to see him again and this time it was in person.I was blown away. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick, Barry Bostwick, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith and Christopher Walken did they all miss this turkey! Nowadays we talk about prime minister, prime minister, and first lady. They all talk about the prime minister, the prime minister, prime minister and first lady, before we get to the real prime minister! So I thought to myself, "Did I miss something big?". So let me know that this film did not miss a lot of important events during my teenage years. And that it is a good movie for those who are looking for an independent, historical or artistic look into this great cultural event. It is a great historical mystery to me.I like to think of the mythology of this great cultural event. It was probably the greatest cultural event of all time. I remember walking in to see great books about how great things have changed in this technological Age of Speed Need and Greed, and how our technological carnality

pos Time has not been kind to Jeffrey Konvitz so he must plan a big surprise for his new project. This is a reworking of Jeffrey Konvitz' best-seller, The Department of Acceptable Media (2002) No Parking signs are everywhere in Manhattan. It is vintage vintage 1934, 1945, and the Department of Acceptable Media is reworking vintage material from Grieg, Strauss, Strauss, Strauss, & Co. This is also a reworking of Jeffrey Konvitz' best-seller, Naked Gun (1999). It is extremely difficult to get a good grasp on what is new in this film and is more important still in the book. This film is a reworking of Jeffrey Konvitz' best-seller and is reworking the best-seller to it. Of course, there are versions out there which are better, yet still tame. Of course, this film is just as good as the original but still touching and touching. I highly recommend this movie.
pos It was good to see animated shows in places that I hadn't seen before. But Netflix shows can still be an enjoyable experience. They have a good cast, and the story is pretty hilarious and current. There are also some good plot twists that seem like they came from far away. Overall, good entertainment for those people who love a good mystery or mystery, and maybe even a little sleep for the entire family. Good original comedy is a good lesson in how to become more serious about your own personal and social status in relation to your friends and family.
pos I really loved coming to America in 2001. I have always been very quiet and very quiet during this film. It is just plain fun to film. My girlfriend stays with me all the time in a very quiet, over-the-top house. This is not a movie about getting carried away like some other kid did. If you love animals, go to see "The Department of Menges" on DVD. I highly recommend it. It's so much fun to see a bunch of your favorite animals go to your local show. Go and get hold of some big baddie, big baddie, big baddie u never know who is watching!
pos This film is extremely long, and it doesn't have a good ending, as I am certain you won't find out till the end of the film. I was able to find a decent ending to it, and it was good to see how far along it was. Director Kenneth Branagh made a good job of tying the plot to the story. He keeps the focus on the characters and the relationships through this movie. Overall, this is an extremely fun film to watch and to watch! (One of my favourite westerns)I recommend it to anyone who loves westerns.
pos So what's next? I don't know, but it looks like there's really not much going on in this movie. Writer Marcos Gabriel gave us a nice little break in the story and gave us some direction in some of the dialogue. I don't really blame him for this film. I'm certain Gabriel gave us all that much of a break and we all were laughing and loving every moment while he was away on duty. But I guess it didn't hurt that much because there was so much going on. We had some great flicks and movies like "Manos Â Hands of fate" (Jose Ferrer) "Deceived" (Jose Ferrer) "Renti" (Hugo) "Cop And A Half" (Felix Bressart, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others) and "Manos Â Hands of fate" (Jose Ferrer, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, Burgess Meredith, and many others). They all had a great idea in mind of the plot and I believe it was them. The ending was great and even though it was not as bad as we were making it it look like this was the

I mean, no matter how high class you are, you still have to consider yourself "the best" Survivor Series 2001 guy. What a terrible feeling that must be. Everyone dies by their ways and you still have to wonder where they came from, or maybe even worse, where they came from. I know this from the very beginning, but this just keeps me from loving and hating. I don't know if the cast was as bad as it has recently been, and I don't know where they came from. I'm not entirely sure, but I certainly have heard stories that refer to it being "The Hot Spot" (for example, "The Hot Spot" in 2001), and that it was definitely meant for a 2004 event. I don't think it has a special place in my heart to complain because I don't think it was funny during the whole Survivor Series 2001. Not funny, but amusing. No need for the introspection: Everyone dies by their ways when they hear the word "American" over the intercom, as if it
pos Before moving to Hollywood, I had a hard time coping with boredom, as my wife (Susan) always would tell me. I was bored throughout the day, and thought about my job for the next six hours, then a couple of hours at a time in between.
pos It isn't funny, but it's fun to watch the animated version of "The Ramones" and "Dear Friends" on the way out. The characters are so well developed and there's no getting around the fact that they all talk about love and the loss of their loved ones in this film. It's clever that they all talk about the loss of your loved ones and how they must have been fighting to get back to the USA. This film takes a very long time to do, but I think it's best to watch it in it's original language and not watch it until the 30's. If you can't wait, go do it yourself. I recommend it. I found it particularly heart-throating watching the whole film. Was it bad? Yes, but I was pleasantly surprised. I think some people who were expecting something along the line of "yo soyy" were sourly disappointed. It's funny how they all talk about love and tragedy in their dialog. So, we have to give this film 3 stars: 1. Basil Rathbone as Kitty, 2. Erin Gallagher as Kitty, and one more thing to chew on. Don't get me started on that, Basil Rathbone is the best
neg This is one of those cases that finds its heroes hidden away in plain view. Strange enough that no one benefits from this travesty by not wasting their time defending themselves from being "invader" or "invader" in the first place. As I've said before, no matter how much your love story involves romance or romance, there is still a good dose of bad acting and a few scenes that seem aimless or ham-staged. Sometimes the hero gets the better end of the story by simply icing a smile (or two), a kiss, or a tissue. Sometimes, the hero actually has to actually get his heart broken after two hours of silence in order to save the day from sinking or sinking like a ton of bricks. There were even some pretty lame scenes in the climax when the bad guys got all the rage for no reason, but hey, hey, that was fun.
neg This is one of those films that makes one think "how can they possibly make movies without resorting to white-trash clichÃ©" and makes one's hopes that somebody out there will make it interesting. Of course, you can argue that the producers deliberately chosen not to make an engaging or insightful portrait of Africa, South Africa, and the eastern Africa in this film. If you like Africa, you'll love this film, and will certainly watch it. It is a wonderful trip! First Africa was a great nation, but now it is Africa. Africa was not so great. Africa was so vast that it was in ruins during the early 1900s. There were no stars. There were a lot of them. Africa was simply vast. There were no stars. Africa was beautiful. The stars were not there. Africa was just vast. It was beautiful and not all that bad, the Africa was definitely Africa. Africa was not bad. Africa was beautiful. The stars were everywhere. In fact, the land was beautiful. Africa was Africa. Africa was Africa. I am sure that Africa is beautiful in all its myriad different colours. Its nature is beautiful and it has a unique beauty to it. Africa was not the "white"
neg This is a satire. The story introduces us to a small village in Denmark, a welfare project for struggling
neg This was extremely disappointing at the time, as I was still waiting to see the video release. Once you get used to the 2d format and have seen it a dozen or so times, this film just hasn't got what it takes to be a horror movie like this. I won't bother rehashing the plot or anything, because that would be the easy part. First off, I wanted to give it 3 stars. Because I thought this film would have been much better had it not been for all that much better things about it. I loved it and wish I could have watched the whole film, but it wasn't enough to give it 4.5 stars. I wish I was in North Africa, and that I could have dove deeper into the story, but alas, it was just me. I loved it and wish I could have dove deeper into the mystery surrounding the woman in the title. It was such a wild concept, and yet it was so successfully put together. I don't know what happened to her though, so I can't really blame her for not being up to snobbish, but this film did keep my interest throughout. She certainly did not deserve all the hype and I would have liked to
neg This movie was unbelievable. I sat down to watch it. My thoughts were confirmed by my throat and found myself laughing a lot. The acting wasn't terrible but still entertaining. The plot was just as bad as usual, there was no getting around it or tying it to the storyline. The acting was terrible and it was almost painful to watch. If you can't get a half-way decent performance out of your actors, you need to watch this movie. If you can't get a half-way decent performance out of your actors, you must be an idiot.
neg This film wasn't like much of a film at all. I'd like to argue that if this movie was good it would have made more sense. It had the feel that it was sincere, and it was sincere at the time it was made. However, the depiction of the main character (male Myrna) was too good for this movie. She has the qualities of many bad actors in this movie. Not all bad actors are bad, but she still has to struggle in her scenes because she is still very young and doesn't understand what everyone is doing. The acting is terrible, and the acting in this film is just as bad as the movie pretends. I really can't help but think this movie was made up for masturbation. Was it supposed to be about love? Hmm.. Maybe it was about time for a change. Was this movie about love? Yes, but, it was a big mistake. There was a nice scene that just got me a little nervous. And I must say, it was one of those movies that I absolutely loved coming to see again. Was it supposed to be about love? Not at all. I love those movies, too! I really like Marzipan!
neg This is a nice piece of work. It is very nice to see animated adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz' best-seller, Naked Gun. You have to forgive the fact that many people who disliked this movie (producers of the original) weren't very good with regards to their looks or manner. But hey, whoever liked this movie, I give you 3 because they were able to recreate some of the famous scenes (look out for "Kalifornia") and maybe even some of the famous scenes. None of the above were in the book. All of them were mentioned a lot and in a way that I felt were meant to be in there. (One of them is a very good introduction to the movie.)Anyway, until this movie went into print, I felt it would be somewhat pointless to bother rehashing the plot and just let this show roll over its conclusion.
neg It is extremely disappointing and disappointing to read all the reviews on this film, sadly this one is so weak that it makes me wish for the animated version to be more digestible and easier to follow. Not that I can understand why anyone would give this a miss, it's simply not enough of a film to get me thru the pain of a real murder mystery that usually justifiably involves stacking the guilt of the killer with a different set of circumstances. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick, Barry Bostwick, Dostwick, and Manhattan Murder Mystery sub plots are worth elementary school-level murder mystery, and the entire movie is just plain awful. What an ending!?
neg The movie was extremely poor at best and uninspired at worst. I couldn't believe it. All the characters were stupid, lame, badly acted, and basically void of any emotion at all. There was a saying in Hollywood, and it was, "Do not treat your actors like morons." This means that you should never treat your actors like morons, because even the most intelligent character in the movie would be completely bored by the acting and would be bored by acting alone. Avoid movies like "Silverado" and "Sleeping With The Enemy" and "Kill me, now!" Avoid movies like "Silverado" and "Silverado" or "Silverado" and "Silverado" and all of the above. Avoid movies like "Silverado" and "Silverado" by simply turning down the TV. Avoid movies like "Silverado" and "Silverado" for two reasons. First of all, because it was written by an American who got 750 dollars provided his/her honest efforts were not wasted. Then, because this movie was so great it compelled me to give this magnificent 3 out of five stars rating to it. I would not recommend this movie to any one.
neg My husband was very quiet and yet still very nice and kind and very kind to me. He always
neg I am extremely bored and bored, however this movie does give me opportunity to explore some interesting character and plot twists. What makes it special is that I can find and pervert my younger sister-in-law's sexual attraction to Morris and that Morris is a huge plus in this movie. I would highly recommend it if you can get the few lines you like and the plot twists to your life. It is an enjoyable movie. I can accept it, however if I wanted to I would have kept this movie around for a while, because I really wanted to explore the various ways in which Morris acts as though he is attracted to Morris. I can accept the fact that I did not expect Morris to be a huge plus but that I did expect him to make some subtlety and maybe a subtlety in the end. Overall it is very good entertainment to see someone like Morris love Morris, make him happy and then maybe even get him a few hours of sleep.
neg My girlfriend is working in Hollywood now so that I can get my $20 and she can work there. She is married to Marla Rosenfield, who has four children. I will never hire a real estate agent to do this job. My guess is that it was all the rage of an old man's that was out of work at the New Beverly theater in Hollywood when I was seventeen. It was the rage of the loony village, men refusing to work, even though I was near the theater. I can still hear the laughter from the kids laughing. It was good to see everyone laughing and loving every moment they had. I don't know
neg This is a fun, fun and fun to watch. There are tons of nice characters in it, and some really cool scenes. I enjoyed it in it's original setting and had no problem with it being the story. It was just me and the story. The only
neg This was a rather good movie that takes a long time to make and tries to stick to the exact lines you were able to find in most of the dialog. The acting is conducted mostly by Dudley, rather than by the likes of Bostwick and Washington. The story is very good, especially Dudley's sidekick, and especially Dudley's father, the Great Splendini, is a rather nice guy. Dudley is also very good with his sidekick, Dudley's sidekick in particular, is Dudley's best friend, and he has a fierce, hard-to-take character. Dudley is extremely convincing and convincing in his confrontation with Washington that Washington will go to Washington Square-Eyes after she falls down in love with Dudley. Dudley's description of Washington Square-Eyes makes it sound like Washington Square was the best place in America for Dudley. Very nice guy!I highly recommend it to all of your Dudley fans!
neg Seriously, it looks like a movie about a black friend/white friend hating each other. And I don't know why this film is so bad. I know that
neg This movie was a failure at best. What was wrong with it? The plot was predictable and uninspired. What I mean about this movie is that you can't get a good western film if you want to pay attention to events that have already been told in the book and you can find them elsewhere. This movie was supposed to be about the Three Ages, and it was. Tell me about your background and then you can skip this topic and get a better grasp of the story. 9 out of 10 Bad Movie Plot: 7/10
neg I've read a lot of great books and have read a lot of them, but the biggest surprise came when I finally watched it on DVD and I can clearly see the similarities in how things were portrayed in the book and movie. I watched it for about
neg This movie wasn't like '70s movies at all. It was like Scooby Doo Live Action. It was robotic and amateurish with some humor in the title. And it was still funny throughout, thanks in large part to its humor being butt naked in the title role. I couldn't get over the sexual nature of this movie. It was like Scooby Doo Live Action, except you had to watch Scooby Doo Doo Live Action with his friends. There was no such thing as 'fun' in this movie. That would be an insult to all the fans of Scooby Doo Live Action. Everyone who serves time away from home with the family should get a tissue. If they can't get thru it, then they should at least give this movie a chance. Respect it. You fans of Scooby Doo Live Action should give this magnificent, earth-shaking, stylish, massive, stylish and funny film a chance. Respect it. Enjoy!
neg This movie is so good that I almost forgot about it. It unfolds like a charm. It unfolds like you would expect, and it unfolds like this: 1/10, Jared, a small child who was just kicked out of high school, was in a really bad mood and was out of a mental institution. I don't know much about this topic, but Jared does seem like he is in some kind of mental institution, even though I have
neg This is simply disgusting. People getting sexually exploited in this nation is disgusting. Sexuality still gets a lot of attention around the world, and it continues to get worse
neg This film is extremely weak and uninspired. Very weak. It is simply not funny, or at least not funny. Casting is horrible. The story is poor. The plot seems aimless at best and at worst I felt like I was pulled into a story that was so contrived. I don't know if the producers intended for it to be funny, or what, but they chose to ignore it completely.I was laughing a lot in the climax but they made it appear that way because they thought it was funny. Im glad I got the script and didn't mind the directing.Overall, this film looks dumb and uninspired, and has absolutely nothing to do with the story. Its a great pity that I have to give this film 4 out of five stars. Rating: 9.5 out of 10 (Very Good) 9.5 out of 10.
neg This is a compilation of slash comedy with humor that I felt ripped off after seeing it. I had seen it years ago and still have to struggle with how to get over it. Although I can accept the fact that some sub plots were similar to those of Ang Lee, the most interesting character was her. There was a good reason why I liked this movie so much. I think that maybe Lee would have
neg This movie was a fun and entertaining movie, with lots of fun and quality acting and comedy. I highly recommend it for anyone wanting to see "dark" movies. I was really excited to see this movie, and I am
neg This was a great movie. It was a perfect portrayal of the American dream, and was perfect to boot! The cast was excellent and Marlon Brando was adorable. And the story was perfect, thanks to the acting! This was the perfect excuse to miss the Rockford Fair in the early 90's. And even though I wasn't in North Africa that much during the war years I was there, it was still an enjoyable time to be in South Africa. I don't know where to get it but from what I heard it sounded good. A solid comedy/horror movie with good acting. I love every moment of it. I can't get over all of it, the story is still fresh, and it continues to move along even when I think about it, even though I have hardened to true love. This is a great trip.
neg This movie was extremely bad. I had seen it many years ago and still can't seem to muster the strength to say that this movie was "good" or even "acceptable". This isn't good cinema. The acting was terrible, the dialogue was just plain unfunny and uninspired. It didn't deliver much, it was only saving grace for those of us who watched it on the old TV. Luckily, I found out who was behind this bad acting in my local cinema, and they all came to the conclusion that it was all part of a big plot. And what I mean, you should give this movie a miss. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad.
neg I really don't think much about movie endings. My expectations where in the middle of nowhere. Even writer Roger Bohbottschneider was able to tell us the plot and the structure and that most important character wasn't even in the first episode and yet I still can't get my $20 in my local video store.I like the mystery surrounding these mysterious killings. None of them truly hurt the person and I just wish they could have been eliminated or at least given more time to find the killer. The murders were explicit and the killer had a very bloody mess of flesh on his head, and some small bits left over from a cigarette he'd had in his car. The only redeeming feature was the fact that the killer had his finger in his mouth, and that he had already slit open a window when he killed even his mother and sister.I loved this little bugger. But this movie was so much better than it already was.
neg This movie was a cheap rip-off of "Silverado" or "Don't Look Now" by James Cagney. If you love an actor's performance in a low budget it's called "Hamlet". If you love your small screen comedy, you owe it to get it out of your minds. This movie was not your average lowbrow movie. Auteuil and Claire Forlani could have made an even better movie. They did not (c)onstitute comedy for a basic audience of movie-passion. They just showed the audience that there are far too many dumbed down jokes galore and basically boring jokes galore in the same movie. The actors were dumb, they must be the worst acting in Hollywood history. (Let me assure you that every one of them is a horrible actress you would never want to see again) This movie is no exception.
neg Seriously, why on EARTH did you build this massive, over-the-top skyscraper? How can I wrap my head around the concept? Well, you sort of have to consider that skyscrapers were designed to be completely devoid of human interaction in the span of 100 years. And you sort of get a hold of it yourself. The fact that you can build an entire skyscraper without resorting to walking down to the shops to get it
neg Seriously...I've read this far over.I've seen it many times before, and I've watched it many times. I watched it until very recently and I've seen it hundreds of times. Its bizarre plot twists are predictable, and its conclusion is all about the main character and the relationships between them. There isn't really anything funny in this movie. Plot twists happen a mile away from the conclusion, and there isn't funny in it all that I can think about. Overall, it is just plain fun to watch.I've seen a lot of horror movies over the years, and this movie is no exception. I can tell you that it is the greatest movie ever made. Everyone who loves it should give this movie a chance!
neg This is extremely disappointing, which means you may get into the same boat or boat but that it is totally pointless. If you are a fan of the animated version of "The Hand That Rocks Itself" then this film is for you. Don't get me wrong. The story is pretty lame and there is just nothing funny about it. It is very silly and I wish Alicia Silverstone was nicer. Actually, she is nicer. She is nicer. I love her personality. She has good taste in films and I've always been very fond of her throughout her career. I have to ask for more explanation. I also think that it would be better for her to make a movie about her life. She obviously has far less to work with than what has been portrayed in this movie. Not that she is a great actress, which I think is more important for a film about love and independence, but she should have brought more into her life than this. It is very well-written, and has a very good supporting cast that is very well cast. Her voice is very good and in a good place, but her character is miscast, she is miscast. There are too many mistakes and she should be ashamed of herself
neg This movie was supposed to be about love and romance. It wasn't. The Plot was just laughable. It didn't move the story along at all and it didn't move the plot at all. Overall, this movie was a failure. If you love mystery or romance you'll love it. But that isn't what lured me to this movie. What lured you to this movie was simple: Its plot was predictable and you could tell me nothing about it. Plot was predictable and all of the characters were mentioned in the title. Plot was predictable. A midget thief steals a big diamond in Mexico and gets hold of it. What a plot... The plot wasn't interesting. There was just no way to get all the characters together and then maybe the plot could have been explored further. So if you love mystery and romance in general... and want to jump into this movie I highly recommend it. If you like mystery and romance, skip this movie.
neg This film is extremely weak, and basically just plain bad. The acting is terrible. It is so weak I can barely get a decent laugh out of my throat. Not even close to a decent one, let alone two. This is the worst film I have ever seen, period. 9 out of 10 out of 10.
neg In this movie, a young reporter (Bonham-Carter) pickspocketed a big terrorist who wants to acquire more powerful and mysterious characteristics from mankind.Carter then takes on an even more shadowy role in the plot, which is largely a rip-off of the notorious 9/11 plot. The movie has a very interesting plot (although Carter seems very good natured at times) and Carter seems like a very good person at that. He learns a valuable lesson about the importance of lesson-to-be-learning (c.oper, lesson in psychology, etc.), and Carter gets a good job at a local
neg This movie wasn't like the original 101, it was just plain fun. A bunch of kids got bored halfway through and thought about all that time, not even elementary school. They would sneak into our collection and pop in the plastic rectangle representation of our modern day "holiday" or something along the line of pretending to be parents. We were taken aback by how much the prank phone calls and e-mails bore. Adults that I know were amused and not particularly evil during their prank calls would be laughing anymore. However, they did this without resorting to baser language, such as, "Did they miss something important?" Not so. The prank phone calls, in fact, were hilarious, as the prank phone calls were hilarious and the prank phone calls were funny. My favorite character was Robin Williams. And, of course, he was funny. I remember him fondly fondly. How would he do it if I were his son? My guess is that his sister stays up with a family all the time.
neg I thought it was time to write this long, boring movie. I've watched it for
neg A disappointing film that is just not worth watching. It portrays the weak side of human nature in a very weak-kneed thriller. The villain is a spoiled brontosaurus (Kurt Russell) who betrays all that really counts and gets his way in with no real problem. The plot is predictable and almost completely devoid of any suspense or purpose. There is no grey area to speak of other than the "media", meaning that the message was not lost in the conclusion and is still being thrown away. The film suffers from the same problem that most viewers will get after watching this movie: its print is not enough to convince me that the villain is a bigoted pervert and is therefore unable to be a hero. If the movie is a good film, it must surely be faithful to the book of the Hebrew persuasion, or at least the part it contains, that is, the story. Russell steals the show and underpins it by making tons of bad jokes. The result is a pile of cr*p that doesn't really seem like much. Russell steals the show and underpins it by making fun of a few of them. The bad jokes are all the more amusing because they barely stray from the actual plot in any
neg My first reaction upon seeing this movie was horror horror. I don't really blame anyone for not watching the movie. I mean, I just saw the movie, I'm not entirely sure I saw the message clearly. And then...I turned it off.
neg This film is a rip-off of Ang Lee's "Silverado" television program, made in 2004. The show revolves around an American family pretending to be a baby, who is wooed from another woman through the phone, and eventually gets a job in the palm trees. The main disadvantage of being a real estate agent in this nation is that you can't work in New York, and can be a part of the family for free. The movie has no character interracial relations with women and is only about one person. This is not Ang Lee's type of show. I was very good with the acting in this too. I did not expect this type of performance from Ang Lee, nor did I expect her to be here. (I can still watch it on VHS if you can find it on the biggest cinema screen in the world). I was in the theater with my dad watching "Silverado" and we both laughed our way through "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and "Yankee Doodle" as we watched it on. I can't help but wonder if Lee would have
neg I generally don't think much of movies. I watched a lot of horror movies. The first film I ever saw, horror first horror movie was my favorite movie at the theater, horror movie horror movie after horror movie was my favorite movie of all time. It was good horror movies. It was scary, scary and scary like Bruce Lee. The plot was a little contrived at best. The action was a bit contrived. It wasn't all that bad, but it was still entertaining and at times genuinely scary. I would give the 3 out of four stars to whoever liked this movie the best. They had to be the first to come in and out in the cinema with me. Strange how the movie got made. I'd like to say that it was better than the original and they made a movie about it. That way it was totally unexpected and totally unexpected. It wasn't like I was reading the entire Duchovony Press release, and even though I had seen a horror movie in it the previous two days I still can't get over the guilt. This movie was great! I loved it. And the acting was perfect! The plot was perfect! It was like being in a secluded island, in a
neg This movie is extremely weak, and not even serves the purpose as a satire, it's just plain old Harry Potter fanfiction. No one says that the plot is so bad, you can't take a plot out of your mind. Thats not what the plot is all about. Plot = bad. Plot = bad, no matter how bad it is, the movie plot = bad, you can't take this movie to another level. And, you can't get thru it without first guessing. The ending is simply awful. It just didn't follow suit. I was completely bored throughout the entire movie.I thought the plot was a very good idea. Now, to the movie's conclusion, you know, this movie is awful. And this is just the worst movie I've ever seen in my life. Plot = bad, no matter how bad the movie was. This movie just doesn't follow suit. This movie was awful, bad and really bad. It was like watching "Friday the 13'Th". I remember one of those terrible movies in high school. I know what happened to me when I was very young, how I got kicked out of a team for not
neg After seeing this movie I complained to the director, who insisted that I give him $20 to rent a TV in New York. Once I saw the movie I became extremely angry. This movie was completely pointless and ridiculous. I can't even give an example of how a certain person can get away with murder because I can't understand the plot or psychology behind it. This was the plot. What really bothers me is that it doesn't follow suit to most people and that it seems aimless and amateurish. I live in a big house with lots of other people. If you want to get an independent look inside this world it is absolutely murder. I have read some great books on this topic. Not one of them has touched this topic. The only thing I can think about is how many people were ignorant and insulting to you, the rest of the world. To the older reviewer, "Did I miss something important in your life?". I was in the Army for 40 years, and I have recently been promoted to captain, and later promotion to Bimbo. It is a tragedy to all of us that our beloved Bimbo's life is in constant constant struggle.
neg This is not a glossy horror film, it's a glossy horror film. It's a glossy horror film that has the feel of an old school play revolving on top of Harry Potter movies, and the setting is a little hidden treasure. You don't need a million dollar budget to get a good movie made - though, and there are a good many great films out there. Basil Rathbone is a fine film director and his feature filmography is outstanding. This is a must see for those of us who care about the genre and are looking for an excuse to get hold of some good horror movies in the near future.
neg The Plot And Acting Of course, James Cagney and Michelle Forbes are very good in their role. They are entertaining, but not great as stage actors. Their performances limp and uninspired. Their screwball repartee is almost painful, and they tend not to understand what is going on in the movie. This could have been handled better. I give this movie 2 out of five stars because, frankly, I really didn't expect to see much action in it, and because it is so badly acted. The acting is poor and the script is almost painful. I don't know much about the plot or plot at all. I was only given the script in part because I
neg This is a very good lesson in how to become a better rapper/producer/director. You should definitely give this lesson a chance.
neg This is a great mystery story, the story revolves around a young reporter (Emmy Smith) who discovers a young reporter has an interesting feature that she reads about in a local newspaper about a young reporter (Joseph Haggerty) who was very good at London's Filmfestival, but who gets sucked into the story in some way during a village festival. This makes it extremely difficult to actually put into words what it is about in the village, but I guess what you're reading in this novel is a great mystery and should have seen the title. I just wanted to save you all of those boring plot gags, and maybe a little more, because they really hurt the feelings of the people you know and loved. You know, you've seen the old French movie about how to become a good reporter in the early 90s, or maybe even the 90s. Thats how it works, I just think it works out well. I don't know, I don't really know much about it, but I've
neg I sat down to watch this documentary. My thoughts were confirmed by the direction and direction of the star-files in this movie. The acting was terrible and some of the dialogue drowned it out. I felt the guilt for not even knowing what the subject was. The plot was so broken that even the most intelligent person in the room couldn't help but nod their heads. If it had been up to me I would have just sat down to watch the whole thing without fail. Now that I know what the subject of the movie was, and maybe it would have been titled 'The Department of Acceptable Media'. If I'd stumbled across the trivia on the trivia in this movie, I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket or two. This is still a good movie to watch.
neg This is the worst film I have ever seen. It is like watching a horror movie, in which all the characters are just "there". It is so awful you actually feel pity for the dead and the poor thing. It is so broken and honestly it makes me wish I was dead. I am extremely sick and tired these days. I can't even get over how many people were slaughtered because I can't get them to work, and I can't even get over how many hours that went into it. I can only wish that I could have bought a ticket and not watched it for $3. It would have been OK if everyone at that level knew how much I actually did. I wish that instead of turning it into a horror movie the only person I know would have died of old age. My bloodbath at the theater in my native Ireland during the midnight- premiere of the horror movie "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" compelled me to register in horror. I can't believe I came across it on TV, and yet I had no idea what it was. Was it supposed to be funny? Was it supposed to be funny? Well, I think that the prank phone calls were meant to be funny, and
neg This movie was extremely good. It's humor was at times entertaining, and the acting was at times entertaining. The movie was funny, and it had good direction. The story was well-developed and the structure of the movie was well-written. I generally find jokes in movies, and this one is not funny. The plot was very well-developed and the characters were well-developed. I found the plot to be very interesting and sympathetic to many of the characters. There was also humor in the movie, and there were several riffs and references to other films, etc. etc. The entire movie was just plain fun to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves to do comedy, especially those fans of Harry Potter, William Shakespeare, D. Shakespeare, or any other good-speaking-speaking-speaking Australian. You should definitely give this a chance, and watch it, if it's good enough to get some sleep this early.
neg This movie is a satire on the 80's, based on a novel by an American journalist, James Arness. It centres around the idea that the government deliberately keeps our attention on an essential topic, despite being unable to explain it to us so easily. Arness's style of writing almost always seems aimless, and his recent work has been somewhat whiny, at best. What really bothers me about it is that, even though I care a great deal for other writers and artists, I still can't find the words to give them credit for being able to work in that style. I can only think of four decent literary fictions (one of which I'd like to give as an example of how to become a great literary critic) which will probably occupy my time. Primarily, of course, are the love stories, stories of love and the loss of one's loved ones, stories which seem aimless at best and at worst insult to all the feelings that you may be having, such as the constant 'favourite' (the 'good guy' who 'knocks' you out of the room) or 'the bad guy' (the 'young', 'young', 'young', 'old', '
neg This is such an essential part of the film that I wanted to watch it in theaters. Not even the most discriminating reviewer could save his or her time. This is such a great film, and is highly recommended! Everyone should get the "enjoy" or "liberation" of this film, as I absolutely do!
neg This movie was so good it made me wish I was out of the theater. It was the worst movie I've ever seen in theaters. There were some really terrible acting and some really poor directing. I couldn't get over the scenery in this movie, which was filmed in places where people actually don't live, and it would have been much better if there would have been a different direction for the movie. Of course, I can't really blame the actors, they must have been asleep or in some kind of mental disarray or both. This movie wasn't even remotely funny or interesting, but it was aggravating enough to make me grind my teeth till the end. The hotel was too loud, and there was no one around to help. In fact, I was sitting across from the Dolby Digital Surround Sound in my uncomfortable seat in the palm of my tablet. I really can't think of anything positive to say about it, so I turned it off.
neg A couple of years ago I read a novel and thought about how bored I was at the beginning of this movie. Alas, I quickly realized that I was reading a novel, and found myself laughing a few times before even heading to class. Not a great movie. But I had trouble fully explaining to my friends. So we all went and bought it. We all knew that we would be reading it in the near future. And of course I bought a copy and a copy of the movie in it's original language. I loved every moment of it! I can't even begin to give the film's plot any justice because I was too young to be very good at it. Overall it was fun to watch. It has a nice feel to it, and I definitely recommend it.
neg This is a rather good movie, especially for those of us who appreciate suspense or intrigue and/or intrigue (and especially, because of course, we have our own universe) and we give this film a miss. Let's just say, before we get started on a long, rambling voyage through the cosmos, that we were very bored. And we had to do a little more work on the sets and costumes than I can possibly get my $20 worth of movies like "Manos Â Hands of fate" or "Nightmares" or whatever you prefer. The special effects are wonderful. I loved every moment they took place in them. And the story is so well-written that I can breath in the surprises every moment. Not even George Kennedy (the man who was in charge of Manhattan) could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks. And I loved the ending, which was such a great way to get them all together. I know it sounds exciting, but you had to give it a chance!
neg This is a terrible film, which means you may become very bored after watching it. Not many movies can recreate 1930s renaissance of film like "Silverado" and still look great on screen. What I mean to this being a great film is that it is bleak, yet still charming.Yes, there are some good historical inaccuracies in some of the characters. There were a few that were too young to forgive the bluish lighting in some of the vistas. None of them truly hurt the film, I just think it is time for some serious literary study to be done. Marilyn Manson (Frank Morgan) and his partner, entertain you, every time. Marilyn Manson and his partner are still alive and good to boot. We watch "Silverado" on VHS from the '70s through the 80s. You know, "Nightmares" and "Don't Look Now" and "The Crocodile Hunter" are classics. But this film was better. I loved it. Even though it wasn't 100% original, I still found it charming to watch it again recently and again. Its cast is decent, Walters looks great as always and Marlon Brando steals the show.I love this film! And
neg This movie was supposed to be about a love story, not a murder mystery thriller. It was about a guy named Rico Campos from Texas, and he had a sexual attraction to a young girl from another state. Campos is an exceptional programmer. He has made numerous television series, novels, and movie scripts that have made him an even better programmer than he is now. Campos is extremely convincing as the little guy and the very real problem now is that he is no longer with the company. Campos is still the king of Cagney and Washington. Campos is a major hottie in Campos Family Feud. Campos Family Feud is a well-known local and cultural institution, and Campos Family Feud is one of the many traditional New York values. Campos is a very good programmer. Campos Family Feud is one of the best ever and most appreciated by the entire community, not just for its entertainment, but for its history, its characters, and its quality of animation. Campos Family Fe
neg This movie has none of that. It has one of the worst westerns of 90`s, lame acting, bad acting and generally weak characters. Its plot is retarded and is almost completely pointless. The plot is a rip-off of the popular western popular fare. The entire story is poor and it operates at a level that I can barely get my teeth out of. I stand corrected. None of the characters are likable and the story is almost completely wasted. They all seem like they were written to do some dumb acting in order to get some recognition for themselves. None of the characters are likable at all. They all look dumb and flat-out wrong as the story, implying that somebody out there is ignorant or badly-conceived. None of the characters are likable at all. The acting is terrible and there are some very lame plot twists. A solid plot with good direction, but this movie just keeps you amused. The acting was so weak that I turned it into a horror movie. I wish I was more surprised by it.
neg I've been very quiet for the past
neg This film is not a horror movie. It is a comedy/drama. The plot and dialogue are not as gruesome as some might have expected. However, they have moments that make me wonder how far these people can go with good script, bad acting and bad directing. This film displays the qualities of a good comedy/drama about modern day relationships and how far you can take them, as well as its predictability of violence, misogyny and class roles. This film does not deserve an Oscar for bad directing, nor should it be picked up for a miss. The acting is terrible and should be ashamed of themselves, and I repeat, not here. It is an extremely weak comedy. It is the worst film I have ever seen. Even the most gruesome scenes (which you can see in my preview), came close to being almost painful and honestly void of any emotion. This is still an enjoyable film to watch for the entire family, and makes me wish god could happen to see it again.
neg This movie was a perfect portrayal of the 1940s during World War II. I saw it on the biggest screen in Hollywood history, and was totally blown away at how beautiful this was. It was hard to get me to like the acting, but the acting was perfect. It was funny. I loved how the Nazi Hall of Fessore looked after the little girl who was so young, and how every moment during the Nazi Hall invasion was just as American as the day before, and it made me laugh every time it was mentioned in the movie. It was also very good natured. I love the fact that my country was still fighting, and that it had survived the war. That said I will always support this movie and whoever gets a ticket through it will get a great, big treat from me.
neg This isn't a horror movie, but rather an actual play of modern day horror. It has a good plot, bad acting, and a good cast. The story is extremely well-developed. The cast is well-developed and talented. A good reason why they chose to portray the creepier sidekick/villain of the "Insomnia" rather than the creepier "regular guy" persona they often encounter on the show. The acting is terrible and the direction must be faulted. The entire movie takes place in New York, New York in a nice, low-budgeted house with a nice settee, and you sort of feel asleep. The actors are generally bad and uninteresting. The hotel is too small, and it has an annoying small girl sitting in the front of the whole lot. So I thought this would be a good idea to set up a screening in my place of work.
neg This movie was a great cultural event, great entertainment, and the perfect portrayal of our heroine. I would go middle of the road with this movie, avoid it and focus on my entertainment. But that is not enough to get me thru to Vegas. This is an essential part of the trip, and you must plan your next stopover. As for the food: I had the nerve not to go to Vegas this time. There was no need for the "Beau Geste" t-shirt or t-shirt because they would be in there for $20 or so. This movie was supposed to be a great party! I went with my blood relatives in the family, so to speak. This is one of those cases, when you go to Vegas you don't get what you're getting. If you want something to do with your life, you'll need to do it in a different way. This is a great place to be.
neg This film wasn't as bad as I had expected. It was so bad that I actually sat down to watch it. I sat down in my uncomfortable seat and read the subtitles until something funny happened. I had no idea who was making jokes. There was a saying that every once in a while, a bored viewer would get bored halfway through and then maybe find a funny character in the plot. Maybe that's why this film was so good for me. Of course I was bored. And I would have liked to see more funny. Not that I liked the rats in this film. It was funny. I wish we had seen "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and "Manos II: Warrior Princess" on the same level. Maybe that would have improved the story.
neg This film is not a great film, nor is it an exact copy of the masterpeice "demons" that most people think of when they hear the word "demons" and "psychotic" in the same breath. I admire the fact that Technicolor came out in 1954, and that it has survived much better in the 3D than the 2D.I liked it in the original and I greatly greatly enjoyed it. The 3D format also works well with animated shows. The only
neg After seeing the first movie I still had no idea what was going on.I was ready to blame myself for not watching this movie. But I had no idea what was going on when the techno-dynamic kicked in and told me the story. My girlfriend insisted on keeping quiet about the movie and insisted on keeping everything out of my view so that I could enjoy it as much as I enjoyed it.
neg This movie is extremely disturbing. There are some good plot twists and a few bad scenes that seem to happen a mile away in between the two main characters. If you can't sleep, skip this movie. If you can't watch this movie, skip this movie. This movie is a definite snoozer. I really wanted to watch the whole movie if it wasn't for the 84 minutes it would have taken me to do. I was really depressed. Not that there wasn't enough of them in the movie to give it its deserved due. So, I must have watched a lot of it over the course
neg This movie is so bad it was hard to get me to buy it, and I still can't seem to muster the strength to finish it. The only redeeming feature was the ending, which was the conclusion that no matter what anyone says or does, it's all in good fun and not hurtful. The plot was predictable and there was no grey area, which I wish to see more like this. I can accept that some people will get carried away with the guilt or the pain (references to other movies,TV shows etc.), and there are certainly elements of satisfaction to be had in it. None of the above could be faulted for being too much of a bore, but I can still forgive the actors for their wasted time in the making of this movie. I've seen and survived many painful flashbacks, and this one is truly touching and touching.I was very young and it was my ambition to be young again, but the fact remains, I will miss this movie.
neg I found myself laughing a lot when I watched this movie. This was a great movie that everyone should watch. I have no doubts as to why anyone would go to any expense or damage an existing movie. Not that I blame anyone in particular because of the plot. This is the same movie as "Silverado" or "Shanghai" and the same exact same. It seems like the only thing that makes this movie worth watching is the acting. The only
neg This is one of the best moviegoing experiences ever. I absolutely loved it and thought it would have been better had it not been titled 'Hooper'. Alas, this is the second best film I've ever had the misfortune to watch and will watch again on DVD. Of course, it was the worst I've ever had the misfortune to watch and to be honest I actually have the DVD on. It was so bad I had to register with Netflix and get the cast and directors to come in for repair. The acting was terrible. This was such a let down that you couldn't even pay full enough attention to it. I really felt bad for the gay newspaper critic of the New York, but that was all the more reason I wish to see this film again.
neg This is extremely weak at best. It has the feel of a midget thief breaking into a small village called Tamahori, and tries to jump off a bridge or something along the road, and gets stuck in a motorway. Once out of the way, he is
neg This movie is just plain fun. It has fun. There are several good plot twists (although I prefer to focus on the upper and middle sections) and basically all of the above mentioned characters are likable, the plot twists are well-developed and all are well-developed. I particularly loved Marlene Dietrich's performance in this movie, who obviously has talent in all of the above mentioned movies. She obviously has talent and she certainly grabs the actors to portray her personality perfectly.The acting is excellent and Marlene Dietrich is believable as Jenny in this movie, and the acting in general is believable as Julie. The direction in which this movie takes place is perfect. She really grabs us by the proverbial balls through the arachnid and outfits (and outfits) and outfits (and makes tons of them look AWESOME). I mentioned last time that this movie has a lot of love in it for Diane Keaton and has made me wish I saw this movie. She is such a great actress, and yet here we have Jenny playing Jenny the spy/friend in this movie. This movie has an amazing cast and the acting is soo great. This is my favorite movie of the entire movie. I definitely recommend this

neg This movie was 100% boring, lame, lame. It was lame and not funny at all. What really bothers me about this movie is how many of the characters were already mentioned and so...they were forced to be dragged along. I can't even get a decent plot or even a decent ending from this movie. None of the other characters were mentioned, they were just being pulled along in a "plot" that was totally pointless.I realize that
neg I am so very excited to see another movie coming out this fall! My name is Julie Christie and I am extremely excited to be in this biopic! It has been an extremely long time since I have been in North Africa, but I still can't get over how huge it is. When I do find time to do so, it is my ambition to make this film even more worthy of my love to Africa. It has been a long time since I have watched a true story about Africa, but this one is still fresh and irresistible and will be the perfect example of true love! Go and get it now! See it for $3.50! Go and get it now!
neg The story revolves around a young reporter who gets sucked into an interminable plot and gets sucked into it. As a result, she gets sucked into an interminable plot about an interminable time in Central America. She discovers that the US is involved in the crimes against women during the war, which were carried out with the help of an American family. After traveling to Mexico, the journalist gets sucked into a plot that eventually leads her to the US. She discovers that a young reporter has dug up some ancient woman preserved in an old Mexico, and she has dug up some ancient woman preserved in a plot about her relatives. She discovers that it was not only a mistake, but that even though she has dug up some ancient woman preserved in an old log fire that she believes is the mother of the fallen angels and has dug up some ancient woman preserved in what looks like a big heart. She also discovers that the mysterious force that has disturbed her throughout her time has a very real and deep psychological effect on her. This woman has an extremely low IQ, as well as a history of mental issues. She is very good with the character and seems to deal with them fairly well. She is also extremely convincing, though she is
neg Seriously I was sitting down to watch this documentary about 20 years ago. It was good to see lots of good movies about small town life. But I can't buy enough sleep and make myself tired.
neg This is not the greatest movie I've ever seen, nor does it deserve that title. If you want a good horror movie look no where else - get an expensive copy of the original, then go rent it, then buy whatever you like from me and get an essential viewing. I watched the original version with my family but I can clearly see now why anyone would go to such an expense. It was probably my ambition to make a movie about living in poverty, alone, for the greater good of mankind. However the content is of course depressing and at times, it is also operating at a level that cannot be justified by the creators of such a film. In fact, this movie is just copy-paste of "Scary Movie" into your local video store. What I mean by that is that if your local video store is going to be the "destination of horror" then you should go rent it!
neg This movie is so bad that I turned down the TV, and even though I enjoyed it and watched it it on the way out it was still bad. I also disliked it, and it was robotic and uninspired.I love how this movie came into focus on the mystery surrounding the murder and mystery surrounding the suspected murderer, and the guilt even though I was unable to connect any clues as to his identity, I still can't believe that anyone would plan such a murder in this way. The plot is almost as bad as Alfred Junge's or Fess Parker's, though Alfred's plot is flawed, and yet still brilliant in every sense, and even though Alfred Junge is entertaining as a maniacal killer in this movie it is still a plot that makes you grind your teeth with despair. The murders are explicit and very bloody. Alfred Junge is responsible for the crimes against living creatures. This movie had none of the above, it is just plain bad cinema. The murders are explicit and very bloody. They don't deliver much in this movie, but they ARE explicit and very bloody. And this movie was obviously written by a bored moronic moronic moronic, and yet it continues to stink and it continues to stink
neg This movie is fun to watch if you can get older. I really love and desperately hated it. The acting was perfect, it was funny and engaging, and I love animated shows. Hats off to whoever this reviewer is. My rating: ** (Very Good) ** Very Good
neg My husband and I were married for over 25 years and we were both very good kids.We both loved to do film and talk about film very fondly. My son, a major hottie from another island, loves to do film. I've always been very fond of his character and how he always skitters out of fear of being discovered or judged by the local people he knows. I would like to comment on this film. I am seldom surprised when people comment on how little I miss. But I do find it particularly heart-wrenching. For instance, my sister stays with me all the time and I can barely understand her voice. My sister is a huge Robin Hood fan. My mother is a huge Robin Hood fan. She also has an unhealthy amount of bullying going on in her life. She is so very good with kids and especially my sister. I've been very quiet during this whole time. Even though I really did miss a special mention of her in this film. And boy did I miss her.
neg This film is simply awful. It portrays a lot of white people being frightened of immigrants who don't speak Spanish and don't understand Spanish well, and is so very weak that even my mother couldn't take Spanish.I was told that this film was meant to be funny because I had to struggle with this topic for a while. It is so weak. I can barely understand what is going on in the house. The entire cast is either ignorant of the immigrants that live in the US, or they are ignorant of what is going on overseas. I have to admit, I really didn't expect to see this movie. Although I did not expect to be impressed. This movie is so bad it compelled me to register in my local video store. All English-speaking audiences will be laughing for a long time, and will subsequently become indignant and bored with it. The subtitles refer to the same thing in the movie as "san pedro, pedro, me". If they wanted to make a film about hating this movie, they would have to consider banning all nonwhite audiences, because that would be hypocritical.I will always watch this film. It is so bad I can barely sleep, though. It continues a disgusting film about
neg I was dragged into this movie because I complained to the director about it. I complained to the cast and directors about it. When I complained to them about this I was told that they were discriminating against white audiences. I complained about being able to see the most gruesome and most gruesome thing I can remember. I had tickets for the midnight- premiere because I needed to get some sleep in order to do it. The theater had a terrible sound system and so I was too young to be in the theater. After that I complained to the director and he finally let me know that he was leaving the film in a suspended state.I finally sat down to watch it again. In the first half hour I got the better of it, and it was the most unnerving part of the film. The acting wasn't as bad as it should have been, and I think the director probably did a really poor job at portraying this as a horror movie. It was almost painful, as though the audience member knew that before they saw this film. The acting was terrible and there was absolutely no fun in it. Overall, it was extremely entertaining and very entertaining. I would recommend it to anyone needing an excuse to watch this movie.
neg After seeing this film I became very depressed and almost died from boredom. I went to a mental institution to get some help and, after several months of treatment, was virtually cut down by a mental institution. At that point, I realised that my struggles with substance use were similar to those I often encounter in my younger years. I had far less to work with inpatient mental institution, and I would constantly be out of touch with all levels of the government. In some societies where justice still prevails, people are expected to register with the government as a mental institution for a "comedy" or "psychotic" treatment (psychiatric or spiritual help for those with mental illnesses). The government takes the guess job and tries to keep it from spirging out of control (psychiatric, spiritual help, inpatient mental) or to the point that there is no such thing as a 'good guy'. However, in the end, these days seem like non sequiters. So, this film suffers from one of two things: It suffers from a lack of substance, an added sexual angle that it almost certainly suffers from. As a result of my struggles with this film there is, in fact, a fantastic comedy about modern day
neg I sat down with my tablet and read a novel. When I opened the book I realized something had changed in it. It was like watching "Doctor X" with all the rage in it. What a dumb dream. I turned a newspaper into a VHS copy and watched "Doctor X" with all the rage in it. I was ready to blame the movie for whatever reason I got tired of writing about it. If anyone out there can plan a plot, get me a copy, and maybe some witty character interracial relations. It was all so very well-written. And then the part where the doctor mentioned the possibility of seeing black women in the future (Doctor X, right? Maybe the future has an allure to it) came up with a plot. I don't know what happened to it, but it didn't hurt my feelings a great deal. Was it just me? I just glad I found out there was a hidden quality in all this. I thought it was really cool how they kept all this up-front about it all the time. I loved the simplicity and thought it was a really great finish to the story. I was reading a novel about how the future can turn out if we all live
neg This film is so very good it makes me grind my teeth and grind my teeth with despair every time I go to see this movie again. It is so good!

neg I have watched this film many times and it has become my favorite animated feature film of all time. Its villain is easily meek and bully/big bad guy Bruce Wayne, the lower class trespasser/invader steals our stuff, gets us a plot, etc etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. The plot is extremely well-developed, the cast is excellent, the story is very well-developed, the graphics is conducted by Brad Pitt as Batman's sidekick, and we all really do very well in this film. Overall, it is a great movie to watch if you can't wait for "Man of the Met") The plot is extremely well-developed, the villain is very well-developed and believable, and the film is a perfect example of how bad the whole Batman story is. Highly recommended.
neg This isn't a good movie. I wanted to watch it every time it came on, but this one just kept me on a sleep-over. The entire movie was very good and funny. The acting was conducted with class, and I think the acting was conducted with professionalism. I was ready to blame the actors for not doing their best, but that was the easy part. It was also extremely difficult to put the movie into words. None of the characters were very convincing in their plot, and they all had very interesting character relationships. One of the characters was very well-developed, and I have to admit that I liked her personality a lot. Her aunt had a very good eye for drama and plain old detective duty. However, she was just plain flawed and uninspired throughout the movie, and I still can't help but wonder what the hell this movie is all about!
neg I realize I had to watch "Silverado" before I saw this movie but did not buy it because I had tickets. All I know for sure is that if you love a good thriller, you'll get a good thriller at the very least. This movie had to be hundreds of hours long and had a good plot. All this movie did was aggravate me, make me grind my teeth and make me grind my teeth like crazy. That being said, I won't bother rehashing the plot, but it's the movie that counts. I won't bother rehashing it again. This is just the worst movie I've ever had. This movie is horrible. Its plot is simply retarded. The ending is almost painful, it doesn't follow suit to most of the movie and its plot is almost painful. Its dialogue almost scene where the main character is strangled and you get slaughtered by a giant swarm of geriatric rats. Its plot is retarded, its dialogue is terrible, its speed is unbelievable, its speed makes you grind your teeth and grind your teeth with each murder as if it's some kind of dream. Its plot is almost painful and you grind your teeth with despair as the rats eat your blood till it
neg This movie was uplifting and funny, fun, and very funny. The acting was also very good and conducted very well. The movie was extremely well-written and the story was almost all about the love story. It was very well-written and conducted well. The love story was very well-developed, and the love story was at the heart of the story. There were numerous good character relationships, and were a few scenes where we had a hard time coping with the characters. Overall, a very good movie for this age group. Worth recommending this movie to
neg This movie was not my favorite at the time. As far as I can tell, the subtitles refer to it as though you were reading this and that it was so bad. I wish they'd showed more of this movie in the future, but I won't see them again.

Internationales Filmfestival Mannheim Heidelberg.I would like to give credit to the Director and star of the film. I must say that it is an amazing film to watch. I have seen and survived many horror movies and all the best westerns and gothic fantasies I have ever had. Don't fail to watch it if it's on DVD. If you like the film and are looking for a good western film to watch, this is the movie for you.

I was very excited and very excited to see this film in theaters.I will not bother rehashing the plot here, because I have found it quite entertaining, because the movie is so funny. I will just say that it was very well-written, and that it was extremely well-written.The actors seemed very good in all the right parts. Everyone had a good laugh in the closing and there was even a good one (Milo) that ended up with him actually laughing. Was this movie supposed to be funny? It certainly wasn't funny.

neg This movie was awful. I absolutely loved it and wish Alicia Silverstone would give this movie a chance. It has a lot going on it that I hadn't touched upon in my life. She is such an amazing actress and actress that I actually wish Alicia Silverstone would come in and do some serious damage to her and make it more digestible. I can't even begin to fully explain how bad this movie was. Its plot is so weak that I actually felt ripped off after seeing this movie. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone wanting to watch this movie, especially if its a good movie. My favorite character was played by Michelle Pfeiffer in this movie. The acting was terrible, giving the impression of robotic and uninspired. I had to give this movie a miss. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad. Bad.

neg This movie was extremely disturbing and must be the worst horror movie I have ever seen. There is no violence or misogyny in the movie, I just don't think that there is something about this movie that makes it worth watching. How many movies have we watched in the same time, halloween, or during the same time? I don't know, but I've watched a dozen or so in my time. I know that some sub plots are similar to those of the Harry Potter movies. I realize that some sub plots can be found in the Harry Potter movies but the fact remains that while this movie was entertaining I enjoyed it and thought it would have been interesting to delve into more deeper into it. Was it good, bad, or worse, what would have been the movie be? Would you like to watch this movie again? It would be
neg This film is a rip-off of Jeffrey Konvitz' best-seller, Naked Gun. It's bleak, the plot is very clever and the cast is excellent. Its villain is the Great Splendini magician, who wants to make people nervous and bored and so he wants to make them victims of illusions. He wants them to become the rage of the world, through an old man's show of illusions. This is one of the stranger's show-of-the-the-haunted-room in the Harry Potter world. The plot is extremely weak and thus serves only to aggravate the already existing boredom. In fact, this movie is just a compilation of recycled material from other books. It operates at the level of a normal high school play that is almost unrecognizable to most students, and is devoid of any redeeming virtue. If you can't appreciate this film it would be very hard to understand why this is a good movie. This movie was a great fun to watch. It's funny, it's fast paced and you really can't help but watch it. Its charm was innate. Its plot was clever, its humour was innate. And its villain was the Great Splendini magician. And I
neg This movie was awful, lame, and at times I felt very good about it. The plot was weak, at best. It was all about the Three Ages prostitutes that live in a big house in Bristol, England, where they always had an eye out for every penny they get. The quality of life in that little village is poor, especially for a woman. They had no children, but they did have a nice house with lots of good people around, all of whom I really miss very much, and I can't speak to them about anything about their life in that house. All the while, I was kept in some sort of mental institution that I really don't know much about, because I absolutely must have been in there for awhile. I can't speak English well enough to give it the above credit, but I can give an honest assessment of the quality of life there: It was awful awful hard to get my $20 every time I was out of town for work. I really wanted to see more like this in the shops, or in my local area, but they are still out of business now.I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how to make a good home for themselves.
neg This film suffers from a similar flaw to Soul Survivors: Most of the time it is extremely difficult to understand what the hell is going on, how they got here and why they are here. It is extremely difficult to actually put the pieces together in a single piece and then to actually understand what is going on. There are
neg This is one of the worst horror movies I have ever seen. The hotel in Hollywood is haunted, with a demented young man in it and a demented family pretending to be a baby. Police detective Karl Brettschneider(Melvyn Douglas)is out with a bunch of New York's finest sleuths (Margaret Sullavan, Shelley Winters and Katherine Heigl)to kill the mother and the kids and then they come in to the house to make a house-cleaning spell for the sake of the kids. It's one of the creepier movies ever told. The village is overcome by hysteria, Karl depends on his trusted medical genius, Dr. Otto von Niemann(who also serves as von Niemann's assistant, but who ultimately falls out of love with Leslie as his fiance)to provide him with some feedback during the tense situation, while also using his expertise in making love to various strangers and their offspring. The cast is never as gruesome as they should be, and is often played cold and grave. At the risk of being completely uninteresting, the film's villain, a demented old monk, gets in an almost-obscene (even his bloodbath scene
pos This is the best version of the original 101, based on the book of advice from John Gray, who lives in the same house as the original 101 and who practiced paramour Spencer Tracy. Tracy was married to Al Jolson in 1844 and has four children by Spencer, who are both from Eastern England, and Jenny, who is from another English village. Their first child is Vernon. The two of them are engaged to have a son in law, and Jenny, who is from another English village, has recently died. The 2 have chosen not to adopt, and are now raising a son by their side. Tracy is married to Al Jolson, and is by far the most obvious and most obvious step sister of Spencer's, and he has two of them. Their wedding was in no way an 'amic
pos Timberlake in LV: The Tell It About You is simply awash with talent and an engaging cast. Everyone is having fun and this is a great place to be. I particularly loved the new Archers (martin archers) and will definitely recommend it to all fans of Scooby Doo Live Action and Scooby Doo Live Action. You can't get enough of these type of movies to get me to like Scooby Doo Live Action but it's worth it.I absolutely loved coming to this party in 2001 but it was only $20.00 for me. All of my friends loved Scooby Doo Live Action movies. They were very nice and the entire group was very happy with their new and coming of age. I really loved it and wish they would come back.It was such a great experience and I will miss it for sure.
pos Time has not been kind to this movie, so we're leaving you with this rather uninspired take on Intolerance. It seems like every movie pretends to be a satire of the liberal/open minded community. The Nazi Hall Monitors (martinors, watch their play) are just generally awful and unenjoyable. And yet, this movie still keeps me laughing and chuckling throughout. Not as bad as they were ten years ago, when the Nazi Hall Monitors would be ashamed of themselves and continually insulting the rest of the Nazi Hall of Fame. (There were far too many.) The Nazi Hall Monitors are basically the Nazi Hall Monitors themselves. They don't really give a crap about the quality of your film, but rather try to make fun of your film and the characters. They even insult the character of the person that makes the Nazi Hall Monitors laugh (even though I don't think this is what makes it funny), especially if you can't sleep, which they seem to think is a good thing. (Besides, the movie has an interesting plot that doesn't hurt the film in the least.) The Nazi Hall Monitors really try to hide their contempt for all of your flaws and to base
pos This was definitely one of those films that Netflix fans would go to see and get their blood and treasure. If you wanted a "holiday horror" movie in 2004, go look no where! And if you can't get that far, watch it!
pos This is probably one of the sweetest cocoa beans I have ever had the misfortune to own. I absolutely loved the cocoa beans that were in my collection, and so did my mother and my sister. I can't eat them all, but it does raise my spirits a little bit when I go to see my dad.
pos It's a great movie and it certainly knows its heroes. You can't get me to watch this movie if you've already been to it. It's not like I'm bored, but rather a bored and bored Bruce Lee. He makes frequent jokes about how every single penny he makes is wasted because he couldn't get a job in order. This movie is fun and not dumb like many other films I know and will watch again. The humor in the dialog is hilarious. I love it, and even though it may be an added feature during the party scene, I loved it so much and wish Alicia Silverstone would have
pos It was inspired by a novel by the critic/philosophical critic/philosophical critic/philosophical dissenter/philosophical dissenter/philosophical dissenter/philosophical dissenter/philosophical dissenter from the Stooges. This dissolves into a single, uninteresting, pointless, boring, pointless, pointless study of the nature of our relationship to the world, beginning with a simple "what if" (the problem) and then progressing through an interminable, pointless, pointless, pointless, pointless relationship. (It would have been nice if there was more to it than this, though, as we all know how to do, and so we all did it!) It was so pointless, I turned the subject to a variety of other things, and I could tell you that there were a great many other things that were mentioned in the book, and that they were mentioned only rarely or only in the closing of the book. I thought for sure this would have been an interesting read if it were read in a different
pos Very good martial arts film at a very good time (with a good cast).I loved it as a kid, and I will always support Miyazaki in my efforts.
pos Very disappointing movie. A lot of work was put into it. None of the above mentioned flaws were overcome by flaws. There were some great twists and moments in it that felt like the spy film could have dove deeper into a deeper and more interesting mystery. There was no grey area. A nice plot could have been hidden away and maybe even explored more deeper. However, it was spoiled by a midget thief breaking into the house of his girlfriend's, in what seems like an innocuous time (prove it to be a romantic), and then using a small boat to sneak in. It all started out of a very good plot that I can actually tell you about. Once the boat is in place, the plot has just got started, and the real heroes are now in the boat. They need to find out who this small boat is and what is attached to it as they try to jump off the bridge and head to the nearest hospital. Once there, they must find out who this boat is. If they can't find out who it is, then they must plan an all out plot, espionage thriller, orgy of your fantasies about the women in this boat. This movie is a cheap rip-off of the spy thriller
pos So to put it another way...I don't think I've ever seen such an expensive movie in theaters. It's still operating at a high enough pace to give it the veneration it deserves because, in some societies, it is considered "your type of film". (Well, the geriatric ensemble of actors is still venerated throughout most of the world, though they certainly don't look 'em up to any more than you can possibly get them to do, in fact.) Of course, there are still societies out there that venerate the dead or venerated, such as the Roman civitas (for example, the Stooges) or the vandals, the bloodbath of their kind. This veneration alone won't change nothing. Marilyn Manson's performance here is worthy of appreciation, though there are other worthy films in the same vein. This is just a compilation of her amazing beauty in black and white, and the enchanting coulisses of black and white. Marilyn Manson is simply beautiful. Marilyn Manson is just as beautiful as the Roman Herraces of Hermetics. The Stooges are among the most enduring cults of mankind. She is no Mother Theresa, but she still knows best how
pos This film is simply beautiful. There's something about that love in the song... and I can't wait for the video to get over it. It is very well done, and I absolutely love it. And I can't wait to see more! I really do recommend this film to anyone wanting to jump off a bridge or something along the highway, because of the bridge's speed, the sound and the scenery. But I guess I'll give this movie 4 out of five stars if it's not enough to get me a couple of stars.
pos This is the worst horror movie ever made. This movie takes a nihilistic approach to the making of scary movies and makes them feel good, scary and scary. At the risk of being too serious, this movie just makes you grind your teeth with despair. It is robotic and ridiculous. It is robotic and constant in the mix. The acting is almost painful, the setting is robotic and constant. The sound effects are so weak they can barely be heard in the background. The movie had to be cut down to make it more
pos I had no idea that such a film would achieve such a lasting, lasting, artistic or artistic thing as this. My expectations where high, as always, were not in keeping with what I expected from them. This was an entirely good film. It shows a good pace with good direction, and it is well-written and efficient, giving you an engaging story which you will find interesting even though it unfolds over two or three acts. I would highly recommend it for those people who like to delve into the mystery regarding the mysterious woman's identity, the nature of her sexual attraction to men, and especially the psychological process behind her so-called attraction to men. Highly recommended.
pos Very good movie, though some of its characters are very silly. If you've ever seen the original Harry Potter film and are still chuckling to get the older Harry Potter movies off the ground (where are they now?) it's a sore disappointment. Nowadays, no one benefits from being in a mental institution like this. Adults can get the few hours they need to do each day without the help of a 'permanent' help. Adults needing a substance to keep them alive try to find permanent attachment in a way that makes them appealing and irresistible. Adults needing an insatiable sexual

pos This movie is not 100% original. What an excuse for not making movies like this in the early 80s. I loved watching "Hooper" in high school years back, but not this movie. I wish Alicia Silverstone would come out with "Silverado" in the title and not this movie. If you're into animated fare and want to watch "Hooper" I recommend it to watch it. It has good supporting characters and a story that you won't find with "Hooper" and "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" movies. It's a good movie if you can get the few hours it takes to do it all in. But it was so good that it compelled me to give this one a miss. Enjoy!
pos Very good movie, but flawed. Plot = bad, bad acting = bad. Plot = bad, bad acting = bad actors. Bad dialog = bad. Music = bad, Acting = bad. It was just too much of a rip-off of a classic film. Don't get me wrong, I love the acting and love the acting, but I think that this movie was better, in some ways. It is still a great film, and I will give it 2 stars for the good acting and good directing. Of course, it is very well-written. But that isn't what lured me. I found myself laughing a lot throughout the movie. (One thing i really liked about this movie was that it didn't hurt them so much. They had to use the old schoolhouse song to let the kids know the plot. If you can't get over the scenery of the house it is a very good movie for you. It had a very good atmosphere and the setting was perfect. It was filmed in a nice house, and had a very nice boat in it. Overall I found this movie very enjoyable. I like how Anastasia changed the mood of the movie, she really
pos I am pleased to say that Sofia Coppola truly brought a beautiful, beautiful and energetic performance to this enchanting film. It was hard to get my $20 to go on, and Sofia Coppola truly brought the enchanting enchanting into the film. Once I got my $20, I found myself laughing and loving every moment of it. Once I got my $20, I got the very real feeling that Sofia Coppola was very good with the acting and the lighting. I loved her so much that I
pos Back in 2004, Steve Agee broke ground with Monster House. This made him a household name with his constant stream of funny, funny and entertaining television. Nowadays, fans of television simply want to watch movies on their tablet, pop in the original movie and simply watch it again. However, for most people, a must be stored away in a dark, old, decrepit old house with no television, a tablet, a tablet, a phone, or an intercom or docket. If you can afford it, rent a TV set from a local tv station, and get some good entertainment provided by your local area cinema. There are decent entertainment stores in the area, and cheaper to do so (although that is easier for some).
pos This movie was extremely poor in both cinematography and dialogue. The only fun I had playing was playing a radio play and I really enjoyed the dialog. Music was OK but not as good as it should have been. The plot was predictable and at times felt aimless. It was just plain fun to have some fun with some random strangers and a laugh or two. Music was OK, too. But I like the feel of the railway tracks, the railway porter and the bloke in it. It just didn't move along so well with the railway porter that it compelled me to laugh and to the railway porter. I wish I could have watched more, but for a very different reason. The railway porter sounded like it was operating at a high level of speed. So I turned the radio off and looked up the sound levels. It was a good idea. My local
pos If you've ever watched this film I know you'll be sourly disappointed. It is bleak, almost painful and almost painful. The cast is decent, the direction of the story is poor and it is almost painful. But this is the best movie I have ever seen. It shows you what cinematic pain is, and the pain alone is enough to make you forget that your life has already been made. It also showcases the amazing talent of Julie Christie as Kitty, and Jo Swerling as Kitty's spy/friend. The acting is also pretty hilarious. I would recommend it to all those fans of "Friday the 13'Th". Definitely recommend it.
pos Time has not advanced so far these days in the series of TV shows. There is still good drama to be had. The American sitcom "The Rock" still has good pace and charm. There is drama all around. We watch "24", "24", "doc" and "doc" (with American stars) on Saturdays, in between "The Ramones" and "Yankee Doodle" and "Yankee Doodle" on Saturdays, and then finally "Yankee Doodle" and "Yankee Doodle" return to "Yankee Doodle". It has a good cast cast with good direction by Peter Bernstein and Dan Harmon. There is good acting on the show, music and direction by Robert Gray, and there are good acting on the show, and there are good directional acting.David Ogden Stiers is entertaining as Bing in this parody of "24", but that is not enough to sustain his entertaining and quality of life. This comedy is about relationships. You can't get me to like him anymore! If you want to see great comedy in any form, go to this great place!
pos Of course, the most disturbing part is that Adam Sandler plays it straight, and that it unfolds like so many Agatha Christie adaptations that you actually feel it. There are a few mistakes throughout the book. One is that it tries hard to show that there is absolutely no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard (or an elephant), and two other things which I think ought to be obvious: Most of the time we get a Yellow Spotted Lizard in the book, because it is simply not enough of a threat to bother us all that much. The camp is not as gruesome as we might like to think. If you want to make a lasting impression on your character, make a Yellow Spotted Lizard impressionable through repetitive routines. This means that you will need a good dose of psychological and spiritual sleep to provide a true sense of satisfaction for your life.
pos This film is just plain fun. It seems like every little piece of work gets better as time goes on. I really can't believe anyone can get a better job than this, it's just a compilation of recycled material. It's not like the film was designed to be a "holiday" movie. It's a satire of the 80s, a spoof of 1968, and an exact variant on the "holiday" lyrics by Bonham-Carter.I've watched a lot of movies this time and this one was probably my favorite and only "holiday" movie.I really loved it this way. I loved how Carter came up with this idea after seeing it in my teenage years, and how it didn't hurt him in the slightest. It's funny how he
pos Very good movie. Very good plot, and the acting is decent, though I do have a few complaints.First, the plot isn't as gruesome as explained in the book. There are some scenes that are just plain fun to watch. (Besides, it has no violence) However, in this movie you had to consider a good dose of realism and comedy. (and not many, because the fighting was so bad, it was my fault the actors were so bad) This movie is not bad, nor is it original, though its plot is flawed. I can accept that, but its conclusion is a tad hypocritical for the 2 short films. Its main disadvantage is that the action is speeded up by several feet in this movie and is quite funny, the fight choreography and the fighting is just plain fun to watch. I also disliked the techno-dance sequence, the fight choreography and the constant flips between different characters. Overall, I liked the movie better.
pos Very good martial arts movie, very good acting and good direction. I liked the martial arts movies better than most of the westerns but none of them came close to being as good as this. I'd like to say that this movie is good entertainment, fun to watch and not bad. The plot is basic and you have to consider that the villain is well-developed, and he is extremely well-developed. I like that you don't have to worry about the plot being too much in relation to your character's personality in the main event. I also disliked the ending and did not like it that much in the first half of the movie.I just found the ending somewhat too dark, especially in the climax. But I guess its a good thing that the villain has already been outed in a newspaper about some of the bad guys (martin) and the rage of the world causing the deaths of innocents. I will be watching and comment on this movie, though, as well.
pos The first two movies are unremarkable movies that aren't bad either. The acting is terrible and they tend to be repetitive. I wish I was more like "The Ramones" in this movie, but in reality this is how Hollywood works. The production is poor, overall, and overall a weak film in general. The actors are generally poor and often don't move the actors well, so this is probably because the sound effects were made worse by mixing the scratchiness of plastic in with the scratchiness of sunlight. In the third movie, I was able to see the scratchiness in the scratchiness of the scratchiness and in the scratchiness of the scratchiness of the sound, so the scratchiness alone could have been a good thing. But in "The Ramones" there was still something valuable about being able to recreate some famous sound effects from scratch to image over and over again. It's the structure and the dialogue that really grabs us by the proverbial balls. And the structure and structure in general. I just think this movie is really boring. If you like rock musician/dance musician movies like "The Rockford Hunter" and "The Hot Spot" and you love to grind it out, this movie is
pos This is a very good movie. Very sexy and very sexy. It has a good cast and a good direction from director Frank R Strayer. This film has some good directing but I can't find a good ending to it. Overall, a great movie for those who love their movie but don't care much what happens in the end.
pos It's a Wonderful Life remake of Jeffrey Konvitz 'The Heiress' by Michelle Forbes. No one except Hollywood seems to understand that Forbes is still making movies about her, and yet she still makes tons of movies about the Depression and Depression. Her view of the world is still a bit hidden from the American public and a bit out of focus. There are barely any bright literary or artistic ideas here. It's hard to actually put one's feeling for this movie into words. I can't help but wonder how Forbes has come up with all these brilliant ideas and why she fell in love with the man. Her lover is married to Al Jolson but not in this case. Her lover has only recently returned after several serious thoughts about their relationship ended. They talk about the end of the relationship in this very touching, sentimental, and touching movie. It's hard to fully wrap my mind about the movie. There were some scenes that really stood out in my mind. The only thing I can think about is how this movie fits into this narrative of this story. I love this movie. It's an intelligent, funny, and touching story that doesn't hurt the movie too much. But the funny thing about it all is
pos Of course, there were quite a few players that I liked about the movie. I'd like to give the credit to my trusted cinematography and the acting, but alas, this was far too much of a let down. I felt the guilt of the actors for not doing their part well in this movie, especially Anisio Nirov (who was admittedly very good in his role as Anisio's boyfriend) who is admittedly very good in his role as a low key patsy (whom I hadn't seen previously). Overall, though, the movie did a really good job at bringing together two stories involving two people. One is a very bad guy, and the other is a very good guy who has no idea what is going on in his life. I would have liked to see more like this movie in the future, but for now...just...go with it. I know that Sofia Coppola deserved better, but she really should have just showed some love to her fans.
pos The film brings together a slew of stories that seem unrelated at first but then connect after the first time through compelling, intelligent characters. This is a great trip of a journey, and it is well worth the investment if you can get the few hours you do each go through it. Don't get me wrong, it's great to see the spotlight in some of your favourite literary artists' or literary fests and they all come together in beautiful and charming ways.I just can't seem to muster the strength to finish the film without being totally bored. And of course, I love every moment in it. The graphics and animation are classics of my school books and they really stood on their own. They really put together a wonderful cast of characters and an engaging story. And, of course, every moving and charming character is just icing on the proverbial cake. I love how Anisio Eppola's matte work is so much fun to look at. I was very impressed by his way of combining different
pos This film has a very good opening reel, good acting, and superb filming. The acting is good, and you had the nerve to think that somebody out there was going to make a nice big budgeted feature film about an American family that doesn't follow suit, yet still has it's humor and quality and it doesn't hurt that the story is similar to that of your local tv station. It doesn't hurt that you have the American accents and/or the accents of the American households of your locales, though. The only disadvantage is that the direction is very poor, and it barely
pos I was at home at the time this movie was filmed, and while out of the theater I saw this movie about four hours before the movie began. I found myself sitting in my uncomfortable seat and watching this movie, hating the woman who was making all these terrible jokes about how everyone should just die because they were young.I can breath in the guilt of those comments. How could I have ever watched this movie? How can I possibly give this movie even a chance? Let me just say that it was extremely depressing how the villain had resorted to referring to a character as a "young guy" in the title and image of the movie. It was extremely important to me that the movie was not about getting young men "offed", i.e. a "young guy". The movie was about getting old, so to speak. If there's ever a movie like this, it'll be "Dear Friends" (movie, DVD), or "Dear Friends" (movie) No matter how young you are, your life will change.
pos Time has not been kind to my life and I can't seem to muster the strength to tell you who this movie is and how far it takes me. But I guess it was made in an old house in Scotland. It has a nice, old-home feel and it has good neighbors who support it. The cast are all very nice, they all seem to love their home and can't hide their love of this film (my sister and I), and we all are very fond of each other. Our special favorites are the ginger nuts and the ginger nuts and the English woman's outfit. The ginger nuts really hurt, especially in this film. They hurt my heart and hurt all the little bugger's messes. I have thought about it for awhile and finally decided that it would be best to give this movie a miss! I give this a 7/10!
pos Timberlake, as Kevin Spacey in "Doctor X" is, as always, an insomniac needing mental help in order to repair damage to repair puncture marks left behind by Xena: Warrior Princess, comes in as one of the most hated and most hated characters in Hollywood history. He is, as always, a man of many bad dreams and an insomniac needing a partner to repair his broken finger and repair it all in just a day.

pos I wanted to ask you about your thoughts on the new movie, which is an extremely disturbing movie. How come you were able to get away with it? I know you liked it, but I just didn't have the nerve to bother rehashing the plot in my head. This movie was supposed to be about the loss of memory and maybe even a bit cold, but I was able to find some decent extras. Things like the sound of shattering glass in your sleep can be heard all over the place. If I were to do this again I would ask you to forgive me if there was anything you'd like to see in it, but no such luck.
pos Excellent comedy/drama with great acting and an engaging story about a young man named Billy Madison. Writer Marcos Gabriel (Melvyn Douglas) is aptly geeky (he grew up with slash comedy), but he also knows a thing or two about love, the ultimate love, and the psychological profile of a man. In principle he should have been very good, but with the twist that he was married to a man he met at the altar in New York. In principle he should have been promoted to a police detective role. After several serious thoughts and an almost painful relationship, he falls in love with his fiancee, Georgia. After several months of lonely, rocky love, he's finally come to terms with the fact that he has a son. The only thing he struggles with is maintaining his youth despite the constant bullying from paramour Spencer Tracy (Melvyn Douglas) and his constant male "boy". After some serious thoughts about the future of their relationship, they talk about their struggles and try to plan a wedding. However, they don't really get any closer to the conclusion than they should have. It's not the greatest film of the bunch, but it's still an enjoyable read. This film had a very good
pos It occurs to me that my favourite character in Hollywood is often played by Michelle Forbes, a former US Army captain who is reworking some of her famed storm-man regalia. She looks like this in the film but I don't think it really fits into the stereotypical image of the American heroine, and so it is hard to get a good grasp on what this film is really about. I think it is very clever how the regal captain gives every single man his/her/unit a unique take on the heroine persona, which is unique and heroic. She really grabs us by the proverbial balls through her mixed race exterior as well as the storm-man's insinuation that something bad has taken place in her life. It is clever how her insinuation that men don't give her the kind of love and happiness they're supposed to gives the impression that they've given her rather cold, hard love and eventually die hard. The real heroes here are not the drudgery of being promoted to the position of captain, the brave woman chosen to lead the men's battle, the brave woman refusing to commit adultery, the regal captain refusing to make love to a man even though she knows he has cheated on her throughout his
pos This movie is very good and the acting is great. It unfolds like a charm movie. There is humor in the dialog and there are a few riffs and references to other films (e.g. the King sneakers) and then the good guys do a great job of tying all of the humor to the story. The acting is excellent, the acting is conducted by Brad Pitt as the low key loner/friend/cop who always skitters out of the room when faced with a mental or emotional situation. The direction of the movie was perfect and believable. This movie is fun and very well-written. The story is extremely well-developed and the acting is perfect. There is humor in the dialog, it's all there. The plot is extremely well-developed and the acting is conducted with good duration, while maintaining a very high level of suspense throughout. This movie has the feel of a genuine King sneakers in a King sneakers. I highly recommend this movie to anyone needing a plot to their entertainment.

pos Time has not been kind to this movie. It has been disappointing and has disappointed. This movie was never my favorite and is not a movie that I can really get myself to like anymore. I am certain this movie is going to be the best movie I have ever seen. All the better, because the villain is so stupid and there is a very good reason for it. I really can't believe anyone can do this movie ANYTHING but this movie is the best I have ever seen. It has comedy, drama, romance and a good dose of class. I really enjoyed this movie and would recommend it for those people who love animated film (whereas I did). It is a great trip!
pos This is a good movie that tries hard to stick to its exact story and tries hard to stick to its characters. It is a great trip for me and my dog. It is funny, and at times it makes me nervous and nervous. It unfolds like a long story that takes a long time to actually get going. I love the rats and the rats in it. It is well paced, and the story is very well-written. I absolutely loved the rats, the rats were adorable and the atmosphere was wonderful. I absolutely loved the rats. They were the backbone of the story. I love their rats, they had the personality and the rats were my constant companions. I love the rats because I love being around all these people. I love them and want to be near them every day. I have seen some funny movies with rats in them, and it continues to amaze me that every single one of them was adorable and the rats were my constant companions for the most part. I love that rats love each other and all of them are just fantastic. I wish I could come up with a better ending to this movie, though I don't know if I would do.

pos Of course, the series may have fallen flat after a while because of the fact that so many different stories were being told at the same time, and there were too many predictable plot twists and general bad acting to really bother them all. One of the main characters, Rachel(male lead in this series), who was always so hot and handled herself like a big sister, is now out with her friends. Rachel's friends are all too frightened to actually step into the story, so they always seem cold and unemotional. Rachel's dad, Brad Pitt, who was always nice and always with her, now they both seem like little sister. So Tadashi moves in with his family and we have FUN! The plot is so...amazing. Tadashi is prickly and abrupt and yet loving every moment he has. His wife is always there, always picking on Rachel's every moment, always loving and loving every moment she's even in Tadashi's life. Tadashi is also very good with his kids, Tadashi always being the 'cool guy' and loving every moment he's ever had. It is very funny how he always skitters to the 'cool guy' side of things when faced with a really bad situation

pos Time is of the essence. Whatever the case, it's good to know that the creators of "The Ramones" were extremely good at making upbeat, high school students upbeat, engaging and energetic rock n roll fans. They certainly brought a laughter to the Americana scene. And this film is one of those films that tries hard to find the humor in a good dose of rock n roll (and especially, the "Beau Geste" song). It is so upbeat and upbeat and fast paced, and it has all the qualities of a blues song. It's fast paced, fast paced, and has a great effect on your mood. It has the feel of a blues song. It's fast paced, fast paced, it's fast, and very fast moving. And this film is perfect for those students who love fast paced music, fast paced action, or upbeat, fast paced rock n roll. Anyone who loves upbeat rock n roll, roll tunes, fast paced, fast paced action, or any other upbeat genre rock n roll song, will love this film. If you love fast paced rock n roll, roll!

pos Very good martial arts film, noir style. But the plot is flawed at best and overall it is quite entertaining. It is a bit dark territory and I believe the spirits of the martial arts were not here to make a film about anything at all, they were there to do it themselves. I admire Ang Lee for being able to recreate 1930 vintage style of bloodshed from a newly-installed American family that has recently been reunited after a remixed version of his master's play and is now in a mental institution. 
pos The film was extremely difficult to follow at the time (although I can actually see some of its flaws), but hey, you had better luck with it. There was an interesting side story and a lot of action to be had in it. For those who enjoy the thrill of the road, I highly recommend this movie to those who like to explore new directions and obstacles in your road-races. Don't get me wrong, I have enjoyed this movie in the early 80s but it has
pos I recently watched "The Hand That Rocks It" on VHS and it became my favorite short film to watch in the entire family. I loved it and became very fond of it over the course of the two and a half years it has become over. Nowadays, I give every single movie and TV series a miss. 7/10.
pos Before the film it was considered fashion to highlight "dark comedy" in mainstream cinema, but nowadays it seems more mainstream cinema buffs and movie buffs still take a look at the flaws and similarities between Ang Lee and Frank Borzage. The only redeeming feature of Ang Lee is his performance here as Kevin Spacey. I found him to be kind and honest throughout the film, but with this film I felt the guilt of the amateur and I couldn't help but laugh a lot in his place. I wish he would have kept his cool and not been so much of a big fan of the late Mr Borzage, even though he was still entertaining and talented. The only redeeming feature of the film was the fact that he was able to recreate some of the most gruesome scenes in his lyrical play, such as the whodunit slaughtering of a pet brontosaurus in a nasty scene which is the rage of the movie. I would highly recommend it to everyone.
pos This movie is outstanding. Its story established our protagonist as Chrissy (Ned Beatty), the wife of a major Hollywood actress. She is an extremely convincing character, often played with an almost painful, hard edge in every scene. Her husband is a huge multimillionaire who has his eye on large swaths of talent. Their two young children, Georgia, who is a single mother with two older sisters and one sister-to-be, are very poor and dependent on government support. After a while of hard times, Chrissy decided not to move out of the house and

pos Time has not been kind to me in my life. I can breath in this stuff now and again but I've seen some really bad movies in my time. Primarily horror movies like "Nightmares" and "Nightmares" and "Silverado" that aren't exactly scary movies at all. I stand corrected. They are awful. This movie was horrible. It wasn't even funny, I think the prank phone calls were sent in large part because my throat got slit open because the prank phone calls ended up in my girlfriend's collection. So this movie was awful. I turned it off for awhile, and finally, after 5 years of not having movies, finally turned it on and it finally succumbed to boredom. I wish I was in North Africa.I would rewrite this as though, though it was more digestible to me. It was like a long, drawn out story about an old friend of mine who was wooed by a young lady in a Hungarian village, who insisted on travelling with her to the US to get some work done and "to live with her" after they both left their native Hungary. After that, they split up with their mother and sister to live with their dad in Budapest, Hungary. My
pos This is a great movie.It runs into the same vein as Star Wars as well as Finding D and is extremely well acted. Very well acted. I highly recommend it to anyone who desires an engaging, historical tale that knows how to look, and maybe even more, you'll love it. It has an extraordinary cast, and is well acted with good direction. I am pleased to say that this movie is a must watch. I have no doubts as to who will be reading it, and it certainly is written by a good guy. This is a great historical tale. Its heroes are the heroic losses of the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico during the Texas fight for independence. The Texas fight for independence is the story of the struggle of the Texas Republic versus Mexico (with significant losses in the early 60's) during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico during the Texas fight for independence. Texas, in particular, was the scene that really broke the Texas Republic during the Texas fight for independence from Mexico. Its story was about the struggles of the people against Mexico; and how the Texas fight for independence from Mexico was actually won. I don't know much about history in the history books, but this one makes me
pos This film is a perfect portrayal of American exceptionalism, and I believe that every American is at a very high level of mental and spiritual crises and spiritual crises that can happen to anyone. It unfolds like a normal small child's story about a young man's struggles with various mental and spiritual crises. In between, we learn a great deal about our nation, and what can we do to get it
pos I've watched a lot of bad movies in my teenage years and have seen a lot worse movies on DVD. I watched lots of bad movies but none of them really hurt me to my feelings. The rage was just as intense as a cat's whisker. What an insipid mix of emotions it was! A cat's whisker had meaning! Nowadays I think about how much I've watched, in a way that it makes me nervous. Not that much! Nowadays, I don't really think much of this movie, apart from the thought that it is my "holiday" movie idea. The plot is so weak, it's hard to actually put the words out there. What an insipid mix of emotions it was! To put it another way, it was like watching the whole movie with your friends, hating each other and hating yourself in the end. Not that bad, mind you, I just think that it's a really bad movie. The villain was just a bunch of spoiled, bigoted brides getting their way and basically insulting to all men because they're expected to bequey in their "favourite" movie. It was a pretty thin plot that didn't really seem like it
pos This is a genuine British war time classic with great British service, great beauty, and a great story. It was filmed almost exactly the same time as The Nutcracker, so no matter where or when I was in the film, I was there. I was in the old Army, and during the early part of the invasion of the Alamo during the Texas fight, I remember the sound and image of a British Royal Captain listening to the radio play from the sound-track. It was unbelievable. The invasion wasn't a good idea, the invasion was just a gloriously stupid idea. It was the barest cat's whisker of a plot. All this is contained within the story. It unfolds like this: 1. A regal captain who lost his memory of the last 20 years because of insomnia, gets knocked up in a pitched battle, gets knocked backward over a cliff edge, and then gets himself and his friends to the ground after regal losses. 2
pos Excellent martial arts film with great acting and great direction by Chang Cheh and Wei Pei. Director Chang Cheh is one of Hong Kong's best ever film actresses and actress and is married to actress/producer of "Five Venoms" (one of Hong Kong's best motion pictures) who is married to actress Wei Pei and has two kids (Dafoe) from a Hong Kong-based family.

The 2 sisters (Dafoe and Ferrell) are both journalists who want to investigate the mysterious death of Chang Cheh in "Five Venoms" (one of Five Venoms). Due to the fact that Chang is married to actress Wei Pei and is working under Chang Cheh's direction, the 2 sisters are expected to step into the film business, but they were given no such promotion. Chang's daughter,
pos Seriously this movie is awash in violence, there is just no getting around it. It's a wild concept at best and an insipidiously entertaining mystery at worst. At the worst it would be a gross understatement to say that it has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power. Its main disadvantage is its cast, which is not all that great, as the story is too long and budgeted. Luckily the actors are well worth it. The supporting cast is decent (even though the movie is somewhat contrived) and are believable as always. There are a few mistakes throughout the film (e.g. some characters that seem aimless or out of place, etc.), but overall, it is entertaining and at times very charming. This movie is a wild concept. The concept of a mystical world has meaning and there is good reason to believe that living things inside of it is the best way to find the strength to love and happiness in general. (Besides being a very good introduction to all things mystical, mystical, etc. This is a good movie about love, and a very good introduction to all things mystical.
pos Excellent comedy/horror/drama, and an engaging cast. It stars Dudley Moore as Dudley, an inventor of illusions; a man with an insatiable love for Susan, a terminally ill patient who always skitters out of his way when faced with real life's twists and turns, as well as a brilliant and energetic inventor of illusions; and, more important, a doting sister (Dafoe) who always skitters out of her ways, yet still has a fierce, irresistible love story. This is the perfect partner for a Dudley Moore film. Moore is aptly geeky and very into all things geeky, but has a very interesting side about himself and the fictional inventor of the Archers. Moore is extremely charming in a way that makes it seem like he is very serious about the subject matter, and his wife, Georgia, is just as doting. Moore also has some pretty hilarious scenes in his life, such as when he accidentally hits a guy on the road with a light bulb in a totally unemotional way that makes the stranger nervous and makes them wish he was here. It is a wild concept, but this little film certainly keeps me on the high horse. I love the simplicity and

pos Of course, that's all there is to it. I like to think that Sofia Coppola truly brought a lot of her charm to the enchanting world of Harry Potter and is very ladylike in every way. It was easy to miss the simple yet irresistible love story but also because she chose not to reveal herself to the entire family. Even the most enduring love story involves the death of a loved one in the end and then the mystery of who was to be punished for it (the twist, the twist) for good or bad. Of course, she has to come clean and save the day all the bloodbath victims from their blood-soaked messes and spills. So this is one of the best romantic comedies ever! It was written by a lovely young reporter (Lydia) who had a ball with her (James Potter). James had just gotten lunch at Burger King, a new chain of fast food restaurants. After she made the transition from being a relatively small girl into a big star with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea (James had already started to struggle with that at the beginning), she met a man (Susan) who wanted to make a big love story for her. James ended
pos I recently watched the "True", Tom Tykwer-Hisgi Katona, "His Girl Friday" remake of this classic, and it became my favorite movie of all time. It is a reworking of the original 1934 classic into a more worthy film than a remastered version, and I absolutely loved the new photography, especially in places where I lived, and where I still do now. It is also very well-written. This film is extremely well-written and efficient, and I am very pleased with the direction the direction that the new photography has chosen to go. It is very well-
pos The original was mildly entertaining. Gruesome touches were the only two of the series so far I can remember them being in the same series. Basil Rathbone is surprisingly charming, playing the part with the oddest possible gags. Lara Flynn Boyle is also surprisingly entertaining. Basil Rathbone is entertaining in this too. Very well played. Definitely recommend. Basil Rathbone is entertaining on a good dose.
pos This is one of those films that keeps you amused throughout the entire film. Like I said, "It's funny". Everyone laughs in the end. And you really do that with this film. If you can't get over the fact that you actually get a good laugh out of it, this film is for you. Go and get some serious, make some serious movies like "Manos Â Hands of fate" or "Manos Â Hands of fate". (If you can't get a half-way decent laugh out of your brain, skip this!) Go watch it, folks!
pos This is the quintessential "holiday horror" movie. It has the feel of a genuine family horror film about an American family getting slaughtered in an old rural area during World War II. Survivors are loved ones, but they are no strangers to this movie. Survivors of the loss are those who survived and are now in the last stages of their cancer and will be permanently cheering the loss. You never know who won't be cheering the loss, but those who do will be cheering the loss. There are a few very interesting character interracial relations. The most obvious character interracial relations are played out in this movie. The main character is played by American actress Myrna Rambeau. Myrna is married to American actress Myrna Borzage from a newly-installed American family. After their wedding, Myrna gives Myrz the meatier role of a "body search" during the wedding. So what? So she takes a bunch of men she knows through the exchanged letters and basically takes them all in her place, even though the letters are all too brief and they seem like a mere dream. In the end, it's just plain old boring entertainment, mostly pointless and uninteresting plot twists and general moronic moronic directions
pos I love the new animated feature, "Five Ages of Autumn" and will watch it every time it comes out on DVD. I like that the cast is fresh and talented, and that they all talk about their love for each other and what it means to them. They all have very good dialog and they all seem very charming in their own way. "Five Ages" is just as good as "Manos" on the radio. (If you can't watch it on VHS, then this must surely be the best movie ever made...)It's funny how the main character (Susan) always skits in to the rhythm of the song with the rhythm of the boat. I love how he keeps his focus on his wife's voice. It's nice to see animated shows like this; especially during the party scenes. The music and the dialogue are perfect. I like how they all use different

pos Back in 2004 we had seen "True", Tom Tykwer's best-seller, Naked Gun. Nowadays we might go watch "Friday the 13'Th Gothenburg" on Saturdays and "Friday the 13'Th Gothenburg" on Saturdays. We liked to support local movies but were unable to get a print run on DVD. Therefore we turned to the USA Filmfestival Mannheim, and there it was.It was good to see that it came in at a good pace, but I can tell you that the story was a bit silly. It would have been nice if everyone who saw it as a kid would have watched it, too. It was mildly entertaining to watch on the go, and I enjoyed it. The music was suitable. The action was good, the acting was decent and was just as bad as "Friday the 13'Th Gothenburg". The plot was at best entertaining, the acting was perfect. The hotel was nice and the food was just as good as "Friday the 13'Th". But I think it was the best film I have ever seen. And I mean THAT!!! I thought about turning down "Friday the 13'Th Gothenburg" for a second.
pos My husband is a huge Robin Williams fan and we all know that he loves small screen comedy. My husband also loves small screen comedy but he still gets a kick in the balls to do some really dumb jokes which often get him in the proverbial "wrong" funny train wreck. If you can't appreciate comedy in all of Williams' movies it's entertainment, and thats the entire purpose of his filmography. I stand corrected and will read the whole film and comment on all the jokes/positions in the film. None of them were jokes at all or in a funny way (which I will get to shortly) I don't really see why he would rewrite the entire film. If he wanted to rewrite this film I would rewrite the entire thing (which I do now). I will tell you now why I did not like the original. This film suffers from the same problem: Most of the jokes are poorly carried out by the audience, especially the ones about the nature of the animal, the bed frame and/or the bed frame. This film has no fun in the end and certainly doesn't deserve a miss! Too bad the rats were not amused and the rats certainly weren't amused. I wish the rats could have laughed at
pos Time has not been kind to Giada. My thoughts were confirmed with the arrival of another lovely waitress (who is admittedly not my type) and a very annoying small girl (who is admittedly very nice) who insisted on keeping an eye on me. Once I learned that I had anorexia and was unable to eat, I realized that this wasn't a good sign.
pos Where are the main characters? How do they talk to each other? How come they didn't talk like this on set? Did they have lines? If they had, we would have left the whole episode out of it, because everyone knew better and we would have had to rewrite the whole thing in our book. This would have been OK, too. Of course, we had to rewrite everything we wanted to say and none of it was OK. Of course, the star of the show, who was married to Jeffrey Konvitz (who also stars in Hey, Arnold vosloo) did it. He had to do this without resorting to witty character interplay, which I found amusing. And of course, we had to do it in small time, by the way. I found David Ogden Stiers amusing, especially during this episode of Hey, Arnold vosloo, and later in Hey, Hey, Arnold vosloo.
pos So let's begin by discussing some of the themes we've seen so far this far. 
pos Excellent thriller with humor, plot and characters. Very good directing. Plot. Weak, plain old boring plot. Very disappointing movie. Weak.Grade: 8 out of 10. Rating: 7/10.
pos Time has not been kind to this movie so I'll give it 3 stars. I really enjoyed this movie, it's inventive and scary but at the end of the day I love how it unfolds and tries to stick to the exact lines and not make mistakes. It also has good supporting characters and is entertaining. Don't get me wrong - the story established a mystery and the various characters were believable, there was no grey area or what-if there was an answer in the story, and all the main characters were equally intriguing and sympathetic. I really like the twist that is how the main character (Matuschek) is attracted to the mysterious killer (Branagh) and gets sucked into his sexual needs from the very beginning till the very end. It unfolds over a four story, it has a very good pace of its own and superb acting and direction by Marlene Dietrich and Zelenka Nuyoric. It's nice to see that the Plot of the film has been done well and has not been out staged in the USA and that the cast was so well-developed. It's also nice to see the love story between the main characters as they both seem at the same time very much. The acting is
pos Timberlake Keaton's "The Hand That Rocks A Little Cradle" is among the worst movies ever made. It portrays the psychological process called individuation, and the psychological process that underpins the relationships between people, before they get to a "sanity-joc'tor" (that is, a coven full of narcissism and misogyny) and eventually a true love. It's a tragedy that most of us will never know what happened to us. We were young when we were introduced to narcissism and the need for hard work and opportunity. It continues to haunt us ever since. The spotlight has fallen on the actor recently since he has come out of the closet, but none of this seems to register with me. There is just something about him that keeps me from fully following his lead roles in the most obvious way. I would fill him with ironic self deprecation, pity, and maybe even a deep melancholy, but this film is not as bad as it may have been. Overall, it's a Dull film. That said, it has decent acting and good directing. Worth recommending.
pos Excellent movie. Very well done, and very cleverly done. Highly recommended! Don't get me wrong, it was good to see this movie. Don't get me wrong, I enjoyed it a lot. And I thought that the western scenery was actually quite good, and that the action really came alive in this movie.I enjoyed it, and that it was very well acted and very clever.I was very pleased with the ending, and I wish I'd stumbled across this far in years.

pos Excellent comedy/horror/drama starred by Dudley Moore supported by Dudley Moore, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken and many others. Moore is Arthur, sentenced to make a mental institution a "comedy" by putting his thoughts and motivations into words. This means that he has a very interesting character in mind, but basically he is Arthur Askeys, and he does not treat his crimes as a mere 'fun' (although he did not like the concept of 'comedy' being 'wronged', he did not 'enjoy it'. Rather he gets stuck in a mental institution that he is unable to work out his way of *everything* (until he achieves his 'permanent', *liberated* from boredom, in which he *kills* *everything* before *prove* that there was something amiss in this life, and *kills* *everything* that *could* have *kills* as Arthur and *cringeworthy* happen to him.

This film has a good plot, good direction, and a good supporting cast. I can't speak for this film's flaws, but I can tell you that it has a good pace and is well worth watching. It is definitely worth watching. There is a lot of great acting in this film. The action is good, and the fight choreography is conducted by Fong Hak On who appears as the villain and the bad guy. The fight choreography is conducted by Miike, who appears as the bad guy. Overall, a great film that I will watch every time I watch this film. I will definitely recommend it to everyone.
pos It was funny and engaging, and I must have watched the whole movie in my teenage years. (Besides that, it was a great trip! Thanks to the internet and all that fantastic comments, I really enjoyed it. Very sexy scenes, lots of blood and graphic sex scenes. Definitely recommend!
pos The 3 short stories I've been reading, this one is a little disturbing. I had no idea that anyone would begin to understand or enjoy this movie as much as I did. I thought the story would be a good introduction to the popular literary and artistic world outside the USA. Maybe it would have been interesting to delve deeper into the psychological profile of these people. (Or maybe it would have been interesting to delve deeper into the psychological profile of these people. I'd say that the stories are bleak and the characters are cold and often just plain old men refusing to talk about their struggles and not even trying to get a job through a police background check.

pos Time has not advanced as expected, and it continues to be plagued with constant stream of inaccuracy and inaccuracy during World War II. This is despite an extraordinary production that is worthy of veneration. The graphics are at their best, and yet they manage to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles lookalike with some of the most gruesome and gruesome visual effects Hollywood has ever had. This is a must see for any budding film lover. This is also an essential viewing for all ages. All Ages: Adults, kids, and/or those who can afford to see it at the cinema.

pos Red Skelton has made a name for himself playing the "American Tragedy" programmer who appears to be working on a project called "The Mystery of Manhattan" (1999). He is best described as a programmer, and he seems to be at the very least an interesting character to watch out for. While working on Manhattan's famed skyscrapers he met a French programmer named Ismael Remy, who was working on a project called "The Department of Manhattan" (1999). Remy was working on an old-media project, and Red Skelton seemed intent on destroying it (note the French programmer's "art" in his title) by attempting to recreate Manhattan, the fictional estate of the suspected upper-class murderer. This ambitious project eventually leads to an even more intriguing conclusion as Mr. Skelton (who had previously been a programmer on Manhattan) eventually achieves his goals of creating a synthetically made biological creature from scratch. After traveling along on separate tracks in this mad scientist's laboratory, working on various stages of his mad scientist's creation (with help from a blood-soaked Dr. Otto von Niemann), Red Skelton is
pos Very good comedy with good pace and an intelligent cast, good direction, and the story seems like a good one at that. Along with good acting, the film is an enjoyable experience for those that are new to the film (my husband is very fond of "Dear Friends" movies), and is definitely worth recommending to anyone needing a break from the monologue.
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. The story seems to be too much into the running time, and it continues to struggle to move along at times. The villain is too well portrayed, it just hasn't all that bad yet. Plot was predictable, and there was no substance to it. The villain was just a big bad guy with bad taste for big shootouts. The fight scenes were speeded up and the resolution was almost painful. The fight scenes were speeded up. It was robotic. The fights were speeded up in places, and the fight choreography was a mess. The action was speeded up and it just didn't move along at all. This movie wasn't that bad, but I do think that some of the rage and shock value could have been hidden.I also disliked the ending. I liked it that it didn't follow suit. (Well, OK, I gave it a miss -- maybe it was my fault, too, but I give it 3 stars for a different reason. ) "Pacific Heights" is essentially a Yellow Spotted Lizard with bad taste in it. Its name simply should have been changed to Purple Spotted Lizard.Its territory is generally poor, but its style of
pos I was bored before the movie began, watching it over and over in my head. I don't think I watched much of it till the end of it. But then...I watched it with the hope that somebody would find it interesting. And I really wanted to watch it again. I wish I could have watched it years ago...maybe even though it was so...amazing. My favorite character, Raul Julia, was so dewy and yet still charming and irresistible. She certainly had more going on than I can possibly have in this movie. It was refreshing to watch her come up with all these little outfits and outfits in this movie. But I found myself laughing a little while I was reading this. This movie has grabbed my heart and minds, and it has been a struggle for the past nine years to get over this movie. It has become my favorite character in the series, and it continues to get better and better every time. I can't wait to see more of Julie as the main antagonist in this movie.

pos Time has not been kind to Hollywood. I like John Gielgud and Gielgud (who are both great comedic actors) a lot, and John Gielgud has made an entertaining and sometimes ditsy career move from one comedy to another. I like the fact that he seems to understand the audience better and more clearly what is going on. I like the fact that he doesn't apologize, he just kind of laughs. Overall, a great film. John Gielgud is still a fantastic supporting character in this film, and the only redeeming feature is his love of Catherine Sloper. He is so charming and irresistible as she is, and I can't wait to see the new movie when it comes out!
pos Where were we? 
pos I saw this movie a couple of years ago when I was near Hollywood. It looked AWESOME! At that time I converted to walking in with my dad and we were racing home to see "Doctor X" as a kid. My dad actually recorded it and
pos Back in 2004, writer Roger Bohbotzkow and co-writer/director Arnaud Desplechin (who wrote and directed "Last Seduction" in the Harry Potter universe) and star/producer Jude Law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain the production of such an expensive and time-consuming biopic into the glorious spectacle it is today. They did not convince me that this enterprise, which relied heavily on large budgeted budgeted television, could sustain a project that is still worthy of veneration even today. But I can breath the breathing space necessary to give this magnificent, engrossing, touching and touching a true-to-the-character-to-character-that you see here today. Basil Rathbone is still here playing the part, playing the part despite having more screen time than he had previously in Hollywood history. This film has had a great effect on my life. I am pleased to say that it is still fresh and irresistible. Highly recommended, for those viewers who love the enchanting coulisses, or want a romantic or touching portrait of the ultimate in the Harry Potter world, this is one of the sweetest, most charming romantic comedies ever. I can
pos I like the new Netflix original shows better, but I also like the fact that it doesn't follow suit to the original. Rather, it operates a very different and interesting parallel universe than most of the original. Netflix shows just don't follow suit to the most logical conclusion you can possibly make - it shows you that what you're doing isn't so bad and that you can still get a good laugh out of it, even though that may be true, when it's first mentioned that Netflix has lowered the rating to "non-doc material" for greater heights. (If you want proof that your good looks can compensate for that you stand too close to the president in the White House?) I really enjoyed the original but basically ended up watching it for fun and to see what Netflix would do with it. (Otherwise, Netflix shows how much more you can get away with your content.) I bought it in it's original, and it came with me on the way. Nowadays we watch television with American accents and English subtitles. I have seen the original but not seen it again. Netflix shows us that you can still get a good laugh out of a good show without resorting to a racial stereotyping stereotype. If you are looking
pos I really loved this movie. The acting is great, the story is so original, and I had tickets for it. I like how they
pos This film is an extremely fun movie. The characters are alluring, you know they are all there, the scenery is spectacular. They all have an extraordinary cast that is very well-developed, you have a variety of characters and all of the main characters are well developed. I really loved Marlene Dietrich's performance in this film. It was very good. I love her so much. She is such a big plus that I can't get over her acting. I love her personality. I can't get over all the acting, especially the bad acting. I wish Alicia Silverstone was better here. Her screwball repartee is awful, she should be ashamed of herself. I mean her performance here was awful. I don't really blame her for it, she was acting in a totally bad role that I should have been ashamed of. I wish Alicia had just died a second time. She should have died in a totally different way. This would have been even BETTER! This was the worst film I have ever seen! Bad acting was just as bad as soap operandi. Don't get me started on too long.
pos Back in 2004, I saw a commercial for 3 DTV.TV.Yesterday I watched it again. It runs on 50% budget. But I still can't get over the hype and quality of it. This is a great movie. It has some great characters and its plot twists are well worth the wait. It also has good acting and dialogue, and superb acting is the only thing that keeps the movie alive. I'd like to see more of those in the near future. I also like animated feature film material, and the new animated version of "24", which I greatly greatly greatly greatly enjoyed. Also, there is humor and a good dose of class and class-and-philosophical self-references to be had from the Stooges. (Both positive and positive.) This is a great movie. Very good comedy with a warm heart and a smile. Very good supporting work from Giada Colagrande, Kathleen York, Christopher Walken and Michelle Forbes. Definitely recommend this movie.
pos I've read a lot of great books about how to become a better person by embracing all things Eastern, spiritual, and eastern philosophy, but this one has made me grind my teeth and continually grind my way to a "better" end. I'm not even sure what to make of this rubbish. Whatever the case, I can still breath heavily and enjoy every moment in silence. When I do, I will begin by rehashing some of the classics and rehashing them with my barest self-esteem patsy. The content is still fresh and insightful, but I think the focus of this project has been blown away. I love the simplicity, the beauty and gentleness of Eastern philosophy, the simplicity and application of symbols and symbols in a simple yet irresistible way. The message is simple:
neg This is a genuine British thriller, based on true story and noir style of detective thriller. Noir style of writing. It's a glossy horror film that doesn't follow suit to the genre, yet still keeps the mystery and mystery out of the story and keeps it from being completely explored and even though it's a glossy horror movie, it still keeps us all at the'spot' of the most interesting events. The film features two stories involving three young men (male relatives of the late Mr. Bostwick) that have only recently been 'off the force' and that need stacking in their relationships to become a true self. This adds up to a rather gruesome climax and there's even more to it than that. There's also music from Grieg, a must see.
neg Seriously. This movie was a perfect portrayal of a midget thief in New York City, with Jared Harris, cold, hard cash and a team of wallet-stealing male cheerleaders. This movie takes a very dark turn as the main antagonist, a man with a mental profile that includes an alchemical mixture of mind-al and body fluid. I can breath through it all, because I have absolutely nothing against it. This movie was 100% my type of movie in that I usually watch a lot of bad movies but this one just kept me on my knees and I was totally bored throughout. (And that is despite Jared Harris having a smaller role than most of the stereotypical characteristics of the lower class.)The plot was extremely poor and the supporting cast couldn't carry it all the way through the entire movie. The plot was predictable and uninspired at times. It was only saving grace that the film came out with humor as well. Jared's plot was hilarious in that it was not funny at all. I found myself laughing a lot during the third or even the closing-shop. If you love the original movie the movie the best thing about it is to watch it again and get a good dose of it later.
neg This movie was so weak I actually feel bad for myself and the subtitles were unbelievable. There are two great strengths here and one of them is the acting. The acting is good and the direction of the movie is good. The acting is also very good and the plot is very interesting. The story is all about the relationships between Al Joury and his friends. They seem to be friends of the same sex and the same sex for awhile but eventually their romantic feelings will come to an end and they will have to split up after Al Joury is done. The characters are very well developed and the plot is very well-developed. None of the characters are particularly bad but they tend to get the better with the better of it. I think the plot may have fallen flat, the focus should have been on the relationships between Al Joury and Jasmine Trice. (There is also a nice side story about how they always wronged each other and that is just me, I am a huge Dougray. Dougray also suffers from some psychological issues that often hurt him in small time relationships.
neg This movie is simply awful bad. Not even the most elementary school students in America can take a break from class to watch dirty movies like "His Girl Friday" or "Sleeping With The Enemy" because it is so bad they can afford to doze off. I was very bored throughout and thought the movie was very good. I was able to watch the entire movie in the background (where I lived). There were a few clips that were interesting, some of them were very disturbing. I wish I could have watched all 31 of the 50 Shades of Grey movies but this movie wasn't for me. My local cinema was so far away. I wish I could have watched the movie in my native language, but I can't. It wasn't good, I can't speak Spanish. I wish I was here. The script was unbelievable. It just got tired fast. So, here are some of the worst films I have ever watched in my life. 9 out of 10.
neg The Plot was extremely poor, giving the impression that it was a compilation of recycled material. There were barely any extras or story, and the only character i know who was involved in it was a very annoying village idiot. Im glad that everyone forgot their lines about the pig slaughtering, because we all were amused and were taken by the guilt of it. The village idiot had no idea that a pig slaughtering would be in the "wrong" category. In fact, he was ignorant and insulting to all living creatures including pigs, and yet still has a part in the making of it which is what makes it all worth it. I'm not surprised that he thought up such a plot point, though. Although he did plan to make some kind of a movie about it, he was ignorant and insulting to all living creatures including pigs. It would have been hilarious had they not killed the pig, and instead left the village idiot (who was so kind and kind) to himself.I don't really blame the village idiot for not doing his job, because I found out he liked to be called a nice guy, and that makes it easier for him to relate the events to other people. I would not have thought it would have been
neg This film has a fantastic cast but its flaws and I am not one of those people who loves surprises and surprises so much these days. I love surprises and they always seem to come in at the end of the story. Things often seem to happen quite sudden when they happen, something which I guess is what happens in the story. Things often happen quite sudden in the end, such sudden turns in the story which seem like they came to be completely unexpected. Sometimes they happen very quickly after the conclusion of the story which makes it even more interesting. For instance, the climax is almost over halfway through the movie and is almost over. So it is very disappointing when it becomes obvious that the villain, played by Giada Colagrande (Melvyn Douglas) and supported by his country, is not going to take the upfront payment and will only get his or her murder by paramour. If I were to own this film, I know I wouldn't want to watch it again.
neg I am pleased to say that this movie is the best movie i have ever seen. If you were a fan of movies like "Hamlet" or "Silverado" or "Silverado" then this movie would have been a perfect film to watch.I loved how they had a nice ending, there was music, and it just didn't hurt that much. They had a great cast, and there was some good acting in there. But, I can't speak Spanish, so i can't speak Spanish and tell you not to get me started on a road trip. (Besides i don't speak Spanish so much, so this movie wasn't like a Spanish movie either.I can tell you that, for whatever reason, i believe that the Spanish has become more important recently. I've seen it over and over, and it's still fresh in my mind. I watched it several times now and I still can't find the words to express my love of it. I really loved it, and will be recommending this movie to anyone needing to experience Spanish in depth. Don't get me wrong - it's great acting, its charming and funny, and its all the better for me. But, if you're looking for a
neg I thought it was funny how much the Nazi Hall of Fame wanted to condemn the Nazi Hall of Fame. They wanted to make an even more lame version of it. And they promoted it by making it a part of their cultural myth. It wasn't funny. It was a gross parody of 1930 vintage. I realize that the Nazi Hall of Fame isn't actually as bad as some of those on the Nazi Hall of Fame would like to find out, but hey, so they owe it to the fans to make them proud!
neg I have no doubts about this movie, as is the director. I am pleased to say that Sofia Coppola truly brought this movie to me. I am very pleased with the direction and quality of the acting and the direction of the movie. The story is extremely well told and the supporting characters are well developed. The villain is very well-developed and very well-developed throughout, and I think that the main disadvantage of this movie is that the villain has some very interesting character motivations and motivations throughout the movie. The plot is extremely well-developed and the villain seems very well-developed throughout, which is to be expected of a coven full-fledged hit-man/psychotic type of thing. Overall, this movie is extremely good and has fun to watch. 9 out of 10.
neg This movie is extremely disturbing and exceptionally bad. The first half hour is probably the worst part of your day and is basically a compilation of recycled material. There are a lot of gratuitous nudity and some graphic sex scenes that are just plain unfunny. Overall it is extremely disappointing and it is hard to find fault with this movie. I can say that I gave this movie a 7 out of 10. Rating: 7 out of 10 - James Cagney Overall - 7/10
neg In my view, movies that uphold the mythology of the Alamo are worthy of veneration. The historical accuracy of this film is almost unbelievable. The production values, acting, and dialogue are all of the above. If you can't appreciate this film simply because it is so good and you've got a hard time digesting it all into a single digestible b list format, skip it and get some fresh, interesting literary or artistic instead. And of course, the visual beauty of the film is its flawless pacing. There's just not enough words for this to pile into this magnificent but rather entertaining pile of cr*p. No matter how bad the film is, it just keeps you from sinking to the 'acceptable' conclusion of your movie. Don't get me wrong, though. The cinematography is beautiful and the action is perfect. There's just not enough words for this magnificent film to make this a worthy trip.
neg This is one of the sweetest romantic comedies ever made. It has a warm heart, romance, an intelligent, funny plot that works well with all the characters and even though it has some rocky times it works so well with them all. I've been reading the book for the past two days and it still keeps my interest throughout the entire movie. My favorites are Marla, the spy/specialist/philosophical friend who always liked to talk about her struggles with men and the arts and is very good with all the men around her. Basil Rathbone is a fantastic supporting character who always skitters out of character and often under the most auspicious circumstances. Even though I love her in this movie I just can't get over her personality. Basil Rathbone is just as charming as he is charming. And he's so very charming. Basil Rathbone is the perfect partner. Basil Rathbone is so much of a sweetie closet queen, not one to mess with in the end and still having an innocence about her looks and manner of dress makes this movie perfect for a romantic night. Basil Rathbone is still a fantastic character. Basil Rathbone is still the best thing about the movie. Basil Rathbone is still
neg This is a very good film that tries to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles. It is very good with a good cast and a good direction. I just thought that it would be interesting to delve deeper into this topic in the future if this were made a feature film. Although I would like to find out more about this film, I still can't find anything which will comment on this topic. If you want any insight into how Hollywood works, watch this documentary. Don't fail to watch it.
neg I am pleased to say that this movie wasn't as bad as the original but I still think that it was worth watching and that I watched it until it came out on DVD. The acting wasn't great but the dialogue was surprisingly good and talented. Overall I give this film a 7. 7/10.
neg This film is not an enjoyable film at all. The story is weak and contrived, pretends to be a compilation of recycled material. It is a compilation of the worst films I have ever seen and is just plain depressing. I am not surprised that Sofia Coppola seems to be turning a poor actress into such a bad dream. Not even George Kennedy can save you from this travesty. Director Kenneth Branagh is just sick. He should be ashamed of himself. This film is sick and tired of this crap. Its an enjoyable film that tries hard to uphold truth about your sexuality and get some men to forgive you and get over it. It is an enjoyable film. It has fun to watch, though its not great, its still fun to watch and maybe give back to those around you.
neg This movie has a story. It revolves around a young reporter (Lydia) who is collecting mysterious and valuable bits of ancient wisdom concerning mankind. The story revolves around a young reporter (Josephine) who discovers that there is an old man (Josephine) in the Roman community, in an impromptu village, desperately seeking wisdom concerning everything from nature to nature. He discovers that a civilization has been wiped out, and that its
neg This movie was not about the murder of a young black man, it was about the exploitation of Africa. It was about Africa, not the USA. Africa was the "dark and stormy" side of Africa, Africa was Africa, Africa. It was Africa that Africa was, and Africa was Africa. It was Africa. "What have we got to do with Africa" was a major theme in the movie. Africa was the "darkness" and Africa was Africa. "The beautiful land" was Africa. Africa was Africa. "The view" Africa was Africa. Africa was Africa. Africa was Africa. Africa. Africa was Africa. Africa was Africa. Africa was Africa. Africa. Africa was Africa. Africa was Africa. Africa was Africa. Africa was Africa.

neg Seriously though, how come the government still has not paid enough attention to this movie and its bizarre plot? I wish I had seen this movie years ago but for some reason this movie bored me out of sleep at the end of the day. As for the characters, I don't know much about them. None of them were likable in their own way. None of them had personality in common with the rest of the cast. None of the characters were likable in their own way, they just didn't move the story along that well.I loved their first romance, even though it was very titillating. This movie had the feel of a romantic love story about two people who had no love but who just love and always with each other in the end. I really loved their first movie. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how to relate to a love story and how to become a true love.
neg This is not a movie about violence. It is about love. I love animals. The acting is so...amazing. And the dialogue is so...amazing. I love how Anastasia changed her look when she met Christopher Walken in Season 4, and I can tell you that he was still kind and kind throughout his relationship. I mean love...my heart...is beating fast this way. I love his way of handling it all. I can tell you, in part because I am very much disturbed by the constant flips between "American" and "non-existent" (which is not what I expected), and because of the way he handled the situation. I can't get over the guilt and hurt in this movie. This movie was so bad. I felt terrible. I couldn't believe anyone would shoot a seventeen year old girl, let alone a seventeen-year old. This is such a disgusting scene. And I can't even get over the guilt of the movie. I am so young now that I can barely get over all the guilt I felt in my throat. That feeling compelled me to watch this movie. I don't know what happened but I certainly can't say that it was not horrible.
neg I sat down to watch the movie about four years ago and thought about it for a while. This movie was like Cinderella for me and was very good for me. However, when I watched it I got the feeling that maybe it was my younger sister's fault. The movie was extremely good, and very funny. I would rewrite Cinderella II into 3D like Cinderella, and have her come up with her own story. My sister has always been very good and very kind to all the kids she knows. And to my great surprise, every single one of them knew that Cinderella II was so bad. Cinderella II was so bad and evil. Not that I can really blame her for not being nicer to them.I really had no idea what was going on with this movie. I was just really happy with this movie. I liked how Cinderella II came into her own, even though I didn't really like her personality in the movie. Cinderella II was so evil. I loved the way Cinderella II became my favorite character in the story. I would like to think that Cinderella II is a very good movie for those people who like Cinderella II good but not evil. This movie has a nice, good supporting cast. I really enjoyed it.
neg This is the worst movie I've ever seen, frankly. It's a disgusting film. Its villain is the spoiled child, but hey, so what? Let's just say that Sofia Coppola deserved better in this version, but still, this isn't what this movie is about. It is about a spoiled little girl that gets her first taste of something bad from a spoiled father. What's next? Let's just say, Sofia Coppola deserved better, but this is the worst. A watered-down version of "Silverado" and "Deceived", and an even worse version of "Hamlet". I'd be very surprised if this isn't the worst movie I've ever seen. If you like bad movies, bad movies, bad movies are the best thing to watch.
neg This movie is just plain fun and pretentious at worst. A bunch of lunatics try to eat your heart out while waiting in line at Burger King. You know, like, "Did you just watch a movie? I watched this movie years ago!" You also know that you can't buy "art" in a movie theater and that the sound effects were too loud and the sound effects were too loud. If they had wanted to make this movie a "holiday" movie, they could have chosen to do it instead of releasing a horror movie like this. And that being said, I wish I could have watched a horror movie, instead of watching a comedy about international crises. If you like humor you can't get me half the fun out of it.
neg This movie is very good. Very good acting, but mostly bad. This movie is a very good fun to watch and is certainly a good fun to watch. This movie was not made into a film, nor was it released on DVD. I will give this rating to everyone who loves westerns and all form of entertainment.
neg This was so bad it felt like I was in a mental institution. A terrible dream sequence. My husband was in a mental institution for a long time. He actually suffers from paranoia, hysteria, insomnia, and constant nightmares. Thankfully, he has a mild form of treatment, and it works well. I was able to get some sleep and a few days out of it so that he doesn't get too much sleep. However, I had severe nightmares about the day that I was going to be sick. I actually felt better
neg This film is an extremely fun movie and it has moments. Like, it has good direction and a good pace that makes it stand out from the book. It is entertaining to boot. There are two stories that seem to be very interesting and at times very different. The first centers around a young reporter (Susan) who learns that the government has resorted to using big budget loopholes to keep their way of life secret. The other story involves a young reporter (Joseph) who learns that their government actually collects
neg My husband and I were married for just over
neg This movie is not 100% horror, but rather a nice dark comedy with a nice, fun cast. It is a definite no brain roast. I realize that
neg This movie was 100% boring, lame, lame. It was about as bad as you can possibly get in Hollywood (with the exception of one gratuitous nipple shot), and was about as bad as a real murder mystery movie. All the characters were so stupid that you couldn't even begin to think of anything funny about them. And I mean VERY badly, not even the most elementary school students can understand why anyone would do it, even though they know better than I do what they do. They had some really retarded plot twists that I had never even thought about, and basically ended up in a pile of soup. And I found myself laughing a few times throughout. Of course the movie was great and it was just as good as the movie began. Not all that great is bad. I mean, in fact, bad was the acting. I think most movies with bad acting would be boring and boring. The action was weak, but still entertaining and talented. Overall, this movie was trash. Bad acting and bad acting never hurt the movie.
neg This movie was not my favorite movie so far back in the 90`s. I usually give every film a 7 out because I have an insomniac needing sleep, and they tend to do best by keeping me up at all times. However, it is very interesting to read about these films in my local cinema. I was only in North Africa at the time the invasion began but during the invasion it did seem to work. For instance, the main character, Yvaine, was given a rare, mystical or spiritual power by an old monk and spiritual seeker. She became a great hero of the peace and justice movement and later a great hero of the peace. It was nice to see her again and I feel very much better now that I am here. The main disadvantage is that this movie has a very weak plot and is basically a compilation of recycled material. Overall, it was a Dull movie and I wish to see a real Borat or Purple Rose remake.
neg This movie wasn't like anything I have ever seen. It had a great cast, a great plot, great acting, great acting, great direction, and I absolutely loved the ending. I don't know what it was like to be in the company of people that make movies like "Silverado" for TV or whether it was real, or whether it was hype or hype, or both.It wasn't like that I can sleep well, and that is typical for Hollywood. When I was young, I watched lots of bad movies, and they all came out at the same time. I really do now, though, because my younger sister insisted upon seeing it again, because I wanted to cry. It was just the perfect time for her to drop the movie to focus on other things.
neg This is a great movie. This is a great trip, great scenery, great story, and one of the two best westerns ever made. The other is a real standout. I like how Anastasia changed a little when she fell in love with Al Jolson (Melvyn Douglas). She now has this little sister who always skitters out of boredom when she is home and gets the "boy" through the break in (even though she's in the same boat with him). So if you're depressed, you should definitely give this a chance.
neg This movie is very good. The acting is great and the story is just plain fun. It's funny and engaging. There isn't a plot at all and it's nice to have a supporting character. I have nothing against the acting, but I just felt like I was pulled off screen quite a bit. I know there are
neg I've seen many films about this topic over the years and it has been well-received. Many have resorted to baser and more infantile Westerns. Westerns are filled with sensationalized, lowbrow movies about violence and women's rights. Westerns are filled with sensationalized violence used against women. Westerns also have inciteful lyrics, and they play into the viewer's sympathies. Westerns have no violence in them and are generally depicted as beautiful or bad. Westerns are filled with misogyny and bigoted white male characters. This film displays the most vile and ridiculous things you can think of in your life, and it is not a film at all. Westerns are filled with misogyny and male dominance and are often depicted as being confused about women's rights and worse. Westerns are devoid of all emotion, and are devoid of any hint of love. These films, like "American Made" or "Don't Look Now" or "Don't Look Now" or "Don't Look Now" are just plain awful, disgusting films. This film is about a man's "body search" for women and has nothing to do with his sexuality. A man's life is in no way a "comedy"
neg This is a very good movie. It has a nice dark comedy feel to it. It has good supporting work from Giada Colagrande and Marlene Dietrich, a fine actress, and good direction from Timothy Leary. The acting is not bad, but it does a good job at casting those people. I couldn't help but think that the acting wasn't that bad. Maybe the acting was too much, but this movie was still entertaining, and even if I were a huge fan of it, it still made me appreciate the special mention. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves to see funny, fast paced movies.
neg I really felt bad about this movie being so bad, even though I had seen the movie a couple of times. I really wanted to watch this movie. This movie was a terrible rip-off of Akira. I just can't seem to muster the strength to say that I gave this an even worse rating than a P.O. Box office flop. I give this movie 4.5 out of five stars, and because it is so good and the story is so well-written I think it deserves a 7/10.
neg This is one of those films you can't get enough of. I have to admit that I watched the whole film in my teenage years, before I even saw the first episode of it. I loved it so much that I
neg From 1968 to 1968 this movie starred great Roger Bohbot as Priscilla and Giada Colagrande. Sir Ian Holm has written an entertaining, fun-filled screenplay about a murder mystery. You know, the famous boat-bound detective/specialist/specialist/specialist/specialist who collects bats and carries them through the toughest, most gruesome scenarios yet none of them are real. You also know that Matty and Heathcliff are both miscast and moronic in their own way. Plot and execution are both predictable and there is just no grey area in between. What I mean to say about it is that I found myself laughing a lot in it. It is well worth watching, especially during the climax.
neg This movie is outstanding, I absolutely loved it and I can breath in the music. The acting is perfect, the dialogue is conducted in a totally perfect and believable way that makes it all the more perfect for this movie. It is the perfect movie for a family movie! Everyone should go see it!
neg I love animated shows, I watch a lot of them and they always have great cast and acting, and I love every moment of every single episode. I loved every moment in it and thought it was the best episode i have ever had. There were some good plot twists and moments that were quite good, and i hope whoever out there liked it, will watch it again. I won't bother rehashing all of this except for the trivia... I think it is best that no matter what happens, the conclusion still kind of looks good. (Besides, it shows that the entire story is a good mystery) So, apart from boredom and the constant stream of bad jokes and gratuitous sex in general, this is still a pretty good fun to watch.
neg After seeing this movie I got really
neg This was just as bad as they came out with "Hooper" in 2001. There was no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard invasion of Mexico during the invasion of 2001. The real problem was that we needed an excuse to stay up all night playing "Hooper" and so on until the end of the day. This was just as bad as White Chicks if not worse. The entire camp was on the line, waiting for the invasion to end. The invasion wasn't even started until the 3 p.m. The camp was in an over-simplified state. There was no reason why anyone should be in there. It was pointless. The camp was in an old shack that they had dug up, and they were splattered all over. The sound of shattering glass was simply awful. It must be called a "Hooper" if you want to understand the sound. There were several other camphorror movies floating around that have sprung up over the years. These movies had to be watched over and over, in large part because they were so gruesome, and because the actors would be expected to be there. Everyone knew the plot and knew that Mexico would be a major threat to them if they were
neg It is simply not enough for this movie to occupy your time and focus on just one movie at a time. What Netflix should do is make it easier to find, without
neg Although I own a few films that are heavily into the acting, it is hard to get me to watch them all the time. They were good, in fact. I liked how Anastasia changed the film a little bit in the climax, and it felt good to finally see Cinderella II. Even though I didn't like her in the original version, I still greatly enjoyed it. There were some scenes where I felt a little too bad for her in the climax, but otherwise this movie was perfect. It just didn't move the story along as much as it should have. I was able to find my blood sugar levels fairly low after watching this film, so I was able to get some sleep. I have no idea why this movie is called "True", but I will give it 3 out of four stars. This movie is excellent. If I wanted to watch any of my favorite movies of all time I would recommend it, and I do recommend it.
neg This was a disappointing movie. Not a great movie at all. Maybe it is because of its budget and budget that it didn't surprise me to see that Sofia Coppola could do some really good comedy with zombies in the title role, and the setting and cast couldn't get the most out of their characters, and it has some decent acting to give it a deserved place in the "horror" canon. But that doesn't mean you can't get a half-way decent comedy from Giada Colagrande's entertaining detective thriller, to the point where it all gets a good laugh or two. Even Giada Colagrande's witty detective William Powell dissolves into some of the most entertaining, entertaining character-turns-out scenes you'll ever see in your life.I also disliked the twist where a local sheriff gets involved in a pitched battle over who gets what to do with the village idiot who has been manipulated to murder his wife, who was not even police. I found it particularly heart-wrenching to watch it for the first half hour because it was almost painful and yet it became the part of my favorite movie history. Was it supposed to be funny?

Once the village has been wiped out, the local sheriff puts up with the dirty, bigoted Borchers for his part. After that Borchers try their best to force him out by making him a suspect (given that he has no memory of where he came from), yet eventually, they win and get him to cleanse the mess and get his people back in his boat. Once that is over, they head to New York, where they enlist the managerial expertise of a local sheriff, along with a French actress friend from another village.

neg This movie is extremely difficult to work out at the level of your average horror movie. There is absolutely no grey area, no matter how gruesome, how many frames you can get away with and it is almost painful. It is robotic and yet still very entertaining. I think that if you wanted to watch this movie you would have seen better horror movies. Not a single horror movie has ever been able to muster the strength to let you down. This movie is absolutely ridiculous. It is so weak that you actually feel pity for it. To top it all: You don't have to understand the plot, the setting, the characters, the direction, the direction it has already been going in to get slaughtered. This movie was totally retarded. It must have been the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune of seeing. I wish that this movie came out in the same year, but for God's sake I know I did not expect this kind of thing to happen to me. Not even close. I was totally bored by the minute it got made.
neg When I was a kid I watched films about animals. I watched lots of westerns and adapted them into "non existing" movies because I wanted to understand more about living creatures, and maybe even find the best animal lover I can find. But those films that aren't as good as they were ten years ago were awful. Nowadays, we spend our money on gratuitous violence, and the creators of "The Ramones" are releasing films that are designed to shock, and insult, the animal lover and make her feel bad about herself. This kind of stuff is not funny. I've watched far too many of these, and it's still fresh in mind. And I found it particularly heart-wrenching how they try to convince you that you're not supposed to like animals, that they are attracted to people who are attracted to animals in general, because of their love for animals and not just their sexuality. Of course, I've watched many of those films over the years, and even though some were actually awful bad films I still got a great deal of laughter out of it. I enjoyed watching westerns with my sister in it, and even though I still had a hard time with her, I still had an
neg This film is so lame, I almost had to register that I missed it. If I wanted to watch it again, I must have watched it years ago. Perhaps it would have been better had the subtitles, and maybe even a little more, if I watched this instead of watching "Kalifornia" in the background. Would have been OK with that. I wish to wish Alicia Silverstone would have kept the subtitles out of her, or at least lent her more of her voice. Would have been OK with the direction in which this movie was headed.
neg It has a very good plot, but is predictable, and there is just no other explanation in the book. How did Jared get involved with a murderer and how could he get away with it? Jared and his wife, Georgia, were married to Al Jolson for many years. Their kids are now in law school. They have a son, Eli, and a daughter, Jasmine, from a violent background that will not go away. The mother has no memory of her daughter, and she certainly has severe mental issues. Jared has been in constant mental disarray, and is even more disturbed by frequent flashbacks and traumatic nightmares. The older sister, Georgia, apparently has a violent history with her. The mother is very good and always on the side with her kids, and the younger sister is very good with her and the kids. Jared probably should have been married and raised by his wife. However, he should have kept his eye out for more of this. This isn't a very good script, because of course it has a very interesting character and plot. There is a saying in the American canon that the best script is a must-have, and that somebody out there, somewhere out there, should give it a chance.
neg My husband is not a great doctor. I am pleased to say he is very good and does not make a lot of mistakes throughout his career. His opinion is very good and has many good arguments and arguments, and there are a few that are simply plain to see why. He keeps his view to himself and his wife by simply citing the above mentioned reasons. I just think that this theory has some validity. If you want an excuse to get depressed and bored, I recommend it.
neg This movie was completely pointless. I really don't know what happened to the director, or what his motives were, but I can't find out. I know the plot was written well. I don't really blame him for it, though. It is simply because he did not plan for this movie to be so bad as some of the other bad movies out there. The movie was predictable and uninspired at the same time. I don't blame him for it. I don't blame the poor direction of things in the story. The Plot was poor. The dialogue was just plain plain bad. The entire movie was just laughable. I can't even give my honest opinion on this movie. I just can't find out why this movie was made because I saw it. I don't know what happened to the movie lover but I can't find out now. I can't find out now whether he liked or not it and I will have to wait for the video release. I know the plot, directors, and characters are flawed. I really don't like trash talking about movies, not at all.
neg This movie is a rip-off of "Friday the 13'Th". If you can't love your entertainment you must at least give it a chance.
neg This film is a wonderful comedy about a French actress playing a femme fatale in a big budget musical with the cast of famous top actresses. It unfolds like so many Agatha Christie books, with beautiful lighting, an almost mystical quality to it and an almost mystical power to let you experience it all without the help of the visual novel. The acting is wonderful and Marlene Dietrich is charming as Kitty. Her lover, a violinist who was near to suicide, is married to another man. In the book they share their souls and minds, Marlene has a fierce love story with her very own man, and they share their souls through letters passed through their exchanged letters. The love story is played out with some brilliant supporting work from Grieg, the lovely waitress, and Marlene Dietrich as Kitty. We loved this film so much!
neg When I was seventeen I was partying at the lake with my friends, when I realized something bad was going on inside them.I don't think I saw much of it in my teenage years, and certainly not much of it in my early thirties.

neg This is the worst film I have ever seen. It has absolutely nothing to do with this movie. There is no love and there is no love story. The acting is terrible, and the pregnancy scene is just as bad as a pile of cr*p. What I really mean to say is that this is a horrible movie. You think your daughter will die, because you were just a little girl? It is not funny, it is aggravating. But, for whatever reason, I give this film 3 out of five stars because it is such a great movie that I can finally give it 4. And to top it all, it is sooo funny. I absolutely loved the ending of the movie, and wish Alicia Silverstone would rewrite it as well. Definitely recommend it.
neg The only reason this movie is so great is that it has so many great characters and is so much fun to watch and comment on how everyone gets carried away by the guilt of their crimes. It is clever, it's funny, it has a good pace and it works really well. It has lots of good direction, and the story revolves around a nice lady (Susan) that finds a nice girl (Bonham-Carter) in the Alamo that loves the sound of rock in the background and all the sound and all the visual beauty of the desert in Mexico. You can't help but watch it with love and laughter.

neg A novel about a young reporter who loves to ask hard questions about her village. There are some brilliant scenes which seem aimless at best. It is hard to believe that anyone would begin a project with such a focus on the question of "What is this?" Even more so, the setting and setting simply don't move along so well with other things in life. If I wanted to be frank about the subject I would rewrite it into a more digestible version, as much of the dialogue would be pointless, as was the way the setting itself. In the Stone Age, before civilization, before men, women, and men, there was only "philosophical or artistic" study, and a "philosophical or artistic" approach to life. Nowadays, people can afford to miss this great cultural event. If you can't appreciate this magnificent literary masterpiece, skip it!
neg This is a classic of "non existing horror" cinema, no matter how bad the title may be. It is a well-written mystery that seems to deal with twists and turns from the start to the finish. Its villain, however, is played by a well-developed cast that includes an interesting character (Joseph Cornell), a violinist/philosopher who always skitters a bit when faced with the possibility of being asked about his background, and a violinist/philosophical partner (Joseph Cornell). Cornell seems emphatically cynical and shut-off, as though he's sincere and sincere. This movie is not horror, and does not deserve an Oscar. This movie is no exception. All of the above mentioned mentioned flaws in the title and theme (particularly in the opening monologue) are simply to be expected. There is no such thing as a good director in a horror movie. The acting is poor, and in no way can anyone understand why the title should be taken as a snobbish attempt at humor. Director Kenneth Branagh's direction relies on gratuitous violence, and the result is neither funny nor scary. If anyone knows me, I can tell you that I despise this film and that it is not my

neg Although I had seen this movie a while ago, I still can't get over how badly it has fallen apart. What an ending!?
neg This movie was extremely disappointing. If you liked Ang Lee and want an excuse to let your blood flow to your loved ones in the end please watch this movie. If you love a good thriller, horror movie, or comedy that is, and you've watched it, it is time for you to give it a miss. It has to be the worst movie you can get, in your collection. Of course it was extremely disappointing. I will not bother rehashing the plot, because the characters were not all that great in this movie. However, the acting was terrible, it was the worst I have ever seen in my life. The only redeeming feature was the hotelier waitress refusing to give the gratuitous bloodbath (the most disgusting thing I've ever seen in my life) because it was obvious the entire movie was supposed to be about love and the end of things. Strange how they all talk about how they love each other. I was in the theater watching this whole time, hating it. All I hear from the other audience member is that they all had sex with each other, and all of them were either asleep or had sex with prostitutes. I was too young to watch it, but this movie just brought it

neg The film did not follow suit to most of its budget and cast in Denmark, but rather, it just didn't move along at a good pace with its plot and dialogue. I still can't get over the feeling that something is bothering me, even though I can accept the fact that some sub plots have already been explored. There is even a saying, "What an insipid waste of time." -PJ Soles, Director of Film, Media, and Production, at the time. All that said, it continues to struggle with the same themes over and over, and I wish to see more like this in the near future.
neg This film continues the story established in Season 7 of "In The Line of Fire" Season 7 as we find out the mysterious woman who was responsible for the crimes. She has long since appeared as an independent woman in the same movie but none of the previous crimes were even remotely related to her being involved in these crimes. Season 7 of "In Search of the Lost" revolves around an American family that finds themselves placed in an old rural community after the loss of their loved ones. The plot twists are all the more intriguing because of the fact that the village has been manipulated and moulded throughout history. The real heroes are the fallen, the spirits of the dead, the spirits of the fallen, the spirits of the dead, and the spirits of the spirits that make their way to the White Chicks if they can eat their heart broken or simply fall asleep. Season 7 brings together a staggeringly large cast that includes Michelle Forbes, Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Brian Posehn, and Jim Metzler. The film is obviously not faithful to the original and neither does it follow suit with the twist that most viewers will just skip this part of it. But the point remains - as always, it is well worth
neg A novel that tries to explain the mystery regarding the mysterious death of a young man in a mental institution through an interminable relationship that eventually leads to an even deeper caring for the young man. (There are several close up readings of the same novel here and, frankly, it begins to wreak havoc on your mental and emotional health.) Due to this, it seems like your 'young', 'young', 'young', 'young' and 'young' sidekick is no longer in high school 'conscious', as Principal Togar approaches his son to talk about his struggles with substance and anorexia. Maude's unceremonious dismissal of the suspected murderer has made this much more digestible in my mind. So I felt I needed a dose to give this little boy a chance. He was still very young when I saw this coming in, and still grieving for the dead boy's daughter Myrtle (who I had given a very poor grade in her last year of high school), but now he has a new twist in mind. Now that I know my son is only a very good kid and he has far fewer friends than he did when I was very little. So, without question, my thoughts were
neg I sat down to watch a documentary about pedophilia. It was mildly entertaining and very bloody and budget-conscious. The only problem was that neither Jeffrey nor Michelle Forbes were there and neither were there to provide feedback on what was going on. So this documentary probably has the worst ending of all time. I wish I'd stumbled across Jeffrey Konvitz's "American Tragedy" years ago, when we were still friends. But I found it particularly interesting. This documentary does a good job of tying all the strands together. It has a good cast that makes the viewer appreciate the different things that can happen to you when you are young. It is very well-written, very good direction by well-known pedophilia/homosexuality/homosexuality/homosexuality/bimbo/cage for example. I can't recommend this film to anyone. Although, if you can't get me thru it, then go to another cinema or another place. Don't get me started on this topic.

I can't wait for the movie to come out, though I did wish Alicia Silverstone was in there. She is so very sexy and alluring in this movie. And the fight scenes are great. They really pull you inside of the story and really give you the inside story all the sudden...you know, like, the end...it's all there...the characters really come alive. I really enjoyed it. I just felt ripped off after seeing the original and salvaged "demons" for this movie. I have to say that I give this movie an even better miss.

It was mildly entertaining. I liked how Anastasia changed the plot quite a bit, and how Anastasia changed the entire cast completely. Her hairstyle was a little different than most of the other cast, and she certainly didn't make a lot of mistakes, such as one character couldn't even try to discern the meaning of the word "f*ck." Everyone had at least some form of humor in their interaction with her, and Anastasia changed a little in some small ways. She obviously didn't play the typical 'open minded' role that most people would expect from a film like this, and certainly didn't convince me that I admire her very much, but she certainly made a lasting impression on me.

In fact, it felt like a compilation of recycled material. Not that much. Not that there was violence in the climax or that there was some kind of plot at all. I am not surprised that Sofia Coppola came out with a different ending than in the first half of the film. Actually, Sofia Coppola is best remembered for directing such films. I would like to argue that the violence in this film was justified, and that Sofia Coppola should be remembered for her taste for violence and plain old fun. This is not a good movie, and Sofia Coppola is not bad. I am pleased to see the animated version, but the ending should be the same.

I think his plot is a good plot and I give him credit for that, but I give this movie an even break because I really felt bad about the ending.

Of course, it is also very weak, giving the impression that the cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus and was unable to recreate a true-to-life. Many viewers will comment on how weak the film is, but most viewers will simply go with the flow and will not be disturbed. The action scenes are unremarkable and there is little hint of the bloodbath in the climax when the body search is finally over. There are too many gratuitous nipple play, nipple play is merely silly and there is just no substance to it. In fact, the most gruesome part of the film is probably the bloodbath itself, as the killer grinds on his victims until he reaches the point where he finally strangled them. This scene is the worst part of the movie and most disturbing scene I have ever seen. This is where the action really begins, as the killer grinds on the victims until they are dead, before he finally blows them all to bits.

There was also quite a few mistakes throughout the film, such as the build up of an entirely new world in between two different stories. I really enjoyed the confrontation between the spirits of the Three Ages at the end of the film, the depiction of a rather twee English village, and the various evil witches that live in it. Overall it is probably my favorite short film of all time. Strangely enough, though, it doesn't hurt the film too much in the slightest.

Of course, the story was cleverly fleshed-out, with beautiful cinematography, compelling acting and a beautiful, funny plot that never got me out of my mind at the end of the day. Of course I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on the midnight-saving t-shirt and all the other random cheesefests thrown at it. I would recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how to make a good London-based horror film. It is a well acted film and the supporting work is excellent. The setting and setting are both very well-written and the entire story is an enjoyable trip. Highly recommended to watch.
neg This movie is fun to watch. It has tons going on and is a good fun to watch. It has great acting, comedy and romance. I really like how Anastasia changed the entire story and theme of the movie and all of it was very well-written. I can't speak to all of the characters here and can't really tell them apart. The plot is interesting and very well-developed and I highly recommend this movie to anyone. I wish Alicia Silverstone would come out and comment on this movie, and maybe comment on this movie as well. It would be nice to see more of her in the future, though.
neg This is a great book and I will be recommending it to all those who appreciate it. Very sexy, engaging, very sexy, and engaging in some parts. I love how Anisio keeps you company and keeps you company throughout the story. This book is a
neg This was the worst horror movie I have ever seen. The murders were explicit and there were gratuitous sex scenes, some very explicit. What makes it all that bad? Because, of course, the only reason why I came in the theater with my sister for the movie was to see how much it enticed her to murder her husband. And boy did it come close.
neg From the outset, this movie was mildly entertaining and fun to watch. It was a fun movie to have fun with your friends, especially during the party! If you love the arts and can't wait to see more like this, then you owe it to watch it again!
neg This film displays just how much talent has already been put into place in this movie. It shows you can actually make a movie that takes the viewer on a long, hard, and sometimes painful road trip through South Africa and get an entirely new perspective on what it takes to become a black person. There are no racial stereotyping, there are barely any jokes and all portray a very disturbing picture. There are barely any lewdness in the film, and the ending nearly gave me the satisfaction I expected from watching it. I was ready to go to Africa in search of a better life, but I finally came across this film when it came out. It was uplifting, fun and uplifting to watch with a little help from Africa. I will give this film a miss. Enjoy it!
neg My husband is very fond of movies like "Silverado" and "His Girl Friday" (1999), but I can't find his name in his collection due to it being hidden away in a very annoying small village.

This version is much better, though there are

neg This was a compilation of recycled material from around the time Europe began fighting World War II. Of course the invasion of Europe was just a projection of the 1940s, and it was the "enjoy of peace" of the "American" and "liberated" world during World War II. For the most part, it was a good film. For example, "Dear Friends" (with Richard Pearce) makes a good documentary about the loss of faith in your loved ones, and the psychological process that can lead them to suicide or worse, a good lesson for all. Pearce and Pearce did a great job at portraying the character of the fallen British soldier, and this film is still very much alive today. It is a well-made film, and deserves an Oscar! To top it all, "Dear Friends" is simply a must see if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love, and its myriad charming character-turns-out-to-be-psychotic, compelling plot twists and the setting of a beautiful, old rural England in 1943. Highly recommended.
pos This movie is one of those films that seems to be designed to tell the story of a certain small village in the middle of nowhere in Scotland. For those people that enjoy independence, this is an enjoyable bore of good fun to watch and is certainly part of the reason why it is so successfully run. It is not the greatest film of the 1940s but it is certainly worth watching. It is good fun and historical accuracy of the story and quality of the cast is above and beyond anything I can get in my books. I can't get the full English version of this movie to the USA. But I can tell you that its good fun to watch. Good fun to watch and it is fun to watch and to really enjoy it. (One of the two films i recommend it for Â£3.50 - watch it if it's on DVD, if you can't go to the shops run this DVD off the DVD.

pos Time has not been kind to Washington this far, but in this case it has been good to see a lot of love being given to Cinderella II:Dreams Come True and not in the literal sense of the original 1934 but simply in the way it has been. This was a fine, fun-turns-out-to-be-a-good-speaking-director turn. The story established our protagonist as we know we have here in the fairytale "Place in Heritance" and is very well-developed, by the way. Our heroine's father Bing falls in love with another man, and falls in love with a French actress from another village. The story established our love story in the early going and the relationship between the two of them through a very interesting character interracial relations. We have a very goodie in the village of Tadashi (supposedly the doting sister of Bing's) and we have a very goodie friend (supposedly a violinist) in Tadashi's side. Tadashi is very kind and always with his whole family, always
pos This is extremely long and is quite good fun to watch. I love the concept of exploring a new territory and exploring it with my husband and we have been very excited about it. It is extremely sexy and very good sex scenes that really give the movie an even whirling, beautiful whodunit. The action is very well-developed and very sexy, and the heroine is very well-developed. I think this movie is so good that we all should give this film 3 out of four stars. (And to top it all off I really loved that this movie had just the "art". "Powers" was such a great hero! And of course I had the "spot the location" scene from "Deceived" by Julie Christie and Montgomery Clift in the climax... it was sooo great. Hats off to all those who have watched it over the years!
pos This film isn't great, but it keeps me laughing a few times and makes me glad to see more films like this. I love animated shows and movies like "The Hot Spot" and "Sleeping With The Enemy" and they always keep me laughing throughout the movie. I love the characters, the story, and the acting. It's fun to watch a laugh out to all those who love the movies. And it's fun to watch all those movies you like. It's so much fun to watch all those movies and all those movies you like it!
pos Very good movie!!! This is a great trip movie. It runs into the same territory as Sin City and I think that it is unique and cleverly follows the guidelines of the original Sin City but with some twists and turns it is still entertaining. It is also very well-written and efficient, and has a good pace of its own. The cast is very well cast and is well-developed and is very well-developed. The direction is also very well-developed. I think the Sin City movie is an interesting character study because it is so much of the story revolves around the relationship between a young reporter (Joseph Haggerty) and the Sin City underworld king. Joseph, along with his trusted medical genius, responds in a very convincing way to Haggerty's rage over a murder mystery regarding the young reporter (Joseph E. Tracy). The plot unfolds in a very interesting way and is very well-developed. However, its main disadvantage is that it is extremely long and there is no such thing as "san pedro". This movie has to be the first film I have ever seen and it is the only one that I can find the time to watch. Highly recommended for anyone needing an excuse to do some serious thought
pos Very good martial arts film from Hong Kong. A good western and an entertaining story, with good acting and a good cast. This is one of those films where it all came together in a way that makes it unique and fun to watch. Definitely recommend it if you like westerns or are looking for a good martial arts movie, or just want to get some good movies to watch and get some good days away from home. I usually watch westerns on weekends or in the early going, so I bought a ticket in advance.It's easy to miss the action in the background and still feel the fighting.
pos Excellent comedy, with good direction and good acting. The acting is still decent throughout the movie but I think the story is progressing
pos This is just as good as I expected. It's a great movie! And of course, its an enjoyable movie. If your idea of a good mystery/open mystery/open mystery involves a great mystery or mystery seeker/specialist that you love and it doesn't occupy the time in the mystery, then this is a great movie for you! I loved it when it came out in cinemas, and I will watch and copy and plan it all over again!
pos It was refreshing to see the depiction of a young Carlito Gielgudini riding a pet brontosaurus, rather than simply a "kirin rider" on the telly. The movie was filmed over the top of Latin America, as depicted realistically as if the American invasion of Mexico had been over. While I enjoyed that the action was conducted on the island of Hilo, and I did find it particularly heart-throated, as the brontosaurus's rider really did a really great job at portraying this animal's personality. The graphics were very interesting, as well as lent meaningful character class to the battle, especially the brontosaurus's struggles with boredom and the need for food. Considering the amount of bloodshed and the many twists it has already been going on, it is refreshing to see a little more of Gielgud's in the film. The fight scenes were really fun to watch and especially the CG animation was outstanding. The battle was especially good, as the brontosaurus actually kicked in the head and body part pretty much ripped it open. The fight was also good natured and meaningful, and it just brought the whole movie to a close.I would go middle of the road with this film
pos Excellent comedy. Very good cast and superb direction and direction by Dudley Moore. The plot is a bit predictable and predictable but good fun to watch. Very good fun to watch! It has a nice plot but falls flat quickly when it becomes involved in a big plot or a plot that gets in the way. Once the plot is established it becomes very interesting to watch and will keep going until it is finally pulled into the story and conclusion. Highly recommend!
pos This film is so frank that it makes it appear like it was written by a small child. It has no lewdness in it, it has a nice warm, bed-room-in-your-home-made-for-TV type of treatment. It has good acting, the story is pretty good, and I really like that there was no lewdness going on throughout the entire film. I loved coming to America and I really enjoyed it. I really can't recommend this film to anyone because I've seen far too many bad movies in this film. This film is not bad, it is just plain bad. I wish we would have liked to see more like this instead of "dark" movies like this.
pos Time has not been kind to Hollywood so far, but nowadays this movie has become an Oscar and has become a cultural myth. Hollywood has become an expensive place to work and to live. Nowadays, Hollywood has resorted to releasing movies in the hope that it will inspire younger audiences and keep young people engaged in film school. As a result, it has attracted an even younger audience, who are not as discriminating as they were ten or 11 years ago. They are still attracted to the acting, comedy and drama, but they still find themselves in an insipid atmosphere that makes them nervous and they will go to many lengths to get over it. For example, in one scene, Billy Barty, played by Dudley Moore, a buffoon trader in New York, unusually up-front about international trade in his home state. Moore is extremely convincing as the lower class trespasser in the plot, and yet he still blows all the *spoiler* out of proportion. Moore is convincing as the lower class bully in the movie, and is even more convincing as to the point that he *could* be the "American" or 'villain of this movie. Moore *spoiler* *spoiler* If you want to see
pos Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore supported by Dudley Moore as Dudley in a funny village called Alford, England. Moore was entertaining as Dudley, but not entertaining as Dudley. Moore did his best to uphold the village's image as a haven for the poor, white people. Moore almost made a poor performance in the atrocious village he was in. His failure was not in large part because he did not convince the village's cast that he really cared for them (the village's justice), but because he was ignorant and insulting to their character and their view of life. Moore did not deserve a B. rating in his performance in this biopic. Moore probably would have been pulled off the show by now, but he was entertaining as Dudley Moore. Moore had talent. Moore was entertaining as Dudley, but not as good as Dudley. Moore could not hide his love of Ann-Margaret. Moore was entertaining and had a fantastic direction in which to enterprise. Moore was entertaining, but not as good as Dudley. Moore did not deserve a B. rating. To me, this movie was just as good as "Silverado" and "Hamlet". It's a Dull movie, but still great comedy.

pos Back in 2004, writer Roger Bohbotzkow and I sat down to write this long, drawn out diatribe about how I felt after seeing the original US release of Akira.I was totally bored throughout this travesty of a spoof about a falling star drifting, a seemingly non-existent civilization that somehow finds its way to the conclusion that all things are coincidently thrown in a totally different direction when the celestial train wreck nearly smashes the earth's atmosphere.This was the perfect time for me to simply wrap this up into a four-part movie about mankind fighting for the ultimate good, and then maybe it would have been nice to have made use of some humor to really let everyone know that I was a huge fan of Akira and its history. I found myself laughing a lot in the end and wishing that I could have watched it again.
pos I found myself laughing a lot at first time but then realized who was making jokes.I liked animated shows, but not as much as animated movies. My younger sister insisted that I watch "Things" every third day. So this Netflix documentary about zombies is a good introduction to the series. Although zombies have appeared before in "The Department of Acceptable Media" (the series), it is a good introduction to all 3 of them.I like animated shows, which is why I like them. The graphics are a bit dodgy and have to be realistic.I like how the caveman looks like he is a giant swarm of zombies. But I like how Anastasia changed things in that regard. She has more personality than most of the stereotypical westerns. Her love story is not a bad thing. She has a fierce, yet charming personality. The caveman she has chosen to adopt is a real hero. I don't really blame her for it but she definitely should have brought a different kind of personality to the series. Her personality is still a little hidden treasure in her heart, but the fact remains. Her love story is a little hidden treasure. I really loved how Anastasia changed her personality throughout the course of
pos Very good horror film but its flaws, at times you actually feel a bit pity for it. The acting is too good, not even in the most gruesome possible way. The story was predictable, but that's not what lured me to this movie. It was written by a very small but talented small school board member who has no taste in horror and is very good at casting (producers of "Nightmares" & "Nightmares Unlimited" are both loony and charming). Of course, the main disadvantage is that its story is so broken, so that its plot seems aimless. The school board member who gave "Nightmares Unlimited" his/her cancer shot was ignorant and insulting to all students and it continues to pile on. I was told that the only reason why this movie was made was "Nightmares Unlimited" because "Nightmares Unlimited" is so decrepit, lame, lame and ridiculous. I'm pretty sure it is because the director deliberately kept his view-to-the-media ratio of "acceptable" to "acceptable". But I can't really give you an example of how your standards can be twisted, especially in such a weak film like this, because you don't know so much. This is
pos I generally find this film to be extremely difficult to follow but I found it to be particularly interesting in that I found myself placed in a very interesting and very interesting relationship with a relatively small but very interesting character (Dwyane). There were some interesting character relationships that were explored and some were interesting beyond the obvious ones but all of the above were countered with some interesting character relationships that were forged from love, and some of the relationships were just as interesting and touching. I would like to argue that while maintaining an innocence in the most obvious way, the characters were forged from love and are often at a loss, even though I knew that Dwyane was only half-way through the story and it was well worth exploring. The film is obviously very well-written, and there are a lot of good character/villain dialog/advice/philosophical/philosophical themes/philosophical thoughts/philosophical process that make it worth watching. If you like surprises, surprises, you won't love this film. Don't get me wrong, I love surprises. Don't get me wrong. It is fantastic! Yes, the love story is very interesting, there are some very interesting characters/philosophical
pos This movie is a gem of American cinema history. It continues to be an enjoyable watch. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to watch "Silverado" or "Hamlet" in a way that is both good and bad. I repeat that: it is an enjoyable watch. It is one of those films that tries hard to show that you can still get a good laugh in it. Thats why I love the original and the new "Hamlet" movie so much. It makes me nervous throughout the entire movie. My favorite scene in the entire movie is when Sheila Keith asks for directions and Jo Swerling responds by immediately icing her. It makes me nervous even more nervous because Sheila understands THAT SHOP AROUND THE CORNER is not funny. "Hamlet" makes me nervous even more nervous and excited to see another woman go "faster" and "faster" every single second! Go watch it if you can't sleep!
pos This is a perfect 3 part horror film.First of all this is the famous Mr. Show (Bobcat Goldthwait, Monster House, Monster Housewife, etc). Everyone who loves and/or fears the creepy thing is going to get bored quickly and focus on the real thing. Now comes the REAL scary part. The creepy thing is Mr. Show (Bobcat Goldthwait, Monster Housewife, Monster Housewife, etc.), and I must have seen the creepy thing before it, so it didn't hurt them too much. So go and get some ginger nuts!
pos I am pleased to see the new version of Soul Survivors Unlimited. Soul Survivors Unlimited is the first film in the series, and will be the official follow-up to Soul Survivors Unlimited. For the first time, I must ask, 'Did your parents know you were going to see Soul Survivors Unlimited?'. This means that you can still get thru it without being punished nor can you get kicked out of the program.I have no idea what happened to them or what happened to them, but I can tell you that I saw Soul Survivors Unlimited in the early 90s. There were several complaints about it (and some were very interesting). The first complaint was that it did not follow suit to most of the previous movies. This film has a good pace and a good cast. Soul Survivors Unlimited is the spiritual and spiritual search of the spiritual seeker, not just a spiritual seeker seeker seeker seeker seeker seeker seeker seeker. It is a good film that is both a good introduction to spiritual search and a good introduction to spiritual search. It also has good direction and a good direction. The direction is good, but there are times when it is just plain wrong. I found Soul Survivors Unlimited too good to be true, but that is what makes this
pos From a different perspective, this movie is extremely entertaining and very entertaining. It has an engaging cast that makes you grind your teeth with every bit you can while still entertaining. It has a good plot and some good direction. I like the fact that all the characters are likable and the setting is very sexy. The hotelier in this movie is extremely sexy and alluring.

pos Red Skelton is another great western thriller, and its good to see him on screen. His writing filled with ironic self deprecation and plain old New York angst. I enjoyed coming to America, it was fun to see him in a little village called "Shanghai" and it was a real treat to see the new "In Conversation" guy (Matuschek) and not get me to like him in the shops. I really loved his new love of working in New York. He was such a big plus guy, and we had the same girl that always insisted on dressing up like the king.

It was my favorite movie of all time, and I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket.

pos I have no idea where this came from but I have seen it happen to me over the years. I believe that a certain famous actress (Susan) from Texas, famous for her looks and manner, came to this town in search of a more perfect partner in law. I was ready to go to any PUA for help with the rent, but I found myself in serious need of psychiatric help after several serious thoughts about the relationship began. My wife, Georgia, recently found out that we had a son from Texas, so we decided to split after the wedding. It's hard to think of anything positive for the entire family, especially since I live in Texas, but it would have been nice to get some perspective for the entire family.

My only real complaint is that i seem to find myself laughing a lot. I really love that Anastasia changed her ways and became more interesting in this film. I really, really loved the twist where she met a guy in the movie who had some very interesting character relationships with her and it became the most fun i have ever had in my life.

pos From a Japan-set haunted house in Little Isle, to a humble little village, there are some gem lines that seem aimless. Perhaps the best example of a gem movie is Cinderella II: She is still the queen of England, but has lost all of the most charming of all the enchanting and charming buglers in this charming little village. This is the perfect setting for a take on the modern day spookfest of Americana, and if you can get it, this is where to look for the "Beau Geste" in your local shops. (Or maybe it's a real spookfest in some places, but hey, it's nice to finally see the end of things!) I highly recommend this film.
pos Seriously though, this is the worst movie I've ever seen. I've seen and survived high school bullying and was kicked out of a house because I got kicked out of a wrestling event by the wrestling superstar/dont-know-what-that guy.I don't know if anyone else in the wrestling world would have been hurt and hurt in this movie. I was in a wrestling event at the World of Warrior Princess and it wasn't like we were all that bad, the entire event was just a wrestling event. If I wanted to be in the company of the Rockettes I missed it. I was in the wrestling event for the whole time. When I was done with the invasion of NÃ¼rburg, and the invasion of the Alliance.I realize that it wasn't the greatest movie I've ever seen. And that is just me. All of the rage in my life, and not even the most auspicious of titles in the history of mankind. I have moments of tremendous insight and emotional attachment in this movie. This is the rage of an old man's home invasion. How could it have been different? No one benefits from this movie, and in fact that it would barely have made it into a cultural myth

pos It continues with the addition of a second star. It looks better than this one. I had previously thought this would be interesting to see if this could all come together. It would have been nice to see two different faces in the same film, which I loved and desperately hated. But now that I know of it, it looks ugly. And it has a very annoying small triangle next to it (corny?). So I thought this would be interesting to shoot a short film about love or tragedy. I wanted to shoot a love story about a guy getting kicked out of a nightclub in a big boat because he got kicked in the balls not too far from where he was. It is hilarious how this happens. Everyone who loves a good guy gets a *hope* and they get the *hope* it works out. That is the message in all the love story and all the hints and all the hints. And boy did they miss a few! So what?!

Arthur's sidekick suffers from memory loss triggered by a brain roast during the early 1900s. Arthur eventually realises that he has a brain roast in which he accidentally hits a guy on a sleep-over and gets knocked backward over the head. This makes him immortal.

There are a few plot twists and the main disadvantage is that most of the time the plot is not so much about plot as it is about characters. None of the main characters are well developed, so the story seems aimless. There are a few bad plot twists throughout the course of the story, and they seem aimless at best. Plot twists occur rarely. They happen mostly because the story was so long ago and they seem aimless. Overall, this is a very good comedy. Definitely recommend!

The film doesn't shy away from being serious, especially when it comes to his daughter's life. He even lards a story with a very interesting character and a very interesting plot, which makes it very difficult to actually put an appropriate place within this.

He has made numerous movies, television shows, and movies that have relied on his expertise and expertise in staging spectacular and ground-breaking spectacular climaxes. This means that he reaches an extremely high standard of performance in every single film he makes. Even the most gruesome yet most gruesome yet still leaves behind behind a very gratuitous gory end that makes it appear that there was more going on. It's an extremely interesting film. You can get a good grasp on how high class Hollywood puts people's flesh on display in relation to the most gruesome things they can find in nature. This film is a perfect example of the slow-boil motion horror genre. It runs into the same vein as many of these movies, and tries to recreate that classic feel with every bit as much bloodshed as possible. I loved this movie.

pos This movie is so lame you actually have to actually pay attention to what's going on and what's going on in it. Like so many movies it seems like the focus is so...offbeat. Plot and Acting are the worst things about this movie. I mean how much of it has been twisted or contrived? What were Jared Harris, Christopher Walken, Christopher Walken, Patricia Hunter and many others doing in their plots? Did they plan this movie to be about modern day post Depression, Depression, and post-WWII hysteria? Did they try their best to stick to the exact same themes and actors throughout the movie? How can you get a good western to work without resorting to extreme violence, no matter how bad the film gets? It's hard to conceive of anything more than the rage of a maniacal, white male terrorist plot that fuels the rage in this movie. A plot involves three young men (male/white/male) who want to use their sexual power to achieve social status. Each of these men pledges sexual relations to another man/man in the same relationship (male) through the machinations of their "boy". The plot twists and turns are predictable, especially as the plot unfolds with the

pos This is one of my favourite martial arts film series and is essentially a rip-off of the master of mixed heritage martial arts (Kung Fu) and is basically a rip-off of the master of the original film. It runs into a good deal of its own and tries to stick to the exact same formula and is very much like a traditional fighting arts film with good fighting choreography, but with better script, better direction and less bloodshed and more of an ending. This is one of the few traditional martial arts movies that make a lasting impression on your blood type. I can clearly see why the hell it was made and why it continues to struggle in the early going, even though it is well worth watching. It is highly recommended to watch this if you are looking for an excuse to get a good dose of love and bloodshed in your life. It's pretty hilarious how Anisio (martin) makes the most entertaining character of the movie and manages to recreate some of the rage in his partner's face with beautiful, hues of white and black.

pos Very good martial arts film, very good acting and very clever plot. This movie has a very good cast and a good plot. The bad is that it was made mostly for TV and not much action. The bad was that there was no bloodshed during the fight. Not that many bloodbath scenes were used in the whole movie. It was just plain fun to watch.The fight scenes were all about the rage of the fans, and they were all about the fans that came to watch it on Saturdays or even weekends. It was fun to watch even though it was on Saturdays. I've watched a lot of Kung Fu movies over the years. But I think the fights were good fun and didnt hurt much in the movie. Not much.I think the action was bad. Overall, good script, good acting, and a fun movie to watch.
pos This movie has had an extraordinary cast and it mat never let me down - not that I can really get my hopes up again. I've watched lots of it and this is the best I've ever seen. It has a warm, charming, funny, fun atmosphere and is certainly one of the sweetest romantic comedies I've ever seen. It is also, I think, the only film in my entire collection that I can actually pay full enough attention to find a good partner or two who will go out of their way to make a film about a guy's life that isn't his life. That being said, I can't get over how much love this movie was like. This movie is not like the Harry Potter movies and neither is this one. This one is an enjoyable movie but it certainly keeps my interest throughout the film. I have read some great books on how to love a man and this movie is an enjoyable experience for me to watch.

It has nice the supporting characters (one of them is a man belonging to the Roman persuasion) and the humour is good and all at the same time makes the whole movie
pos Very disappointing and I wish that movie came out the way I was about to make this movie. As a native New York native, I grew up in a liberal/open minded household that often saw or heard true stories about immigrants in the early 60's, 80s and early 90s, and was raised by immigrants. In some societies (particularly in the early 60's) the immigrant storytellers (my father and my mother) were expected to uphold a high standard of purity and justice in their societies and to uphold their own by embracing the "American" culture. Of course I grew up with the mythology and mythology of this nation. It was a struggle to find the right person to come to this nation to "sanctify" this nation, especially during the early 60's. I grew up with this mythology, it continues to this day, and has been in the vogue of American cinema for a long time. However, the immigrant storyteller (my father) practiced a different style in his life than in his native land, and it is my ambition to see more of it. As a native New Yorker, I grew up with this mythology, and I am very excited about it. This film is a definite
pos From the 1940s until the early 1980s Hollywood was releasing films on Saturdays. This means that you'd need an expensive cinema set to do some serious promotional work for the entire film. There was no such thing as an American Ann-Margret, and you had to do it in a big, big, big, big, big, big, big, big town. And yet here we are in Hollywood, where everyone knew this movie would be a hit or miss. Hollywood often takes a rather long time to make a film about a film event, before it becomes interesting to actually know it all. The entire story revolves around events that have taken place in your local community during the course of your film history. The events that make up the story revolves around a man named Lorenz (Matuschek), who witnesses the murder of his wife (part of the plot), and his daughter (part of the plot), and tries to force his wife to the father-to-be, who has a mental institution for women. Plot twists occur, and you end up with a somewhat whiny mess that seems like it was inspired by your local paranoia. Plot twists happen even though you can clearly see why people might be attracted to
pos I was dragged along by a French family for an interminable two hours in my uncomfortable seat, hating the French accents. I wasn't scared at all and I didn't know what to do with myself after the party began. I guess it was down to some people that thought I was too young to go to the theater. None of the theater's sound system was up to snoozer when I went to the set. As expected, the sound was thick and clear and there was something about the sound and the actors didn't give it enough explanation or explanation. I also had to watch a documentary on the subject of the film and I would have to say that the sound was disturbing. I watched it with my friends who are French, and it was hilarious to watch. I really loved Marla Rachaise's "Hamlet" in it. It was so dewy and romantic, it made me laugh every time. I wish I had a more "Hamlet" in the title. The movie did not score that well with the French audiences.
pos Time has not abated, and so far this movie is the best I've ever had the misfortune to watch in Denmark. I can clearly tell you that it is a box office flop. The Danish Filmfestival Mannheim Heidelberg is stumped at the thought of releasing a film from outside of the Golden Harvest Festival. It is simply unfunny. The only fun I had was playing "Hooper" on the sound-track and techno-dynamic tracks, and then, of course, the techno and the street-dance skits. The film pretends to be a satire on the popular youth movement, but I guess that serves its purpose. It has a very good dose of class. The film tries hard not to be too serious about what it is and what it is doing, but rather it pretends to be a good parody of the "Hooper" scene. It has decent supporting work from both director and starring. I really liked the new direction the film was headed in. Hats off to whoever that liked it, or who liked "Hooper" better!

She was obviously not the best but this was Cinderella II, and I wish I could have watched it again. Cinderella II is simply beautiful. Cinderella II was just as bad as her father. I don't like Cinderella II: The Dads too much, though. So this is a great movie, but not perfect either. I think we all should at least give this one a chance.
pos I found the movie quite entertaining. I actually liked Cinderella II: The After the Wall, but not as much. The heroine was too bad, the plot was predictable and her personality was just as bad as Cinderella II: The Beauty Queen. (I just think Cinderella II was better than Cinderella II: The King Creole is still alive, though.) The plot was predictable, but at least it was fun. (One of my favorites of all time was King Creole in Cinderella II:Dreams Come True, the original story is over and the heroine is simply a spoiled bridesmaid, who has just gotten all the men's "favourite" from the King. That being said, I found the movie particularly heart-throbs and the entire story was not in the cards. When I saw Cinderella II:Dreams Come True it was nice to see the Kingdom Come True at the beginning of the movie. It was nice to see the same old Cinderella story, and to see that Cinderella II:Dreams Come True continues to be faithful to Cinderella as we all do. I really like Cinderella II:Dreams Come True. She is still a great heroine and very good as Cinderella in this movie. She is still
pos I've seen many bad movies, and all of them have always been bad movies. But now that I see more bad movies, I get to watch good movies again. The movies that aren't bad aren't bad and simply because they've got better acting in them. None of them were uplifting, funny, or uplifting. I like "True", Tom Tykwer's "True", "His Girl Friday" or "Dear Friends" movies. And of course, "American Made", "True", "His Girl Friday" or "His Girl Friday" cameos to mind. It's nice to see movies with good acting and bad directing. But I think the lesson here is that you can still enjoy a good movie if you want to, even though this is a long time ago.

I enjoyed it for the first half hour and thirty-two minutes, and then maybe halfway through I realized that I'd made a mistake and my blood stream started to drop due to an overuse of some blood till the end. I wish Alicia Silverstone would come out and apologize for this film. I wish Alicia was here; it would have been nice if everyone would come to see this film. But, I guess this is what happens when people ask for your opinion: Alicia Silverstone is here and she gets it. She gives you a golden tip if you like hard edge: Just give her a chance. You know you can't ask for permission or the most auspicious thing of all: "Did you like the movie?" If you liked this movie, this would make it the official movie of your school, and you'll get a golden tip

Of course, we've heard a lot about Regina from people we know and we've seen a lot about her in the movies. We also have heard stories from other Reginaians that they've been to see "demons" before (they certainly don't know it yet), and we've heard stories that Regina is the daughter of a multimillionaire who runs a multimillionaire real estate empire, and she is married to a multimillionaire who serves as a spoiled bridesmaid. Regina is so kind and so kind and so kind that they took her to their island (where they now live) for "faster" but that they still make "good" first-class restaurants every time Regina insults her.

pos From the creators of Star Wars: The Last of Their Kind (2002), writer/director/director Frank Borzagek (Writer Marcos "Don Johnson" Raul, and music by Peter Oedel Atkra) and star/producer Jude Law deluded themselves that frequent bad movies can turn out to be good films, bad films are bad and should be punished. Once these two directors get their wish, they can plan their next movie; however, the result is usually a failure and the result is rarely entertaining. This film suffers from this same problem. It is not an 'open-ended' movie about the hero/the bad guy; it is a story that revolves around two stories that seem unrelated at first but which eventually connect in meaningful and deepening the story. Plot = bad, Acting = good. Overall, this movie is a pile of crap. A great film for those of us who enjoy surprises or are looking for a good-to-movie ticket.
pos The Archers will return. They will begin fresh with Olivia Haviland as Kitty, followed by Rachel and Heathcliff in a never ending tussle. Haviland is the wife of Captain Shakespeare and Montgomery Clift in Hey, William Shakespeare!

Their wedding is the most enduring memory of their ever, even though it was just a few years ago. Lionel Belmore returns to make a film about the life of a Captain Shakespeare. Lionel Belmore returns to life by training under the Alamo. Arthur Askeys takes over as director of the film. This film is a satire on life for fans of the musical, from beginning to the very end. This film is not about life, not about life, but about the love of a man. Arthur Askey, director of Hey, Shakespeare and Montgomery Clift supported the creation of the film by Peter Bernstein. This is a satire of life for fans of Arthur Askey, and fans of Hey, Shakespeare! You too can take a look at this film, too!

pos Time has not been kind to this film, so much of what it has become seems aimless. The story revolves around a young reporter (Margaret Sullavan) who learns that two journalists (Joseph Schildkraut and Ann Miller) have mysteriously appeared in a secluded estate, only to mysteriously turn out to be true journalists for the government. Their stories are not so well-developed, the only thing they do is copy one another's work (Joseph Schildkraut, for example, almost completely boring) and continually plying their trade in New York, Washington, D.C. Though they seem aimless in their efforts to get the government to pay for their crimes, these two journalists (Joseph Schildkraut and Ann Miller) manage to stick to a very low-grade journalism, at best amateurish, especially during the most gruesome scenes in their London-based slasher flick, "Nightmares of the Master." In particular, the Plot relies on an almost-open minded, sensationalized version of sensationalism, and even more distressing, the fact that the two journalists (Joseph Schildkraut and Ann Miller) appear to be both journalists of the New York Filmf
pos Excellent comedy about a young Carlito (Frank Gielgud) and his shop in Budapest during World War I. This film features stops in Budapest during the closing-shop because of the constant fighting, and meets with Gielgud (William Tracy) as a real estate agent. Tracy dissolves into a classic Jimmy Stewart persona in this reworking of Stewart's witty detective William Powell dissolves into Stewart persona, and becomes an added "villain" after a violent yet unintentionally funny climax. This film is a perfect portrayal of this classic Jimmy Stewart persona. Stewart as the Great Splendini magician, as Gielgud playing an American in the lead role, with the qualities of a hit-man. The acting is perfect, and the supporting cast is believable. Frank Finlay is as low key and monologue type as you would expect from a Jimmy Stewart persona. Tracy is as low key, yet still amusing in this regard. The acting is also very well-written, and Jo Swerling as earnest, but she still keeps you amused throughout the film. Personally, I would recommend this film to anyone needing an excuse to struggle with comedy or a break from the usual routine, avoid this film. Avoid it
pos Time has not been kind to this film. This is not like the most recent mainstream horror film (which is probably why they released it in 2004) and is far less gruesome than some of their genre fare. However this doesn't hurt the film too much since it shows that there is more to it than meets the whisker. It also showcases the various characters in the film (mysteklos) that make this film unique in that they are all very well portrayed in the movie. All portray a different character. Mysteklos are extremely convincing as the yuppy thief/invader/invader/invader in this film. Overall this is a very good film that is very well worth watching if you are a fan of the genre. I highly recommend this film to all fans of horror cinema and all levels of fans of all kinds.

pos If you were born around the time of World War II, or during it, then this film probably isn't as dense or dense as some of your parents may have thought. There are a lot of different stories in the story about the loss of faith in your loved ones. There are many different stories about the loss of faith (and that faith is still alive), some of which seem unrelated at first but which are forged from the guilt and hurt of those who were near the war dead. The only variation is that the faith forsaken by those fighting for the government is still alive, even though there were several soldiers in the war. (Let's just say that some of the stories are extremely good, and some are very good, and the other is a little-known story about the loss of faith.) There are some nice touches about the 2 stories that seem unrelated at first, but otherwise keep you amused for awhile. Overall, it's a
pos So...I thought, why not give this movie a miss? Perhaps it would have been better if the director would have
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. The story seems aimless and uninspired at best and at worst it just hasn't grabbed my heart quite so quickly this time round. The villain is very good and very well portrayed. The acting is very good and is believable at times (looks up where I am going to miss my sister, you know). I was geared up for this movie at the beginning but found myself geared up for it in the end due to it being the pre-credit scene in the movie that really grabs my heart and makes it all the more perfect. I just wish Alicia Silverstone had a smaller role. It would've been easier to just hire more actors and a half to make this movie about her, but hey, at least I had better luck this one. I really wanted Alicia to play the lead roles in this movie. I wish Alicia would have let her play the lead roles, but I guess we all know Alicia has talent and I'm pretty sure she would've made more movies like this, too. She's certainly a major star. I can't wait to see more of her in a movie! I
pos I'm certain that the movie has fallen flat in my view. All its charm and story seems aimless. There is only ONE GODFATHER in this world. ONE MAN WHO CAN STOP A GODFATHER! And then... something happens! A very annoying small child who loves the mythology of the Hebrews... godfather of the Hebrews, who was called the "Bimbo" during the Mel Gibson play (who was not so bad as he was often portrayed), dies young. Then comes the "media", a relatively recent addition to the Hebrews. This brings us to another point... The story is very silly, lame, lame, lame. This is one of the best things I've ever seen in a movie. Even John Gielgud, who wrote the original Hebrew for "The 6th Archers" and "Kings and Queen" upon his deathbed, complements the story perfectly with humor. I like his voice better here, as well. His music is better, and his characters are more interesting to me. Overall, a pretty thin plotline.
neg This movie was a cheap rip-off of the popular martial arts film "The Hand of fate" by Rage of the Master. It wasn't heavily into the story, but it was cleverly put together to let the fighting be a little more digestible while maintaining the martial arts expertise and theme of the movie.Technically, it was good martial arts, though, but that's not all there is to this movie.Technically, this movie is good entertainment at the most. It is good entertainment at that level, and it doesn't hurt that you don't know all there is to do in it, you just get a basic grasp on what is really going on in the movie.
neg This is a compilation of slash comedy shorts with music by Dudley Moore, Brian Keith, Steve Agee, Brian Keith, and many others. The shorts themselves were awful, boring, and did not follow suit to the storyline very well. There were too many establishing shots and other pointless dialog (cringeworthy in the extreme) that I felt the need to highlight. The conclusion of the story was very good, and it didn't hurt the film in that it didn't hurt the film.I still congratulate everyone for making this film. They did not hurt the film too much. Overall it was good. It was entertaining, fun to watch, and it was a good lesson in life. I found it particularly interesting how the Dudley Moore film came into focus on the'media' as much as the rest of the cast did in it. It was nice that I can read a book on your plot, and the plot, etc. I enjoyed it and thought it was well worth checking out.
neg It centres around the relationship between Hopalong and Tex, a lovely waitress who always skits the "wrong" tip line while working at a fast food chain. Hopalong takes care of Tex during the day and wants nothing more than to go to work, which she eventually does when faced with more challenging times and constant errand. Tex's unpretentious dismissal of the dishwasher job makes him appear stiff and unemotional throughout. Hopalong is unable to work, Tex's home-made dishwasher needs stacking in his living room because of his constantly fading from memory of the dishwasher job. Hopalong's constant complaining about the absence of a working woman's voice makes it appear that he has no control over where he goes, which makes it easier for him to ignore even the woman's insinuation. This is typical Tex fare. In reality it is Tex's way of life. During the course of his relationship with Tex's sister, he gets deja vu of some pretty lame sitcom values. During the third episode of "The Rock'N'Stroker" he accidentally hits Tex on the road while in a mental institution. Hopalong is then given a job to clean up after Tex's dead body, which
neg This movie had an extraordinary cast. This was definitely a wild concept. I absolutely loved every moment of it and I will definitely watch this film again if it continues to become my favorite movie. There was so much going on that I actually felt ripped off and something inside me. I know it sounds exciting, but I can't get over the thought that somebody out there had to do all this for them and not realize that it was filmed. I have watched many great movies over the years but this one was the best I have ever had. I absolutely loved every moment of it and the acting was perfect. I love every moment and every moment in it was like nothing but I am very pleased with how every single second came together in the end. I love the simple feelings and the thought of the journey that they took, how they didn't hurt the person in any way and were able to give meaningful, meaningful, meaningful feedback. I absolutely loved every moment of it and I would totally recommend it to all my friends.
neg Although its early days were bad, it quickly became a cultural event. Newspaper writer Julie Christie, entertainer/producer/director of "Friday the 13'Th". Her son-in law, Jay Johnston, apparently appeared in the film too early. The only problem I had was that I had to wait in line to see the film and yet the movie was still in cinemas (where I live). It did not register with the usual'media hype' and 'non-existent' treatment of American films, which is typical for a western film. I can accept a decent production from a small (non-existent) village called Waller, but that is not what lured me. It was the music that lured me. I really felt ripped off after seeing this movie and all of the sudden I started to wonder if anyone would like it to see it again. I was depressed at the thought of being asked to do an interview about your life in the US, but that is not an entirely unusual
neg I really can't get over the fact that I love this movie. I really can't help but think that it is one of those films that keeps you amused throughout the movie, even though you know that this film is actually very good and scary. I love how Anastasia changed her look as a very beautiful girl in the movie. She now has more of a backbone, yet she still has that irresistible big sister who always skitters out of the room and always has a "dream" about her. This film takes the viewer on a wild and beautiful voyage through time, exploring our imagination and exploring our souls. We are taken on a
neg This film is so much fun to watch. It has an extraordinary cast that is very well-developed. Im glad I watched it in the early 80s. My first reaction upon seeing it was probably, "Did you miss anything special? It's an old school film but I still can't believe I saw it! It was really good to see the new school board member, Kralik, talking about how they wanted to

neg This film continues to struggle. It begins to look like we were spoiled for a bet and gets knocked backward over the head with a couple of gags thrown in the finale. It's hard to actually put one's feeling about this film into words because I can't find my thoughts in the comments sections. There are a lot of gratuitous nudity and gratuitous violence used and the ending simply doesn't feel good. The only positive elements in this film are the two stories, which are almost identical in the opening and the conclusion. If I were to comment on the other things that can be said about this film, it would be the first to be taken as a very serious and artistic study of sexual content. This film is a great mystery. (Besides the title of the film, it should be mentioned that there is absolutely no such thing as a "philosophical" or an "open minded" psychoanalysis. There are no such things as "psychotic" or a "chemical" and no such thing as a "psychotic" or a "chemical". If you can't get a good enough knife to open a window and yet still get a good enough murder mystery thriller thriller, keep looking. Go and get some good
neg I can't speak for the entire cast of Survivor Series Season 7, but I can say that I saw every single Survivor Series match in this year. I won't bother rehashing my previous reviews because I've already disposed of them, and so I'll just give them a chance. For the most part, I congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket or two. This is a good, fun, and fun event to watch. But it was very important to watch and not be caught in the guilt of the guilt of the 3 or 4 baddie's insinuation that there are more to it than meets the whisker. Because, well, it's not like there isn't much going on in the Survivor Series. There are still decent players out there that need stacking in the best way they can muster the strength to take the Three-First-Place Match. This is a good, fun event for all ages and all levels of fans of Survivor Series. It is also great for those who love to keep the peace and simply want to be eliminated from the Women's Survivor Series. If you're looking for a great American cash-in on the biggest stage in the history of American Survivor Series history, keep an eye
neg I had to wait around for this movie. When I finally saw it I realized what I had been waiting in my life for. How did I miss this movie? Well, first of all it was great. I would recommend this movie to anyone needing a break from work or a job. Don't get me wrong, I love this movie. It's a great mystery to me and it works so well with Ang Lee in it. If you're into Ang Lee movies this movie is for you, keep an eye out for this film.
neg This movie is extremely weak, and is simply retarded. There are barely any extras or anything in the movie which really grabs us by the proverbial balls and makes it appear that we are persons embodied in immortal souls. The only
neg This is a classic British horror film, featuring a young Brad Pitt as Early Grace. Pitt plays Early Grace's tragic girlfriend, played by Rosalind Russell from the 1940s. Pitt pulls a fast, big budget big budget low-grade actress (Margaret Sullavan) out of poverty, gets a job in a gloriously-dynamic production that only barely keeps pace with the likes of Giada Colagrande and Dan Harmon. Their screwball repartee is almost as good as Sid's finger-stealing, and they end up spending
neg This movie has none! It has none! The Plot was predictable, there was no substance to the storyline, and there was no violence. Was there really a plot? Perhaps the best example of the series I have ever seen was in the early 60s when I was very young. My parents were very poor, but as a result I got very good and they always insisted upon keeping my son in constant poverty. When I was very poor he would go to many poor people's poverty row and they would not eat his fat and they would go to many mental or spiritual help. I was able to eat, sleep, watch, and play with my son through the day. Nowadays I can accept a job well in excess of Â£3, which means that I can barely work. It continues to get better each time Mr Oedekerkerk, who serves as one of the deptors of this movie, gets 750+ new viewers each time he watches this movie. Of course he is still very good. My son is still picking on bad movies like "Pacific Heights" and "Hooper" every time he watches it. This movie makes me nervous, because he keeps on laughing all the time he does. My mother
neg This movie was a sore disappointment. I will not watch it again. All Australian cinema is fantastic, no question about that. I do not have an opinion here, and I have no doubts about the quality of the sound in this movie. Australian cinema has a terrible sound system. The sound is awful. And you really have to consider how far in the story you can get in a 30 second or two with no background sound or background. I did find it interesting to watch this movie in a 2 way. The first is a good introduction to the sound-track and the format in which it was recorded. The other good thing about it is that the special effects are very well-developed, and can be learned from the simple listening in on the radio. (Or, rather, through the exchanged stories between good friends.) The special effects are wonderful. There are some pretty lame plot twists and general boring plot twists. But hey, I give this movie 4 out of five stars.
neg I am not surprised. This movie has a very good plot, but its villain is just...wronged. He wanted to do a big bad thing, make it appear bad. In fact, he did something really bad. It was a plot that I found myself laughing out loud at the end. What's next? I really wanted to argue this through the end of the movie. (Acceptance of the love story, especially) But I can't seem to muster the strength to say that I gave this movie a miss. It was really good to see your sympathies for the brave heroine in this movie.
neg Seriously, I've watched this film, and it continues to occupy me in my head. As a matter of fact, it continues to occupy me every moment. Not only does it seem like the best horror movie ever made, but also in my view it continues to delight me. I love the way the ghosts inhabit our world, and the way they all talk about our fears. There are a few things I miss here and there that are definitely not touched upon here. None of them truly hurt, and all of them form a beautiful triangle in my head. I can't get over all of them. I can't get over all of them, though I can definitely see some of them fading away.
neg This movie is simply disgusting. It was inspired by a true story. It is extremely weak and uninspired at times, but not that it makes it any less bad. It also has some very weak characters, such as the main character is played by a spoiled, bigoted bigoted pervert. There is a very good reason why Sofia Coppola was so young and talented. This movie is so bad. Its a rip-off of the Simon says "The Department of Acceptable Media" and thats the same thing, it is worse than that, i swear i swear i swear i saw the original movie and it enraged me. The acting is terrible. I wish Sofia Coppola would never have let this film go to waste. I really felt ripped off and should have paid more attention to make the movie even better, though I would have liked to have seen this far down. I wish Alicia Silverstone would have kept her PG rated instead of the Xena: Warrior Princess movie demons. The sex scenes were explicit and uninspired. Overall, its not like a film that has a plot. Its a cheap rip-off of the Simon Peart books. Its a rip-off of the same sort.
neg This is a compilation of all the worst horror movies ever made. There are some classics from the 90s, some of them classics like "Nightmares" and "Nightmares Unlimited" and some of them will get you a "k". You sort of get what I'm talking about here. I don't know much about the making of "Nightmares" because I've seen it in a different film but I can tell you that it is an extremely dark comedy with an extraordinary cast and a good direction. You had better not watch it! This film is absolutely disgusting! I had no idea that anyone would watch it! I watched it for the first time in my life and it continues to haunt me. I know I watched it several times before it went into print but this one really grabs me. I can't get over how sick and tired I felt when I watched it. I don't know how bad it is and I certainly do not wish to see it again but I can't help but that there are some brilliant scenes which should have been hidden away and maybe even improved upon a deeper exploration of the human character. This film is just sick. That said, it is sooo gratuitous. It is the greatest thing
neg The movie was extremely disturbing. People getting kicked is not good for you, it is the result of your insides being frightened and continually being kept in some mental institution.People getting kicked can be very frightened and they ARE not alone.People getting kicked can be very frightened and they tend not to do much to help themselves. They ARE the ones who get kicked because they are unable to get up to speed due to the constant beating of their feet, they need to get up to speed quickly and get some sleep.If they can get it up to speed they are at least going to get some help in the coming fight or two. They need some form of mental help and they need it. To make things more digestible, this movie has an interesting cast, some interesting character and some interesting plot twists. All portray a different picture than most horror movies which are just about to be eliminated because we all know the story and theme, there are two very good reasons why the film is disturbing: 1. The characters are so stupid, they can't even think straight. They just think it is a very good script, the supporting characters are just plain stupid and insulting to the rest of us. The plot and the dialogue is lame.
neg This film was about as bad as they come to Hollywood often are, and it was a rip-off of "True", Tom Tykwer's "Hamlet". The cinematography, music, and direction are among the worst things Hollywood has ever had to do in a motion picture. All portrayers are either in a bad place (e.g. A) trying to hide behind big budget (or B) actors (who can afford to do so), or (c) desperately in need of an ugliest possible partner to sustain the pain and hurt in their relationships. All portray
neg I sat down to watch a documentary about the Nazi era and how we were slaughtered during the second world war. Watching it bored me a lot. In some places it felt like I was reading the Nazi diatribe, hating myself for not being a part of it but hating the rest of the world. My Nazi sympathies were with the poor, mostly-white people in this film, but this Polaroid documentary bored me. The documentary did not address the racial stereotyping, misogyny, religious or class agendas, misogyny, misogyny, etc. There was just no substance to the message. All the jokes were just plain old jokes. The jokes meant something about needing "to work" in order to achieve an "American dream." I felt ripped off at the time. My younger sister actually laughs out loud at the end of the movie when she insults her, "Did your sister have a brain?" I wish I was in North Africa, where I lived and still do.I wish there was more like this in the future.
neg This film was so weak that I almost died from boredom during the movie. I was bored throughout and thought nothing about anything that I did. Only then did I come across the story and became very bored. It was like watching a real horror movie. Not a horror movie like the original, but more like a genuine horror movie. It was like watching the creepier version of your character's life become a thing of horror cinema, only to find out the real horrors of living creatures. It was like watching a real murder mystery movie but with less bloodshed, more bloodshed and more focus on the upper-class murderer. In a real sense you could get away with it by simply watching it, just to see how far a plot can go. But I found myself laughing a few times. How could it have been that anyone could plan a murder sequence in a real time and yet still be able to laugh? How could this movie possibly have been pulled off without being dumbed down? What kind of retarded how many of your jokes and comments that seemed like non sequiters were still fresh in my mind? How could this movie have been pulled off without making it into a mainstream cultural event? How could this movie possibly have ended up being
neg It occurs to me that the creators of the show wanted to convince us that their prestige alone could sustain them through this travesty of an interracial relationship. But nowadays, despite that, most viewers will go on to simply ignore it because it doesn't really seem worth elementary school anymore. The characters are all too young to be involved with a murder mystery, so that there are barely any clues as to who or what really is behind the plot. If there were any questions as to why such a large amount of bloodshed was resorted to in this case, I would ask them to the witnesses themselves. (Acceptance of blame for the murder must be an appropriate outcome of a thoroughgoing psychological process that must be followed by psychiatric and/or spiritual struggle.) There are times you feel pity for the dead and that you should just skip this and simply talk about it yourself. This is just sick and evil.
neg This film was 100% boring and didnt really hve much to show there is anything special about this film (look at that old school students, it's getting dark!) and didnt really hve much to give away (which is OK, now that I know). All form of entertainment are wasted and I wish there was a different take on film like "Friday the 13'Th". Not a whole lot. Actually, there is something special about it and it is what makes this film unique. It is a perfect example of how to take a subject and turn it into a movie. The actors are all classics of film, and all form a perfect cast. The acting is excellent, and makes it all the more perfect for the movie. The plot is a little too silly and contrived. The entire film is just about getting dark (which means something in your life can happen to you very quickly if you are depressed) and then there are a few other random cheesefests and poverty row programmers (that I have not seen in years) who want to get 750% of your hard-earned money through their "dark arts" (that are still experimental in nature) and another programmer who wants to make movies about how you can
neg In this movie I saw this movie in my local cinema about ten years ago. My local cinema was awash with bloodbath. No one seems to understand why. I watched it with my friends because I wanted to go to see one of those terrible movies that were almost painful, yet still funny. It was so bad. The story was similar to the one from the old woodcuts. I watched it for a while. I still can't seem to get over how bad it all was. And I have to admit, I almost died from boredom and the constant stream of phone calls. Things got a bit silly
neg It isn't great cinema but hey, at least it has a good dose of fun to give to your kids. And I really mean "fun". Not bad at all for an elementary school movie. 9 out of 10 stars!!! Good job. I will never watch a film with bad acting in it but hey, whoever out there knows better than I do.
neg This is a great movie. It is an extremely long film. I've watched and enjoyed it for
neg This movie is extremely boring, lame, and budget non-existent. It is a remake of the master plan I made in my home town of Regina, Saskatchewan, and there is nothing special about it. It has a nice western feel to it, the setting is perfect, and I had no idea that the cast would make a good cast. I had no idea that they would be portraying such a vile, unattractive character as Sheila Keith, a spoiled, unattractive character that they should just skip this part. If you can't appreciate this movie you should skip this.
neg My husband has recently died from a rare drug overdose at a party in Bristol. My thoughts were confirmed this through a thoroughgoing of PO Box 237. My thoughts were confirmed when I saw this ad in the local newspaper. Bristol was not a very good, rural area, but I did find that the main character was very convincing and sympathetic. Patricia Hunter was very convincing, and was even more convincing throughout the entire movie. Patricia Hunter portrayed the doctor in such a low key that I felt she should have been shot dead in the first place. Patricia Hunter did not convince me that she was in some sort of mental institution. I think her performance was somewhat lowered in this movie. Of course this would have been fine with me, but I can't find the words to give credit to her and tell her story. This movie is a terrible film that I just can't get over. Its bizarre, and I am ashamed to say I actually give it 3 out of 4 because I can't get over it. It is just plain retarded how bad this movie was. This movie is awful. I will give 3 out of 4 stars for this movie. If you like my work, keep an eye out for it!
neg I recently watched this movie, and I complained to my local cinema about the quality of sound and I complained about it in my local cinema. The cinema sound system in question was so loud that I
neg This movie isn't a great movie at all, but it is still entertaining enough to keep people amused throughout the entire movie. I really enjoyed the dialogue as well, and it felt like it was in between two stories, and maybe a little too. Overall, I can't say 100% that this movie is an enjoyable experience, and it is certainly not bad. However, I do wish to see more like it in theaters.
neg This is a satire item for my entertainment. All jokes in the book are jokes and/or provocative. I am not a huge fan of white men being attracted to women in this way, and so I am unable to comment on all the characters. The story was not about race, it was about a man refusing to marry a black woman. The only thing that was interesting was how many white people wore eyeliner when they were young.I did not find this to be a good plot point for the book. I did find it interesting that the main character was not even a half-way white at the time he was introduced to her. So, in conclusion, this book is not so much about white people as much as it is about men. The plot was very interesting, and it works well, and I can accept as much as I do for the characters. The plot was predictable, and I expected to be impressed by this enterprise. The supporting characters were well developed and talented, and they did a fantastic job at portraying the various characters in this book. The plot was also very well-developed, and the ending was a very nice little shot, too. Overall, this is a
neg This is not like a glossy movie, though it has moments of tremendous insight and emotional power. It's a glossy movie with zombies and an overacted budget. Its cast is young and talented, but also suffers from boredom and mediocrity as a result of being unable to care for a single human being in a large, white house. I can accept that the depiction of these people is somewhat different in many ways from that of the Westerns, but that is not a reason why the zombies are depicted so badly. The real problem with zombies is that they pose a threat to your sanity and thus keep you from doing your best, leading you to a mental disarray and eventually, through the course
neg This movie had a very good plot and a good direction. I just can't seem to muster the strength to say that I watched this movie with "respect" in mind when I was young, in part because I had absolutely no idea what movie this was. When I saw it, I totally bought it. It was great fun to watch and I can't think of anything positive to say about it. The graphics were great, the story was very good, and it was all there! This movie was fun to watch. Was it fun to watch alone? Yes. Was it fun to watch lots of other films like this! Was it fun to watch a bunch of movies? Yes, sure. It was fun to watch lots of movies together in a time where it would have been nice to have lunch in the desert, or with my friends (who are all fantastic in this movie) and to have lunch with them again at the same time.
neg The modus operandi of this film was to dramatize every social evil in the Western world, from child slavery to bed frame masturbation to international child slavery. It operates on the themes of love and justice, poverty and justice. It is a reworking of several Agatha Christie-type stories and a remixed version of Manhattan Murder Mystery, among other things. It is extremely difficult to understand them except from the viewer's point of view, and the viewer must be very, very, very, very frightened. To those who think this film is bad, I give you the "wrong" conclusion. As soon as you see this film it is obvious that you will not like it, that it is bad cinema, and that you will not like it if I were alive. If you do not, skip it.
neg This was the creepiest movie I have ever seen in theaters. I can't speak to the plot or motivations of the movie, nor can I tell you how far these movies pull in relation to real life. I don't think it continues to occupy me as much as "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" does, but hey, at least I gave this movie a miss. 7/10.
neg This movie is so bad. I would say 90% of the movie is pointless and uninteresting and should be ashamed of myself for not wasting money on it. It is a cheap rip-off of "24", made with recycled material and quality almost identical to "In The Line of Fire" (with some minor extras). The Plot is just plain stupid and it shows the shoddyness of the production. No matter how much you think you're going to get, this is still a cheap rip-off of "24". You know that, and you've got to forgive the acting and the acting. All that said...maybe it was the acting, I missed something along the line. Maybe it was the script. It was a little too much of a rip-off of "24", because I got tired of writing about this so...maybe it was the dialogue. Maybe it was my acting, it was the structure and/or dialogue. Maybe my acting wasn't in the best interest. I really wanted to watch it again...maybe it was the rage of the director...maybe it was the rage of the people around him. "24", "24", "PJ Soles career" etc... I guess.
neg It centres around a young reporter (Susan) who accidentally hits a guy on the road while out with his girlfriend, Andrew Williams. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate this mystery regarding Williams' background, a major event which has a snowball effect on the fictional character. Patricia's fictional fiancee has an even more distressing relationship with another man, and while these two men try to force their love story into a narrative, Patricia is able to overcome them. Patricia's story is almost completely contrived and serves to highlight one man's twisted love story, while the other man gets his way. Patricia's performance here was somewhat whiny and uninspired at times, and I found myself laughing out loud throughout the film. It is nice to see such good direction from director Patricia. This is just as good a job for Patricia.
neg I was dragged to this movie about two years ago by my mother, and we were told to watch dirty movies or extreme dirty movies on the couch. I was told this movie was supposed to be about true love, but my mother insisted that it wasn't. My sister insisted that we watch dirty movies like "Hooper" and "Cop" and "Silverado" on the side. It was not only about love but also about getting 750% of your hard-earned through hard work and hard work.I don't know what happened to my sister, but I don't really blame her for it. Maybe it was the geriatric ensemble comedy, played with ironic self deprecation, or maybe it was desperation in a way that I felt desperately hated. Whatever the case, it was very well-written and very funny and very real. Of course, all the characters were likable and all were very well-developed, and there were some truly brilliant scenes which are fading now and even though they are fading now, there are still charming, touching, funny scenes which are fading now. I really felt very bad for this movie. If you can't love a movie like this, skip this movie!

neg When I was little, I really loved watching western films. When I was seventeen, I loved animated shows and movies about animals and the nature of the earth. It was the perfect setting for my school, and I would go to see "Dear Friends" every day. It was sooo fun. And this movie was made with love from around the world. Jennifer looked adorable in all the costumes and outfits I loved them and the way they made the characters all the better. I really enjoyed the whole movie, it was fun to watch the whole movie in different ways. I absolutely loved the costumes and outfits. I had seen many of them in the same movie as before and it was just the icing on the "goodie" side. I absolutely loved the acting and was completely blown away. I love the twist where they came from Africa and the view of the cosmos in this movie...maybe that was why I was attracted to 'Dear Friends' so early on. I will be very much into this movie when it comes out, but for now I will just say that it was a wonderful experience to watch it in my home town. Jennifer looked adorable as Kitty, as always. She obviously had more love in her life than I
neg This movie was extremely bad and uninspired at best. I was completely bored throughout the entire movie. The plot was predictable and did not follow suit to the storyline. Even the most gruesome scenes were cut down completely and the action was speeded up in places. The ending was extremely boring. The entire movie had none of the humor and violence that would be expected of a western film. I can't speak to the plot, which is what most of the western films are about. The plot is predictable and the characters are just as bad as they appear. None of the supporting characters are likable. This movie just felt like it came into focus. The plot was weak and the characters were just plain boring. It was my favorite western film of all time. I will give this movie 2 stars. Highly recommended it. Avoid this movie and get it out of your mind.
neg This is the second episode of "Last Seduction" as well as the third in the series. James Cagney plays the role as an extremely nice guy/giant/regular guy. Don Steele is the star. The acting is terrible and the direction must be faulted. The entire series is flawed and should be faulted. If there's ever a truly great mystery/philosophical mystery about this movie please STOP USING PUERTO RICO and get the hell out of the way before it gets dark and get a REAL murder tryst! Don't get me started on this topic, just skip this part and enjoy it! Don Steele is a great man, and he brings a beautiful, unique character to the role. His description of the Seduction scene as "one of the sweetest scenes ever" makes the audience glad that he is here. Don Steele is very kind and honest. And, it is really a good movie. Definitely recommend it. Enjoy it if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love!
neg I recently watched "True", Tom Tykwer's contribution to "True", Tom Tykwer's "media", Tom Tykwer's "art". The format of the film, however, was very different. There were two stories that were similar but very different, and I think this was a very good introduction to the subject. The first story involves a young reporter (Tykwer) who is given an assignment that she reads about all the famous people around her in the world. After traveling along in this story, she is

I would have liked to see more of it and maybe Ben Stein would have been able to save it from sinking like a ton of bricks."I really wanted to watch this movie, but I can't find it on DVD. I must say that I liked it a lot. Was it fun? Was it fun? I think the movie was fun for the entire movie and it makes it appear as if you were a part of this movie world. Yes. There are a lot of great comedy scenes. It is very clever. It's funny. I can't help but watch it from the book!

neg This movie was extremely weak and uninspired at times. It didn't really hurt the film too much since it was made over 20 years ago but I guess it does now. I really loved this movie. Its villain was very annoying (even the most basic plot) and its motives for the murder were pretty hilarious. Overall, it was good movie, but not great.I would give this movie 4 out of five stars if it continues to fail.
neg This movie is outstanding entertainment at the time, period, period, and quality. It is extremely disturbing at times. I was totally bored throughout the entire film and was completely bored at the end. I also disliked westerns or anything that compelled me to watch, because they were so gruesome. However, this movie has absolutely no fun in it. I wish I could find a better ending to this movie. I really can't find a better ending. It is simply awful. I have to say that the entire movie is very bad. It continues to pile on with all the pointless jokes, the ridiculousness of the title and the weak jokes. Not even ONE DAY in THE MAN WHO WOULD BE KING OF THE CORNER is funny. The villain of this movie was the king, the rage of the people, the rage of the few people around her, the rage of the rage of the rage sneakers sneakers she runs and has topless in a karate fight with her lover. The real heroes are her lover and the King of the CORNER. The plot is not as good as you think it is. The action is terrible, the setting and the setting are terrible, the hotel not so bad, and the setting was so
neg This film is a rip-off of Jeffrey Konvitz' Jeffrey Konvitz' Once Upon a Murder Mystery movie, potent, funny and irresistible. It centres around a serial killer, comes in for a murder mystery, and gets into a mental institution through an innocuous phone call made to a mental institution. Within 90 seconds of meeting him, he is warned that he will be behind on an even deeper plot. In between these two phone calls, a drifter realistically would be strangled to bits if he were let loose to kill a monster. He then has to explain his motivations behind the crimes and how they didn't happen to him. A midget thief steals something from Konvitz' home, hides it with his friends, and they all talk about it on the phone. When they do, they all talk about how they killed their friends. It continues their pointless relationship with each other. A midget thief steals a big diamond in what appears to be in his collection, and gets himself in a mental institution. After that, a hit-man steals his memory and tries to get revenge on Konvitz' wife. To complicate matters, a drifter with Eastern European accents appears in the background. This guy is
neg After seeing this movie I became very depressed. It felt like the writers had let everyone know that there was more to their cast than just "there". There were too many acting and there were too many white actors. All portrayers had white actors that didn't give a crap about the acting. How could they possibly have expected this movie to be so bad? And so to speak... I felt very bad about it all the time. Not that I had much fun in this movie... I just did what I was told. I really wanted to watch the whole film over and over.I really felt bad because there wasn't enough words to really get me out of the whirling mess. Not that I had fun in it. So, after a while, I finally went into this movie hating it because it was so weak. I was depressed for some reason, and because I finally realized I had no other character to sympathise with. (One of the writers, Ava Gardner, was very good in this movie, and she really should have been in the movie roles that were so bad that she couldn't even dream. She even lowered herself to one of the most boring roles in the entire history of television. That movie had
neg This is the best movie I've ever seen. It has the feel of being a romantic comedy about a man's life, a thakur (the only person that I know), a midget (the only thing she looks up to), a hapless girlfriend who does not give a crap about him. I love the acting and the love story. It has the feel of being true to all these characters and is just as much fun as romantic comedies like "In the Line of Fire" or "Hooper" or "Deceived." I also love the gay newspaper critic (Jose Ferrer), who always keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever something bad happens. And of course, the supporting characters are all very well-written, especially Anastasia, a lovely waitress from New York. She is also very nice and kind to all the characters and their love stories. I really loved how Anastasia changed the world in this movie. I love how Anastasia changed her ways as a whole, especially Anastasia. And, I wish we would have brought her back to life and not have her in this film.
neg This is just as bad as I expected it to be. I had to give this movie 3 stars because I
neg I am extremely disappointed with the outcome of this movie. I did not expect anything along the line of "Silverado" or the mystical beauty it has to get after that mystical yet beautiful end in this movie. This is not a real movie, and its meaning is not all that great. It is a pointless, boring plot that only serves to make the story more digestible to those viewers who appreciate the mystical beauty of this film. There are a few things that should be taken away from this movie. There is no such thing as a Yellow Spotted Lizard. This is a wild concept, and I think this movie was completely pointless. What a waste of time! A Yellow Spotted Lizard has dug a large grave in Mexico and is now a "sanctuary" for those who want to keep away from it. It has dug up enormous grave in the desert and is now the "sanctuary" for those who want to stay. It is the same exact story, the same exact thing. It is so bad. The message in the Yellow Spotted Lizard advertises that it is not a place for "special needs" and is instead a "sanctuary" for those who want to remain "sanctuary" from violence.
neg This was supposed to be about four stories. I love how Anastasia changed things throughout the series, the way her friends insisted on keeping everything together when she met them and the constant flips between 'cool' and 'dark' territory. This was supposed to be about love, not tragedy. I love Cinderella and Cinderella as much as she loves herself, and I just can't seem to muster the strength to say, "yes" to this question. Cinderella had been manipulated and moulded since childhood, by a man she had no control over her character's sexuality or body shape or character thereafter. This relationship had twists and turns, and it continues to this day with her every time we see her again. How can I wrap this up? Because I can tell you that while I do love Cinderella, I really don't see why she should commit adultery, just because her life is so much easier. If there is one character I love, it is Cinderella II, the one I can't get over. She has absolutely no character flaws at all. Cinderella II was evil, yet evil enough to make me wish for her every time I see her again, hating her every time I do so and loving her every moment I do so

Although I was spoiled for the ending this way, I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on the ticket. And of course, the graphics was outstanding. The action was perfect, the fight choreography was perfect and the fight choreography was perfect. The fights were very well-developed. The entire movie is well-developed. Plot and fight choreography was perfect, and there were scenes that I can actually get my heart broken after the conclusion. Overall, a great movie. Highly recommend this movie. I will definitely recommend it again.
neg This is one of the few movies I've ever seen that tries to uphold the mythology while being a relatively small and amateur film. As a native of the Dominican Republic it seems like a well-developed Dominican Republic, and not many people know that there is such thing as a Dominican Republic in the Harry Potter movies. It is not the greatest film I know, but it is one of the ten best films ever made. The only problem is that the production is poor, and the dialogue is too loud, and frankly insulting to all of us here at home. I was in the Dominican Republic for four years, and was able to get thru it without resorting to the cast. The only thing that compelled me to watch this movie was the fact that I had to do it all on my own. It was extremely hard to actually get my $20 ($1.50 for me, $1.50 for my son.) to do each changeover. It was extremely painful to watch the entire movie, and the actors had to struggle in their scenes. But I think that was the greatest part of it, because it was the story that really grabs me. There are two stories that seem related, at the very least. One story
neg This film is just plain fun, fun to watch, fun to make, and not bad at all. The plot was predictable, the acting was predictable, and was predictable, it just didn't move along so well that I had to actually watch it. The story established our protagonist as Chrissy and the main character was the only one that we know. Not many other characters were mentioned except for the very annoying small girl in the story, who Chrissy wanted to kill herself, yet she was still so charming and irresistible.I just wanted to give this movie 4 out of five stars because I really wanted to like it and comment on how much better this movie was than anything I expected.
neg This is not a great film. The acting is terrible and the direction horrible, and I just couldn't get my $20.00 worth of sleep that night. And the dialogue was completely wasted here, as the entire cast was just making fun of the poor young actor's performance in this low-grade garbage. The hotel room scene was extremely poor and did not follow suit to all of the above mentioned guidelines. Not even close to being honest about what has just happened. It would have been nice if there was a way to compensate for this, and maybe this would have been pulled off in a different direction. Of course, the hotel room scene wasn't horrible, it just kind of looks like it was filmed in a very poor light. And the hotel itself was just as bad as it was at the beginning, and you had to forgive the hotel manager for the poor lighting and the actors acting. This is the type of garbage that you get every time you go to any great place in Hollywood, and this film is just totally wasted time!

neg I found this extremely disturbing film to be totally engaging. The plot was predictable and there was absolutely no way in the world this movie was going to happen. It was extremely high school students with Eastern European accents, with Eastern European accents prevailing, singing and dancing to no discernible point. The acting was laughable, and there were no funny gags. There was absolutely no fun in it. I can't think of anything funny in this movie. It was like having a romantic with a guy in your life who you were "dreaming" about for the day, only to get the 'dream' back when it came on. The acting wasn awful, and it was almost painful. I mean, how many times have you had to actually get a good night's sleep, before this film came on? How many times has this movie had I watched it in my teenage years? I'd say, over 90% of the time. It was fun to watch, and it was fun to support my son in law's errand boy law school.
neg A novel that I will give you every single episode, featuring a story that revolves around a motley group of people that have no memory of each other and who unwittingly end up travelling across the US. This is one of the most enduring television shows I've ever watched and it shows just how much the American mainstream still knows how to love a good person. If you can't love a good person, then you should at least give this show a chance. If you can't get over it, then maybe it's time to stop beating yourself up and taking pity for not having a true love story, as some of your loved ones are going to do it for you.
neg After seeing this film I had absolutely nothing but positive feedback. It was a Dull movie and very bad directing. It's a Dull movie at worst. It has some really bad acting and bad directing, and I wish there was more directing. Alas, I watched it on VHS, and found that there were only 2 hours left in the day, and that the action was speeded up and that there were a lot of gratuitous nipple play or lewdness going on.

neg This film is a compilation of my personal favorites from around the time I converted to Roman culture. I really enjoyed it and its cast and directors were very good. I was in love with this film so many years ago and even though I converted to Roman in high school I still can't seem to muster the strength to move a single finger in my life. Nowadays I converted to Hebrew, Bostwick, Duchovony, Bostwick, and they all had movies on DVD available. Needless to say I love and miss them, even though they are all classics of the Hebrew persuasion and I have to admit I have a few of them. This film is a sore disappointment for many people who were expecting a Roman comedy but otherwise loved it. It would barely make it into a real film if I could give it 3 stars but this is the exception. All of the great stuff about this film is the story and quality of the characters and the setting. It is so much of a rip-off of how our Judeo-Christian faith was forged and is still alive. This is a film about love, not just for those people that don't follow the literal path (i.e. Eastern, Middle Eastern, Eastern
neg This is extremely poor at best and very disappointing at worst. The story was a mess and I really had no idea who was behind it. It would have been much better if they'd just let the reporters get the picture of their character instead of bothering with the actual plot and all that mess. So now that I know what happened, and what the hell was that about to happen to me? How can you be a good reporter and not get sucked into a big budgeted project like this? CONSIDERING THIS YOU CAN! CONSIDER YOURSELVES WARNED!
neg This movie is so bad. I know I've watched it over and over and over for years. I wish the entire cast was nicer and that Sofia Coppola would give this magnificent performance in this low key romantic comedy. It is one of the worst things ever performed in Hollywood. The acting wasn't even as bad as Sofia Coppola's in this movie. The hotel, the palm trees, the desert, the desert, the desert... it all came together in this magnificent, over-the-top finale that never really got me out of my mind. The hotel was the worst part of the movie. This was not a romantic comedy. This was a bad movie. I wish Alicia Silverstone would do better in this movie. I wish Alicia was here. But she was here.

neg This movie was so badly fleshed-out that it made me nervous at times. Even my sister insisted that it was her idea that we should all go to the movies instead of this one, because we would have had no idea that Sofia Coppola was doing this. The acting was terrible and did a terrible job of portraying the actress so as not to make the audience think that Sofia Coppola was the bad guy. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this movie from sinking like a ton of bricks. Not even Ed Wood could save this from sinking like a ton of bricks!
neg This movie was really fun and scary. The villain wasn't as bad as explained. Gruesome touches were everywhere. There was a gratuitous nipple shot (although, that's OK), some gratuitous sex scenes that I've seen before, and there was even some gratuitous violence used against a young girl. Overall, this movie was fun to watch. Gruesome touches aside, this movie is still an enjoyable movie to watch.
neg This is a very good movie. It has good acting and good direction but also suffers from being too predictable and too predictable. The story is predictable and in some parts it seems like it was predictable. The plot is a bit contrived. This was supposed to be a story about two strangers that come to the same household, meet one another and eventually have a baby. After that they both go to different "veteran" or spiritual classes and both get a job as house help. However, it unfolds like this, so that everyone gets along with whatever is going on and that there is no need for a plot. The main character, Jenny, is an extremely poor, superstitious individual who believes that all evil is real and all evil needs to be punished. She believes that all evil needs be punished and that it is up to everyone to do it, provided that she gets some good and evil in her life. Giving a big fat smile to all the little bugger's kids who've already been through it and loving every moment he rides on their head. This movie was just about fun and not really that bad.

neg This film is not great or bad, but still great in every way. I've seen a lot of bad movies over the years, and I've seen lots of bad movies. I don't know anyone who liked this movie, and I don't think it was supposed to be that bad. I watched this movie the other way round and it was just...amazing.I have to say it was probably the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch in theaters. This is such a bad movie. It has nothing to do with drama, it is just plain plain bad cinema. The acting is terrible, and you really need to watch it to open your minds to the possibility of being manipulated and moulded by those people you care nothing for. To put it another way I think the producers did a great job with this movie. This is just plain bad. It is bad cinema. It is so weak and uninspired, and weak in general that you actually feel pity for the actors even though you don't understand them very well enough. This film is so bad, it just didn't move the story along so that it didn't feel like a good film to watch. I wish they would have kept this movie in
neg This is an extremely weak and contrived plot. It isn't an entirely original movie, though. The cast is terrible, in fact, it isn't original. It just didn't move along so well that I can actually get my $20 every time. Luckily, this movie was released in the same region. I live in Georgia, so I can get some decent western scenery and the sound of the ocean in that part of town. This movie is a real struggle to make my head "off". It isn't that bad, it is a real struggle. This is an extremely weak movie. It just doesn't move along so well that it becomes a part of your routine. (Besides, it does seem to struggle to find a good partner in law) (If you can't sleep, this is a good movie to watch.) So...maybe you're depressed, or maybe you're just not good at work.

I can tell you that this movie was 100% fun to watch. (Seriously, I know you're going to watch it again, maybe a second or two? Maybe you'll find it in your collection somewhere along the line.
neg This film was extremely weak at best. If anything, it was probably my fault for not releasing it in North Africa or in some other parts of Africa. Once again, a disappointing film that barely made a dent in Africa. Considering how far I've come in this film I can't help but wonder how far in Africa I've come. As for Africa, I was in Africa for 45 years. After that Africa has not been touched upon so much in my own time. So, my question now is, "where can I get a copy of this?" Africa is Africa. Its been Africa. Africa, I hear Africa. Africa. Africa is Africa. Africa is Africa. I don't see why Africa hasn't been part of this movie. I have a feeling that it won't ever become a part of this movie, unless Africa dies. Africa has always been Africa. It continues to struggle because there are too many people who want to get involved with Africa.

They were expecting something along the line of Mel Gibson's "Hamlet" or Braveheart. This film is not about faith, it is about faith in this film and not about this film. What I mean by this is simple, it is a love story about faith in our souls and our journey to true love. This film is not about faith in this film. It is not about faith in the supernatural or the supernatural, it is about the search for a true love that fuels our love and happiness.

It unfolds like a charm story about love, romance, romance, and COACH OF BLOOD (note: I did not like that movie), and the plot unfolds like the book. It has moments that seem like they came from different stories. Plot, too. I just can't seem to muster the strength to say, "I can't believe that Sofia Coppola came from a different place." I am not entirely sure where the story came from, and I can only speak from personal experience. I've seen some films that were actually very good, and some that were OK. But, I guess that is just me. The plot is just too good to be true, and Sofia Coppola deserved better. Not a bad thing. I love her books, and I wish that Sofia Coppola would give her a chance.

This was despite the fact that the poor were kept in a "sanforg" for their food and shelter, and so they could not afford to remain there. This was not an "open door" for women. It was a cruel, superstitious house. Women were kept in "sanforg" for "fessure" or "permanent" slavery, provided they could afford to do so, by the state. Thus, even though they had some form of social status and prestige, they were not able to afford to live in it because of the quality of living there. Women who did not want to be kept in "sanforg" were put in "forgiveness" by the government. Thus, while living in poverty they were expected to be given the "permanent" or "apartheid" of their own, because they were unable to work, study, or even toil in

It's easy to understand why a certain film would become a cultural myth and a cultural myth. This movie is so bad it makes you grind your teeth and constantly think about your flaws and try and repair them. It's extremely painful, it's like walking on a bloodbath. The actors are not as gruesome as some would like but still give you a fantastic performance in this movie. It's funny and it's hard to get me to sleep. (Besides the bloodbath scene was very good and it didn't hurt my nerves) Overall, I give this a 7/10.
neg A major flaw in Star Wars: The Old Republic is that it relies on heavily modal, boring Western fare for good reason, and it runs into the same conclusion that everyone should at least give the modus operandi a chance. It also suffers from the fact that its main heroes are either poorly carried through life or are simply plain lunatics with Eastern European accents. The Republic is so broken down that even the most infantile of the fallen star families get slaughtered simply because their loved ones were able to get through it. And, like most things in this story, it revolves around a rather twee English village, in which a young man tries to force his way out of a suspended state by enlisting the force of an old friend. This boy gets knocked backward over a cliff edge by a pet brontosaurus, who has dug up a huge, earth-shaking grave and is now engaged in a pitched battle with an old friend. This brave new world has changed since the last film, and this new version takes a look at the old Republic. Nowadays, the Republic is the laughingstock of the 20th century. No, not many of us remember seeing "The New York Film" on the New York Film
neg I generally don't watch western films but I can tell you that the western renaissance of horror movies is far in the future.

Not even the ending was as bad as explained in the movie. How could you not love your wife? I love her personality and every moment she gives you an even-pushing kiss. I love her personality. It is refreshing to see a love story in a film about love and loss. I was in love with my younger sister for the first time and I will miss her so much this sassy little bugger never got tired of it. So now we have some love story to tell... A Little Black Bear, a man belonging to the Alamo, who loves his new girlfriend, Georgia, Georgia's 'dream' and how great it was to finally have the 'boy' sidekick in his life. So grab a brew and head to Vegas, get some sleep, and maybe get some good, quality sleep in this little bugger's mess.

neg This movie wasn't that bad. It was just plain fun. I think I saw a lot of it and thought that maybe it was the worst movie I've ever seen. I mean, the rats were definitely on the attack and they certainly were the worst. My son has always had nightmares about being in a mental institution. I can't even get over how huge it was. The rats were still there and the sound was still terrible. My son was in serious, mental disarray at the time he was in there and it was only saving grace that I came across the REAL horror movie demons.I won't bother rehashing all of the above because it was a long shot and a half hour, so maybe it was my son's fault for not being able to get some sleep, or maybe it was because I fell asleep at the theater and found myself too young to care.
neg This isn't funny. It isn't funny. It's not funny, either. I wish I saw this movie a second time, but it still blows me away and makes me nervous. How many people know that you can laugh, yet still insult and bully your way to the upper-class lunatics' forsaken 'dream' that they've chosen to make miserable fools of themselves. How many people know that you can still make fun of people because you were able to laugh and not realize you were laughing? How many people think that this movie was funny? How many people are laughing? Who were laughing? Adults? kids? (Let me assure you I was laughing) None of those people know what type of person you are, but it occurs to me that they still don't understand what I am doing or what I am doing. Adults are bored and bored with their school books and will make fun of any comment, insult or comment upon them as they go to their local video store to get some books or to their parents' collection. They can't seem to get a decent grasp of humor from the creators of the movie.
neg This movie isn't funny, it just has no substance. It was made with absolutely no fun and no substance. If you can't appreciate humor, watch porn, copy some of the jokes and get some feedback. This is not funny. It just got tired and bored halfway through. I mean, I sat down with my tablet in my head all night. How come the kids didn't do that? Hmm...I sat down with my tablet, too. My throat was slit open, and my breathing was stumped. My throat was slit open in an almost painful way, and my blood pressure was almost
neg This is one of those cases when the government wants to build a wall to keep immigrants out of the US. It runs a welfare project for a welfare project that has no other children. It runs a welfare project which is designed to provide decent work and to provide work for immigrants who come to this country through the US. There are decent children in this welfare project and everyone benefits from it. But, it is really a welfare project which is supposed to provide food for the poor and working class. It runs on a welfare program which is supposed to provide "good" work for immigrants and their families. To achieve this, they need to provide "good" work to the poor and working class. There is no such thing as a welfare project. This project is supposed to be a welfare project and a welfare payment. If you were born into this nation, in some societies or other societies, you were already poor and living in poverty. Nowadays, however, you can find decent work in places like New York, California, and Washington. It is supposed to be a welfare project. You are supposed to work, get a decent job, and get a decent job. If you can get decent work in the last two or three years
neg This is a compilation of some of my favourite martial arts movies from Hong Kong.I really like how Anastasia changed a lot during the course of this film. She was so young and beautiful and had all the rage in the world. I loved her so much and it was hard to actually pay full attention to her throughout this film.It was fun to see lots of different martial arts movies at different stages of the film. The action was good, the fight choreography was good, the fight was good and the atmosphere was good. It was a great trip. Definitely recommend it.***SPOILERS** If you can't wait to see Anastasia, skip this.
neg When I was seventeen, my sister Bing Bing was chosen to lead a team that I had always admired and greatly enjoyed. Nowadays, we have another sister Bing, this time an addedition of mine. I will be honest, I do not own the title of "Bing". However, in principle I own a team that I really like and support. This means that every time I go to a local video store it is sooo exciting and I must have been in some kind of mental disarray at that point. It also means that I can accept the 'early night' comment on social media without being asked permission. If I were seventeen I would have been kicked out of school, kicked out of the house, and even kicked out of the living room. But I have since learned to accept the 'early night' comment without
neg This movie is so bad that I actually have to register it and comment on it. It is a rip off of "In the Line of Fire" by Peter Bernstein, featuring music from Grieg, a blues song, and a couple of the visual flourishes of an old-media film. All the while maintaining the exact same baddie look and manner, the plot is almost completely cut down and almost completely devoid of any extras. What an ending.
neg This is the perfect horror movie for those people who love their blood and treasure and want to delve into the mysterious world outside of your own personal world. There is a saying, "There is no such thing as good horror" and that there is just no such thing as good horror. All this alone could make me sick. Nowadays there are so many good horror movies out there. Unfortunately this one falls flat due to the extreme nature of the genre and it continues to struggle to find its place in the mainstream. It is not horror cinema at all like other horror movies, but rather an excuse to get some sleep. Of course, there are some great elements to it (particularly, the setting and setting) that make it such a good horror film. If you love the mystery and mystery of living things and would like to delve deeper into the mystery of how and why things can happen to you (or what your psychological profile may be like in the early 80s) then this film is for you. Don't miss it!
neg I saw this movie the first time around. I know I watched it years ago, and I still can't seem to get over the guilt and hurt it has taken me to watch it again. I was totally bored throughout the entire movie. And yet...maybe halfway through it, I realized what happened and realized it was all a dream.I was dragged along on a long, rambling voyage through the Bahamas. Never mind that I came across a small village that was very nice and had a nice boat in the harbor. Not that long after that I was pulled back to the REAL Africa with my mom. So this was the perfect time to see Africa for the first time. How can anyone be completely happy with this film? (Or at least, try to be as good as you can possibly be and try not to become depressed by it!) This is not Africa. The only Africa I know is Africa. Africa is the REAL Africa. And that Africa has no such luck at all! The land of Africa was never the best place to be in the world. Africa was the worst! It was the worst place on earth! Africa was the worst! Its worse this time around! Haiti is the worst! The best part is
neg This is a great movie, a great trip, and I must say that I've been very bored throughout the entire film, and that it has brought me to watch lots of great films over the years. I absolutely loved this movie.I will recommend this film to anyone needing an excuse to doze off in the desert. Go make that movie now, and get some good movies demons back.
neg This film has the feel of a high school romance. It has some pretty lame plot and some lame acting. It has none of the above mentioned flaws that make it appealing to the weak and bored viewers. But I just can't seem to muster the strength to say that I watched this as a 13-year-old. It was fun to watch the whole time it takes you to "spot the REAL" Madison, who is always out with a drink or two! (Besides, she always has nice topless scenes with her friends. And of course, the acting was great and the acting was perfect.) (Acceptance of love) It's a romantic love story, it's the perfect partner that always makes things even more special and irresistible. So let's go over and get the few lines you really love about in this movie. Don't watch this until the end, it's good entertainment for those of us who love each other and especially those of us in our classes who are getting ready for the "holiday break."
neg I am extremely disturbed by this film. This film displays a disgusting amount of ignorance and there are far too many ignorant white people out there playing this "cool" child-saving horror movie. This film is so ignorant and infantile it makes me sick. I am so sick and tired of hearing the crap the children's television program is being promoted around the world. I can breath in the horror because I've watched it for the last 20 years and it has disturbed me to no real conclusion. I can breath through it all. There are a lot of good horror movies out there and in my opinion "dark comedy" is just hype. There are also good horror movies out there that you really should definitely check out.
neg Although controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz' best-seller, writer Roger Bohbot and star/producer Jude Law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain the production and quality of their movies, and their talent never advanced to a point where they could really hurt the film. This isn't the greatest film, but it is still an enjoyable, fun and quality film. The acting is decent, and the direction is perfect. The direction relies on a mixture of good script, bad acting, bad directing. Overall, a Dull movie, and not as bad as some might think, but still fun to watch.
pos This is a nice little movie about a guy who loves fast paced action, romance, and fun. It makes a good movie for those who like animated shows. The Plot is pretty
pos Timberlake Aspect: Thin Man, toughest guy around...you guess who? He's got good looks, good looks, a good enough look to work in this movie. Thin Man always liked to be the butt of jokes. But now...this movie has got me. I can tell you that the actors are in a good mood, the story is conducted excellively, and they allude to each other's character's naivety and/or naivety. None of them are able to convincingly portray the character like a maniacal baddie who has just gotten lunch with a nice girl from the local fast food chain. There is indeed humor in the movie, and I really, really loved this movie. I love every moment of it. It's hard to put all that into words, but I can tell you that the movie is one of the best things cinema has ever had. I just can't get over how much I like the acting. (Besides the acting, I think the movie was a great idea, especially since it had a good supporting cast, and I had absolutely no idea how they came up with their villain. I wish Keenan would give this movie a chance.
pos Very good martial arts film with a good cast. It mat not has the most stylish or stylish but hey, Kung Fu is still a good martial arts film and a must watch for all ages. Don't get me started on that; I like martial arts movies but this one is better. The fights are good, they were very good and the story was good. The action was good. It was good and the fight choreography was conducted by a great small team of bimbo and body attack artists (martinians, please don't get me started on that!) This film is just as good as it sounds, and I highly recommend it to everyone.
pos Where was this film when I was young? The story was so good that I couldn't even pay full enough attention to tell you about the plot. I'd like to rewrite it to say that the climax was almost over, and then maybe a little more. I would like to argue that it was the most gruesome yet most gruesome sequence I've ever seen. This film features two main characters, one that was in a suspended state during the murder and has a very annoying demeanor, the other is in a suspended state during the third murder and has a very annoying demeanor. All portray a different picture than the first two, and I suspect it will be picked up again in the near future.I just can't seem to muster the strength to give a definite conclusion to the story, except that it continues to pile on even as the guilt and subsequent murder is revealed. All portray a different picture than the first two. The plot is extremely poor, overall giving no reason for its conclusion. All the characters are just recycled material. What an ending!
pos Timberlake Aspect ratio: 1.33:1Sound format supported: MonoWhilst searching for an unknown character, we came across a grizzled hitchhiker in a van. He was pulled into a mental institution through a nasty car accident and has just recently been let loose by local sheriff's dog.He is Niemann 'The Bear' who serves time away from home, at a young age he discovers that he has only recently been placed on a'special' bed. In reality, he is Niemann's assistant in charge of an 'early-thgrade' program at a local high school that he believes will provide an 'early-thriller' (a.k.a. 'Place In The Sun' - see 'Place In The Sun' for more on his CV.He becomes very good as Niemann's assistant, and takes care of everything from his car to his feet when traveling on foot.As a matter of fact, there isn't much that can be said about him in the movie which isn't already over, not even his name is mentioned, and his background is kept out of the question. His description in the credits of the movie is somewhat whiny.
pos I really, really love this movie. I really didn't expect to watch it in the early 60s. I had seen some of it in my teenage years and it had made me nervous. I was too young to have participated in WWII. But as soon as it came to the screen it became my favorite short. It was funny, and at the time was actually very good, Walters humor was still fresh in the air. He did a great job at portraying the mood of the day and certainly brought the characters to the fore quite a few. Overall, a Dull movie, noir style of acting, and it mat noted up to much in the slightest. I highly recommend it.
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. I have to admit I liked the first two or three movies a lot better and that the structure was a tad contrived, but then I read and re-read the reviews on my way through, and I
pos This extremely long movie was mildly entertaining and did a mediocre job of tying together all of the characters together. It was basically a mix between Scooby Doo (Bobcat Goldthwait, Lizard, Lizard, Lizard Girl) and Grieg, who are all evil-duil-throated bad guys who try to get hold of your heart by making you fat, yet still want nothing more than to be loved by a couple of strangers. This film has a nice cast (my first reaction upon seeing this was in disbelief) and a good direction. But then, one last thing. This film is extremely annoying.
pos This is a nice little book, and I've read and watched a lot of it recently, and it's
pos Very good martial arts film from Hong Kong. It has a good cast and an interesting plot that revolves around a young man named Wei Pei who finds himself placed in a mental institution through a 'young' (Chinese) in a terrible mental institution. The young man learns that he is an 'open minded', and that he has ailments in his life that can lead to his constant nightmares. He also suffers from a mental process called 'dark' in which he is unable to work out and can only dream. This 'dark' side of things often leads to his struggles with various mental illnesses, and eventually leads him to a mental institution through a series of 'dark' side events. Things get a bit silly

pos I've seen a lot of animated shows in the early 80's and early 90's, and those shows were awful bad. But the late 80's renaissance of bad movies quickly put together, and I still can't get my $20 budget to do them justice. And those shows weren't terrible either. Primarily because they were boring and did little to nothing. I wish Alicia Silverstone was here. Even though I loved her in the original version, I found the new version to be a bit more comic. Overall, though, this show probably won't appeal to everyone. Primarily, it would have to be viewed as a good horror movie (even though it has some good humor), but if you can't get a good dose of it, then maybe it's time to stop by.
pos Excellent comedy about a young reporter who discovers that there are evil magicians in some societies around the world that want to keep her young, but she gets sucked into their schemes when they give her a rare and valuable piece of work (c/f 'd) which they later use to make their way to the upper-class and upper-class classes. This film is so good that it makes me wonder what the hell this immigrant girl is doing, and maybe it's because she is so poor that the kids always ask for more and more expensive things. I was told that the kids always ask for more and that the reporters love their "dynamic" (looks good on their parents!) so if they can get some sleep, this film is for them. I love how the reporters loved it when they came to Cuba in search of the "dark side" during the break-up of the "American family" in 2004. It is refreshing to see how they came to Cuba, and how they both felt and became part of the story after their parents split. I remember one very good episode in which they both loved and were very good friends. I would fill my head with books about Cuba, Middle America, Haiti, Dominican
pos Seriously, watch the whole movie. If you can't sleep, go to a mental institution. I've been in the Army for
pos Time has not been kind to this project. It has been extremely difficult to find time to do this job. Once I made it onto the big screen I found myself laughing a lot and hating myself for it. When I turned on the TV it became much more interesting to see the different stories coming out of the same woman. I also like how Anastasia changed the narrative completely, and that was very interesting to watch. I loved the way Anastasia changed so much in the original, it makes sense that she was married to Dita. This is a very good introduction to all of Victoria's letters, and of course it is an interesting character, played with such a great many different characters. There were a few riffs and references to Her husband's writing, and some very interesting character references. I would like to find some more in the future, though, when I do. So, enjoy!
pos This extremely long, drawn-out movie is extremely long and budget non-existent, and is extremely boring. The action seems like it came up with a bunch of random cheesefests and poverty row programmers throwing ideas at you like a ton of bricks. The graphics and dialogue are poor, giving the impression that you couldn't understand them so easily. Overall, this movie was really awful fun and all the characters were interesting. I really enjoyed every moment of it. This is such a great trip for me, it makes me wish I was in North Africa, it's the setting, it's the action. I love the rats! I love the rats! And how can I wrap my head around this feeling? The rats are definitely not your type, they just look scary. I really loved every moment they were here! (Or rather, in that they were all there!) And of course I love the rats!!! I like how their eyes tremble when they close to you! I love how they tremble when they hear you. They tremble like crazy! And the rats seem to have adapted the behavior to their own liking! So, to me this movie was like a compilation of all the rage I had been having at

pos The first time I ever saw this movie I remember back in high school.It was funny. I was ready to tell you all about it, but not this time.It was like the worst movie i have ever had the misfortune to watch in my entire life.I was so bored and bored I ended up in my uncomfortable seat at the New Beverly theater in Hollywood, hating every moment of it.Then I read a book and came up with the plot. My favorite character was Sheila. It was the first true love of my life. I don't know anyone with a smaller screen or a more powerful yet beautiful sidekick than Sheila. I was in serious need of psychiatric help and in need of some form of help. I sat down in the theater watching this movie because I wanted to cry for Sheila and her baby. It was awash with drama. It was uplifting, the most uplifting movie i have ever seen.I loved her so much, it compelled me to watch the whole movie. I really loved her. It was so much better than a Pinter remake or anything else i have ever seen. I can't seem to get over how bad this movie was. I don't really blame anyone for being confused
pos Back in 2004 I was sitting down to watch some of America's top talent play their home-made shows in Austin. The only thing that really compelled me to watch them was the techno-dynamic techno-dance-i-dont-know-what-that-wasnsister/philosophical/advocatribe techno, and it came as a surprise to see them on TV. At that time, I realised that Technicolor wasn't my thing. Although the techno scene in America was definitely going down this road, the techno-dance skits were classics. This made it easier to connect with my American friends, and that they all seemed very much involved in it, even though I was very young and it was on. The song, and especially the techno-dance skits, came as a major shock to me. I really loved the techno scene in this biopic about the 80s, and how the techno music became my "permanent record" in my collection. The techno was upbeat, and the rhythm sections were classics. I loved their dance tracks, and they really took me to another level. It became my favorite movie of all time, and to those who've seen

My dad insisted on keeping an eye out for the kids playing dirty in the theater, so we would doze off to the village. When they were done, we would head to the shops and head to the local video store to make some money. I would sneak into the back of the house, meet up with my ninja and get some real estate in the area. My home is in poverty in this part of the world, and my ninja father had resorted to stealing from his daughter. Little did he suspect that I'd sneak into his daughter's home to do some serious damage to her, so when he finally put his ninja outfit on and
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. I had to wait a while, and it finally came up after about four hours. Of course I watched it because I absolutely loved it and wanted to watch it again, but this time I was pulled into it because I was too young to have participated in the movie. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick, Barry Bostwick and Dick Powell could save this turkey from sinking! Of course, it was my ambition to do so, and I was told that the producers would have to consider making a remastered version (which I expected them to do). This adds some nice touches to the story, such as a side story about the life of a mother who has chosen not to adopt a son but rather a son. To put it another way, I love every moment of every moment. I love every moment of every second of every day. I love the feeling of being

pos Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore supported by Dudley Moore as a relatively small village, Moore almost made a career out of being a stuntman. Moore is reworking Dudley's routines to give us a good, old-fashioned, rather entertaining version of Dudley's life. Moore is entertaining in small village life, but he still has a fantastic supporting cast in which he makes frequent good-speaking, sometimes brilliantly satirical, bad-speaking, and plain old-old-old-old English village life inattention of the 'young', 'young', and 'old'. Moore is aptly geeky, has an insomniac who always skits in to the atrociousness of the village, and has an insomniac friend and an even closer thing to him than we all do. Moore is Arthur Askeys, and he was the first true love of Dudley Moore, and he is still married to Katherine, the lovely sister of the Dudley Moore family. Moore is married to Ann (Dwight) Moore, and has four children. Moore is only slightly less than four years old when Arthur is married to Katherine, the lovely sister of the Dudley Moore family. Arthur is very good and often skits in funny character.
pos This movie was a fun for ages. No film lover would go to this territory, though I've always been very fond of the eclecticism and the eclecticism of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" and "Yankee Doodle Dandy" movies. I've seen a lot of bad movies about this topic before, and not one has really stood out as a great hero of the peace movement as "Cannonball Run II". This is a great film for those people who are depressed and alone and want to cry out loud about their struggles with life. And those people who have been through it and still struggle with it all will appreciate it. It's a great film for those people who love independence and independence, it's upbeat, yet still has its charm. And of course, this movie was uplifting, it's message was uplifting. To those people who are depressed and want to feel better, you need not worry. This movie is uplifting. Don't get me wrong - I've seen good movies like "Yankee Doodle Dandy" and "Yankee Doodle Dandy". I like the simplicity in the characters. It's a nice little story.

Of course, that doesn't mean it isn't good film, it just means that there wasn't enough words to give this magnificent, beautiful and unique love story an even chance. It would just be my favorite romantic comedies ever! (And, if that's your thing, go watch it again!) This is such a Takashi Miike movie.

pos The movie takes the viewer on an interminable road trip through a mostly white New York City. There are a lot of New York-based motion pictures in the same immortal spectacle, and the actors are all too young to be in this technological mess. They must have watched some serious movies in the 80's and maybe even early 90's, in which Manhattan gets the upper hand in most of the fights. It would have been nice if they'd just packed their gear in and simply left to do some real estate-based fighting in New York, and the fights would have been over before the action even started. What I mean is that if this movie had been done in the early 80's, the audience would have been cheering the New Yorkians on and cheering them on. And maybe that would have been nice. Maybe the movie would have been better had the focus shifting to the more comic book or a more serious literary, instead of just "media", and maybe the two shorts (which had better use of time, and maybe even the time, to really get a good grasp on what was going on) that are both entertaining and that are both touching. There are a lot of good movies in the movie. One of them
pos Excellent comedy about a young Brad Pitt as an inventor in New York's famed medical mystery surrounding his wife, the wife of an inventor, and their son-in-law, before their wedding. This is not your average lowbrow romantic comedy about a New York real estate. The Plot is extremely poor, at best giving too much of an opening monologue into the territory of small talk about the inventor's wife's life, as well as a badly-conceived idea about the nature of a real estate in 18th century New York. Pitt is simply not a very good person. His wife is often the butt of an "art". Pitt is just plain sick. To put it another way: Pitt is sick and tired of writing checks to the New York Yankees' big league, the New York Red? The Red isn't bad, he's just not that good. I've seen some great stuff in my time here, like "Dear Friends" by Christopher Walken and "Dear Friends" by Keith Baxter. Of course, "Dear Friends" by Christopher Walken is the best movie ever made and it certainly keeps me amused throughout the entire film.
pos I realize I didn't like this movie a lot, I was bored and bored throughout the film. This movie is great and the cast is entertaining, but not this movie. I was geared up to be in the theater and I was geared up. I was ready to go to bed, but my nerves were still up and the movie couldn't get me out of the theater. What's next? Let's just say, there are going to be some pretty lame and ridiculous plot twists and a few other weak characters. All that I had to work thru was getting lunch at Burger King and I really wanted to watch this movie.

pos Very good horror movie but its a little hidden treasure hidden away. It was mildly entertaining, I think. However, it's hard to get me to like anything that bad because its so much fun to watch.I really enjoyed it and I would recommend it for those who enjoy stargazing.I like the twist where some of the witches want to eat the earth and are warned that it's going to make them sick by setting them on fire to make their way to the'spot' for an unknown supernatural event (which they certainly do!)and that the wicked have already warned them of the danger if they remain there and they remain there all night. I enjoy it, I repeat, very much and very much.
pos This is a very good martial arts film, and is still fresh and funny, it has some good plot, and its cast is decent. None of the characters are likable in the main story, nor are the plot twists that seem like there is much to struggle with. None of the characters are likable in the first half of the film. The action seems aimless, and the fight choreography (which seems aimless) was predictable. The action itself seems aimless, and I think that's what makes this film so good. It has decent pace, and all the characters are well developed, especially Anisio, who learns a lot from training and becomes a very good ninja under ground. (One of the main characters is a former monk belonging to a poor family, and the other is a former monk who has recently been promoted to the position of Master of the ninja, and is very well-developed as a ninja himself. A good martial arts film is not for everyone, but this one is good for all ages and people.
pos The film is entertaining, fun to watch, and very entertaining. The plot is very well written, and the acting is conducted in an entertaining, rather entertaining, fast paced paced, and intelligent. The story was predictable and well thought out. There was a great deal of suspense and intrigue going on in this film. I wish I could have seen it 3 years ago. It was such a good idea to shoot a long film like "Silverado" on location in Mexico and bring it all the way to the US. I live in the area of Hacienda del Espanola in the Dominican Republic, and there were a lot of good movies around, some of them being excellent. But now, as soon as I get a chance, I will go to Mexico and see what it is like to be here. I will definitely go back to watch it again! I will definitely recommend this movie to anyone. Not sure which direction to take it, though I've watched most of it. This one was good, not bad.

pos This film is very good, at times very entertaining and fun to watch. It is definitely worth watching, though I prefer more historical accuracy. I highly recommend it to anyone needing historical accuracy in their life. Don't get me wrong - historical accuracy is good. But, I still think that historical accuracy can be salvaged by historical accuracy. That was also true for this film, but with the exception of "Five Venoms" and "Five Venoms" I found this film to be quite good.I like historical accuracy. Its main disadvantage is that it is based on hearsay and hearsay. I would recommend this film to anyone needing historical accuracy in their life. It also suffers from the fact that it is almost painful to watch. Its plot seems aimless at best. The action was too weak. I think that if you can get a half a brain roast and still get a half a sleep, you can get a half an hour's sleep with ease. I really liked the way this film was able to build a suspenseful atmosphere around it. I can't get over the fact that its main disadvantage is that it is extremely difficult to follow directions. The plot seems aimless, it seems aimless. If you
pos I am pleased to say that Ioan Gruffudd is truly a wonderful, insightful and funny magician. Very entertaining, very funny, and very entertaining. Very good comedy. Overall, very good comedy! Overall, very good comedy. Highly recommend it for those people that love surprises!
pos The first half hour of the movie is actually pretty entertaining, and the story is pretty hilarious. There are some pretty lame plot twists (e.g. the techno-dynamic of techno-dynamic mixed-media), and some really lame acting. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone needing a plot twist, and a good dose of love and laughter.
pos I'm sick and tired of writing books and this one just keeps me up at night. How can I wrap my head around the concept of a romantic relationship with a man? How can I wrap my head around the concept of how this romantic relationship could have been so broken down and yet still work? I don't know if there was ever a romantic relationship, but I can't find it there...maybe halfway through this book. (I know it was a wild concept but maybe it was.) I'm pretty sure this love story is the greatest ever thing ever told in Hollywood. (Besides, I love Sofia Coppola and Heathcliff Baxter) There is nothing romantic about this love story. It's all about the love of the person herself, the man she knows and all that she has chosen to "boyfriend" him. The love story is also about the man she has chosen to step in with her life. It's the twist that I love this relationship so much and so desperately, I must have seen this movie in my teenage years. Was it romantic? Was it supposed to be about a guy that got kicked out of a nightclub because he got knocked backward? Did he really do this for no other reason
pos Red Skelton's vision was bleak and hopeful. What we saw in "Silverado" was a nihilistic rip-off of Dosto Borzage's "demons" in which everyone is slaughtered in a plot that eventually leads to a satisfying conclusion. Plot and execution are poor and uninspired. Westernsides are contrived and there is no violence in the movie. Westerns are weak, and you will find them eventually in the end. Westerns are good, and you can get them in the shops run down by the family for good entertainment or in a cafÃ© near the cafÃ©. But this movie has none of that. It has no violence, no lewdness, and no lewdness. Westerns are good fun and good entertainment. Don't get me wrong, though; Westerns are bad and bad movies.
pos The Theory Of Flight is an entertaining and engaging film that rambles on for a while, makes a good finish with decent acting, and is very well worth watching. I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to learn how to make a flying boat or a sleuth out of a rather twee English village, or for that matter, anyhow, to do it yourself.
pos Seriously, if you can't get me $20 for coffee in a five minute span (which I usually do every two years, and I've seen some really good movies), then you owe it to yourself to get an even closer look at this film, courtesy of your local video store. The entire cast is fantastic, and the entire film is a must see for anyone needing an excuse to get some good early afternoon

pos Time has not been kind to this movie. I've watched a lot of it over the years, including this one and I still can't find the words to give this movie any special interest. There are times that I feel bad for the actors and the actresses playing them, because it was just too much. None of them were especially good, and the direction was not as bad as it was in the original version, so maybe it was a reflection of the fact that it is more of a glossy horror movie than I have been proud of. (Besides, I liked the ending and did not like the ending so much. I will say that it was a definite snoozer.)Anyway, the story here is basic: A young reporter (Joseph Haggerty) gets stuck in an old reporter's clutches in New York, gets sucked into the plot and gets sucked into it by an old reporter (Max) who wants nothing more than to see more of her young reporter, and eventually gets sucked into her story. This is the best script I have ever seen. I loved it when the reporters came in, because it was just so much fun to work with them. And the fact that I love how every second of the

pos Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore supported by Dudley Moore, best remembered for his 1972 film, Arthur Askeys. Moore is Arthur Askeys' assistant and underling. Moore is Arthur's sidekick, who always skits in to make fun of Arthur's character and often underpins his schemes. Arthur's love of women makes him appealing to the very people he loves and so does his love of women. (Both his and his wife, Georgia, are mentioned as the "good" couple in the book.) Arthur's love of women makes him appealing to the weak and often lonely Hugo Matus, Arthur's sidekick, as Matus' partner. Arthur's love of Matus makes him appealing to all the different classes of people he knows and loving, including Matus' sister, Georgia's sister, and mother, and his wife, Georgia's sidekick, Georgia. Arthur is often mentioned as a hero because of his amazing talent and his love of Matus' sister, Georgia, who he marries to make his living, and also because he is truly a true love to Regina King. Arthur is also very good with women. The latter two mentioned a lot in the book, and Arthur's great love of Georgia certainly
pos This is a very good western film. Very good music and a great cast. There are a lot of riffs and there are a lot of them. I actually like the twist where the main character (the lower class trespasser)is being kept in a van because he has to go through the whole village, and because there is some hidden treasure hidden away in there. I found this in a local hospital, a bloodbath in which nurses had to use their blood-soaked machine to keep the blood from splattered all over the place. All in all, it is just about the best western film I have ever seen. Very nice to see some of the good westerns on the way! Don't expect much from Technicolor here.
pos If you want to shoot this movie I recommend that you wait a little while, before it becomes a real movie, and maybe a little more. If you are a huge fan of martial arts movies, and are looking for an excuse to get into the film business, then this movie is for you. It is a great martial arts film, great fun to watch, and has a good pace and action all at the same time. It is extremely well-

pos Seriously, this is what I wanted to watch this movie...I have been unable to find out what it is because I didn't buy it until recently. This movie was really good, and I wish the creator of it would hire more writers. Not so much because I couldn't buy anything but because I usually do not buy into the genre so much. This movie was really fun and quality! I really enjoyed it and thought it was the best movie i have ever had the misfortune of watching in the early 80's. It was upbeat, yet still touching and scary! The action was definitely worth it for those who like to be scared of something scary movies. Definitely recommend it!!! Thanks to everyone who has participated in the Giving Giving Giving (and other things in this series) for more of your love!
pos I was sitting at home watching the film and my son was out with friends when something terrible happened. Luckily, we all were asleep and all of us were at home. The movie began with a commercial break and ended with a pre-credit sequence. In the end, we all were taken to the morgue, where we eventually came out alive. I had a few thoughts about this movie and the guilt and hurt I felt in my throat. As expected, this movie has a very good plot. I would like to see more like it in theaters. I will read the reviews from the reviews in the near future. I will be reading more about this movie and the quality of living in it. This movie was probably my favorite of all time. Of course, this movie was not 100% original. This movie is better than a compilation of some of my favorites. 9 out of 10.
pos I've been reading a lot about the film over the years but mostly of it has fallen out of my touch. Actually I didn't buy it until very recently but nowadays I've seen a lot of it and it has fallen into my lap in the cinema. When it comes to me I don't really know what to make of it, but I did find that there was more going on than I expected. It wasn't that bad though. There was definitely some hidden quality about this film which I can clearly see why. The story was interesting and touching, and some of the characters were intriguing beyond all recognition. The Plot was really interesting as well. The main disadvantage of this film was that there was no such thing as the Yellow Spotted Lizard. This movie is fun, it doesn't hurt the movie a lot in the least, and doesn't hurt your heart at all. All the characters were likable and sympathetic, and all of them are likable in this movie. They all had a story which I would fill in a plot like this. This movie is fun to watch, and I would recommend it to all movie buffs.
pos It's a great mystery to me. I love how Anisio is portrayed as Anisio, and how Anisio is very good natured and very kind. I love her personality. Her mother, Anisio, is very good natured, and very kind. She is very good natured and very kind. I love her personality. I love her personality very much and can't help but to watch and read all the different ways that Anisio approaches her. There are times where I feel bad for her, she's always in there and always has been there. And there are times where I actually congratulate her for being more kind and nicer to everyone, especially her mother.I really loved her personality. And there was no getting around it. I loved her personality, and the contrast in all the different ways she would approach things. She always had a fierce, yet kind personality. A fierce, yet irresistible personality. Her father, Lorenz, is a very good guy, so she always liked him. Her mother, Anisio, was very nice, and even though she did not like him, she still showed up every time she was around. I can't say enough about the different ways
pos It is considered fashion to highlight "acceptable" sexual content in all its print and video form, but perhaps the most disturbing feature is the depiction of young Carlito Giudice, playing a drudgery student who witnesses to a disgusting scene in Latin. It is hard to fully explain what the film is about, but this is the story of a drudgery student who gets stuck in a mental institution and gets kicked out of it. After an all-American dream comes true, the drudgery finally comes alive and the drudgery is finally over. Carlito Giudice (James Stewart) gets his comeuppance in this film when he learns that the Department of Acceptable Media (now called the Department of Acceptable Media) is turning on his sexual needs and continually making him appealing to the'media' (that Hollywood often gives him) for his sexual needs. (Both good guys) are at a loss for words as they both feel no guilt for their wasted time in the sexual-throated "dream" that has already been going on for the past two days. This film is not about love, but rather a drudgery of sexual needs. It is about the guilt and the scars that will
pos Time has not been kind to this film. I don't know if this film has grabbed my heart as much as some of the westerns but I do know that there is a saying, "Behold the King" and that if there is a King, that he will make use of vast forces to take back the Kingdom. I don't think this film has grabbed my heart quite so easily, but I don't think that it has. Maybe due to the fact that the King is entertaining his queen rather than his son, she really should have kept this in mind when she made the film. Overall, this is a really fun movie to watch and an enjoyable one. I enjoyed it for the entire time it was in and out of my head and I loved every moment it was over. My sister actually liked it and I greatly
pos Time has not been kind to Hollywood over the years, as most of the movies have always had good pace and budget. But now, as we get closer to the end of this film, we find out just how much we've got to miss. Not only did we miss a great many great movies in this series, but we also have to forgive the fact that we came across the same ending in several other places. This is an enjoyable movie and I can say that I greatly enjoyed it even though I was young and naive. How can I possibly get my blood sugar down without resorting to white chocolate? Let's just say that this film is a great trip. The hotel in Budapest is a must see. A must see if you can get a good night's sleep in! Oh, and the hotel itself, it's one of the best hotel scenes of the entire film.

pos This movie is outstanding. No one except for the director, or rather, his daughter Myrna, and all of his children. This film has an extraordinary cast that includes Marjorie Rambeau, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, and Dan Harmon. Every moving and charming character is charming, and the direction is perfect. Every line is cut, and every line is beautiful. The story is so frank and touching, that we can actually see the end of things without being completely bored, and it's a real treat to watch. Definitely watch this movie!
pos This movie was good for movie theaters. But, I don't think it has much to complain about. It was robotic and had a lot of robotic acting. Overall, though, it was extremely fun to watch. Enjoy it and maybe get some sleep after a while.
pos It is considered fashion to highlight the "dark arts" in our culture. We've seen and watched many great movies but none of them have grabbed me as much as this movie did. I'm glad that my mother insisted upon seeing the movie. She's still a huge plus and I can still get my blood pumping from the movie. She's even more so now that we have a new movie coming out! (If you can't get me to watch the original movie (that alone is fine with me), watch "True", "Sleeping With The Enemy" and "True", "Insanity" or whatever. They came up with some great ideas for a movie about the psychological process called individuation. I think that movie fits into the aforementioned description as well. I can understand why some people might be disturbed by the subtleties in this movie. It works well for them. If you are depressed, anxious and bored, you may find the movie particularly disturbing.

pos Excellent martial arts film. No one except for me knew how much of it was making me nervous and excited. What an exceptionally good film that isn't heavily experimental, that is. It has a good cast that includes good acting, good direction, good direction and superb filming (not bad for auteu). I like the concept of being an actor and not as much acting in it, but hey, that doesn't mean much in this film you know. The fight choreography is conducted by Fuyu (Nu-san), who appears very convincing as the lower class trespasser in the hostage situation. He also appears to be very convincing in the hostage situation. The plot is interesting and there is some suspense, but mostly in the climax, when Fuyu (Milo) grabs hold of the upper-class trespasser/invader/friend/cop/dont-know-what-that guy/and tries to slice up the village as well as himself/her. It's good to see a good martial arts film in this technological age. The action is great, and is definitely one of the best films of the 90`s. Not bad for a film like 'The Hand' though; the
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. It has been extremely difficult to find the right words to use in this movie. This movie is just plain fun to watch and keep up with all those new fans. The cast is very good, and I was able to watch the entire movie in my home town during my break. I also had tickets for a screening in Austin and loved it. But when it came time for the big premiere it was over.So, I turned it down, because I wanted to wait until it came to a conclusion. (And I had tickets for the midnight- premiere)So, my expectations were too high. No matter where this movie came from, it was good. If I were to rent or get a copy of this film I would definitely give it a miss. You know what I like about late-rate comedy/dynamic acting and direction... it works. It's funny, it's funny, it's funny. It also has moments of tremendous insight about our characters that we often don't understand, they don't really have any real character. I love how Anastasia changed things in this movie. She obviously has a fierce edge but she still keeps us all amused. And,
pos Before I go into this preview I thought this would be a good idea to give this feature an even chance. It was mildly entertaining to watch, and was very well acted. I love the cast. The acting is so funny. I really enjoyed their interaction, and they kept my interest throughout the entire movie.Overall, this was a
pos I really enjoyed seeing this movie and it was hard to get a good enough sleep that I wasn't too tired. It was dark and very scary. I've been very good at it and I don't think that anyone who's remotely involved with politics should take this film too seriously. I think it is time to stop wasting time with movies like "Manos Â Hands of fate" and "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and maybe "Manos Â Hands of fate" and "Manos Â Hands of fate" but this movie is just as bad. A lot of bad acting. bad directing and bad acting. Bad directing. Bad directing and bad acting. Bad acting in general. Bad acting and bad acting in general. What a waste of time!
pos Time has not been kind to this topic recently. This is simply not enough time for this topic to occupy our time. I have to admit, I am tired. I really can't get my feet in the right place so I have to ask: where is this supposed to take place? Will the cast be as bad as they portrayed in the original? Will they make a good enough hire to make this show worth watching? Let's just say that Netflix is releasing quality movies which aren't exactly bad, yet still tame enough to actually entertain. Of course, you can still get good original music from either of these shows, but they are better with more "art". I've watched this without the help of a tissue. In fact, it has become easier to watch even though I've watched more of it recently. The music is OK, and the acting is still good. But the way you feel after watching the original is just sick. It just keeps you from being completely happy with this movie, and makes it appear like this is your favorite character in the original. If you were born around the time this movie was finished, and raised in North Africa, this would have been a wild and wonderful experience. I loved this movie
pos It's a rather thin story, based on incidents of mistaken identity and a mental image. There are a couple of interesting twists and moments throughout the story, however. The twist is that the suspected murderer, previously unknown to the local sheriff, now appears to be a former high school friend. The sheriff gets involved in a pitched battle with local sheriff. The village's sheriff gets involved in a pitched battle with a grizzled, overzealous local sheriff, in which the former gets his daughter's blood-soaked, in a nasty scene almost making it look like her aunt was in a mental institution. The village is overcome by hysteria, Karl depends on his trusted medical genius, and soon he becomes even more effective at treating the ailments of the local sheriff. This story seems to be a pretty thin plot, and it operates at the level of a book. In reality, it operates at the level of a newspaper story. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter decides to investigate the crimes in the area, and gets some feedback from local people who might be neighbors. Patricia picks up a grizzled hitchhiker who appears to be the local sheriff and gets into a pitched battle with the village's sheriff. Patricia is a relatively recent arrival to the area
pos So let's go over the top and we have one of the worst films ever made. This film is so weak it almost makes you forget how bad the original was. But that doesn't mean you should give this film a miss. You must be very, very disappointed. It has some really bad acting and budget, and it is probably because it portrays a different character in the story than most of the mainstream actors did. In other words, it portrays some really poor acting in the climax, and basically ruins the entire movie. Not even George Kennedy can save Cuba from sinking like a ton of bricks because he was so young. It is simply ridiculous how the government tries to uphold this terrible plot in such a weak way. This is not a good film. A terrible film. It would have been good if it had been called a horror movie, not horror. It would have been better if we could have made a stronger film instead of this type of thing. It is the greatest film ever made. All I know for sure is that this film is not like "Hooper" or "Silverado" as much as I like to think it is. I am not a big fan of the genre, so I can't speak
pos Very good movie with good acting and good directing and good directing. Plot = bad, bad directing = lame, bad directing = lame. Accents = bad, and actors = bad. What the heck - this one is a pretty lame movie. I've seen some bad movies but none of them this far. Not a bad thing. Bad directing = bad directing, bad directing = lame, bad directing = bad acting. The only thing that seems to work for this movie was a bad script. The acting was awful. I don't really blame this movie on directors, I just think that bad directing is the best thing in this movie.

pos Very good movie with good acting and good direction. Very sexy plot, but not bad. It was inspired by a novel. Not bad directing, though, in fact. Very sexy plot. I love the rats. They run fast and are hard to get them to like (even though I was at least a little frightened at first). I found the rats interesting, and they certainly make them scary. I love how they didn't have to work in some kind of "veteran" way and thus, I was able to get them to like me even though they were at home. It was quite funny how the rats were attracted to me. I found them particularly attracted to rats because they didn't know who I was.I would like to see a new movie, though. They certainly don't deserve this, and it would be nice if they would consider it a good idea to rent a different stage (one I like to see if they can find a different stage and maybe have a smaller audience). The rats were adorable, and they certainly didn't hurt the film too much. I wish I was more like a king than the queen (although the rats were adorable), because that would've been a very good reason to rent
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. It has taken the biscuit to think that a remake of "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (Yankee Doodle Dandy, Dandy's first Dandy) might be the best animated feature film I've ever seen. The acting is excellent, and the direction is almost comic. It also has humor (or at least, that is what I usually get from animated shows) and an engaging story. If you love the original Dandy story, then you should give it a miss! Don't get me wrong; it has definitely improved over the course of the series. I wish that it would have been done a more "character" movie, rather it would have kept the focus on Dandy instead of being a full-fledged Dandy Doodle Dandy Doodle. I wish Keenan could do better things with his direction and characters. It's easy to see why he liked Scooby Doo's style of acting so much. He did a great job at portraying the stereotypical characteristics and the stereotyping, but that is not the greatest part of his acting. I wish Keenan would hire a different kind of actor to portray the stereotypical characteristics of Dandy Doodle Dandy (Bran
pos Time has not been kind to this project, so I can only speak about it now: I can tell you that there has been some pretty good movies floating around this movie. Some of them are OK, some are OK, some are OK, and some are just plain fun. (One reviewer stated that it would be OK to do a spoof on the '70s disaster movie sound effects, and that they should have been done in a different language. Overall, this is a great movie about rock, roll, and roll. The only flaw with this film is that it has some pretty lame plot. There is a good reason why Rock musician Dan Harmon (the lead) should rewrite some of the dialogue in a more digestible style and less obvious place, and to the credit of his amazing talent. Overall, I can't say much more about this movie than the trivia. I highly recommend it for anyone needing an example of how to make a big budgeted movie, or a good parody of the original music.
pos Time has not been kind to me in my life. When I was seventeen years old I converted to narcissism. It didn't hurt that I converted to narcissism when the narcissist sexually exploited kids. I can still find a few bright literary and artistic things in my bookshelf that resonate with me. The narcissist had a vision and a few charming characters and yet he still kept himself out of the picture. Nowadays, it seems that the "media" that surround us makes it easier for the narcissist to get the few good books he reads, and keep his focus on other things.I like the idea of writing a nice, positive, non-self-absorbed diatribe against the narcissist, but I just can't seem to muster the strength to do so anymore. So, in conclusion, I thought this through, hating myself and hating the narcissist so desperately. That would have been a great lesson for us all, but this was just another lesson in life.

pos If you can't sleep, go to your local tv or movie theater, find it on the 3 DVD's you can get it from. You can get an American or an Indian (whom I like) and then enjoy it yourself. You may find it particularly heart-throated because of the music it has, the sound and the visual quality... I don't know, how long ago that happened. Maybe the movie "American Made" came out the year BEFORE the movie. I remember listening in wonder to albums by Peter Bernstein from 1968. And it came close to being the only CD in the collection. It was a real struggle because it came from Bernstein's collection. It was so much of a struggle that I ended up hating it.
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. In my view, it is simply awful good entertainment. This is my favorite martial arts film of all time. Don't get me wrong, it is good entertainment. Don't get me wrong, but I do think the martial arts movies pull you inside of a world that is vast and scary and scary and you must be a huge Bruce Lee fan. Don't get me wrong, the action is good and the fight choreography and the fight choreography is good. Not even George Kennedy (martin heiress of the Alamo) knows how to win this fight with a single shot. It was just a compilation of all of his favorite martial arts movies and ninja gags. I can't even begin to tell you how many people were in the theater and everyone who was there knew who the bad guy was but that's just me. The plot was good, the fight choreography was conducted by the best of the bunch. Overall, the movie is entertaining and has fun to watch, it's hard to give a movie 4 out of five stars but hey, at least give this film 2.5 stars and maybe a 1. Let's give this movie 3. Let's just

pos Very disappointing movie. What a let down.I've seen this far too many times and it was the worst I've ever seen in theaters. The acting was terrible. The story was predictable and did not follow suit to most of the movie's themes. Im glad the stranger got his comeuppance but it felt like a big snoozer for most of the movie. Don't get me wrong though, it was definitely worth watching. Not bad, though. The acting was terrible and did not follow suit to most of the movie. The only redeeming feature of the film was its message. The prank phone calls were so lame. Don't get me wrong, they were fun and they were funny. It was definitely not an enjoyable movie to watch. It is still an enjoyable movie to watch and will keep looking forward to see more films like this when it becomes available.
pos From an artist's perspective, it's like Star Wars. You don't have to worry about getting knocked backward in a big fight because you had to be in the side! As for the fighting, I don't really know much about the film. There are too many mistakes throughout the entire film. For instance, it doesn't follow suit to most of the above mentioned titles, and even though the villain is mentioned a few times in the credits, it's not in the title. The title should be obvious that this movie is a rip-off of the original, and therefore falls into the same category. This movie has been banned from the USA, and is now on DVD. This movie is simply disgusting. I really do not know what to make of this film and how to properly address it, but I do know that frequent cursing and sexual content is not in the movie, and that it continues to be very explicit throughout the entire film. The only redeeming feature here is the fact that all the CG animation is wonderful, and it was refreshing to see all that came before it was even finished, even as I got a few lines of dialogue out of my head! I also had to watch "Hooper" on V

pos This movie was fun and entertaining. I love animated shows and Washington Square is where I lived for a long time. The characters were alluring, there was just something about them that made them appealing to me and I can't get them to wear eyeliner all the time. But then again, Washington Square was where I grew up. Nowadays, Washington Square is a major attraction for many people. People come from all over the world. Washington Square is the capital of the USA. If I wanted to stay, I can tell you that the movie was 100% original. I live in Washington Square, so this is where I come from. My dad always insisted on keeping the movie on the TV, because he was sick of the constant Washington Square music in his collection. I can't help but watch the Washington Square "nonstop" play in my collection, because I can't help but think that it was filmed well before the movie began, and that it would have been totally wasted time on the telly if not for the actors, and especially since I have learned a little more about their sets in the original version. There were some brilliant scenes, such as when a newspaper critic of mine
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. We've seen this film many times before but this one bored us. I don't think this is an entirely bad movie.

pos The three main characters are extremely well portrayed, with Margaret Flynn Boyle playing the femme fatale in the lead role and Frank Borzage playing the creepier, tragic girlfriend of the late Patricia Borzage. Patricia Borzage is extremely convincing as the femme fatale, played with an added twist by the lovely waitress (Lydia) who was formerly a patient in the mental institution, and has only recently come to terms with the fact that she has no memory of the event. Patricia Borzage (Melvyn Douglas) also exudes wit and defiance throughout the movie, especially during her relationship with Patricia, played with a fierce, yet charming, yet charming yet irresistible force of will. Patricia Borzage is equally impressive playing the character, playing the femme fatale in the lead role. Patricia Borzage is obviously one of the more charming and irresistible portrayals of the character in this movie, playing the character's sister in a sentimental yet irresistible way that makes the audience glad that she is still with them. Patricia Borzage is also extremely convincing as the femme fatale in this movie, playing the femme fatale in an almost unrecognizable role. She has a fierce, yet irresistible
pos Time has not fully abated on these films, however, so this cinematic masterpiece has just got a whole host of new fans in.I highly recommend this film to anyone needing to experience this territory, as it is extremely well worth the wait and see if you can get the necessary sleep, this is a must see for those fans of "24", "In The Line of Fire" and "True", "Faust" or "Faust" cinema buffs. The special effects are outstanding and the fight choreography by Giada Colagrande provides a must watch for those of you who are looking for an overacted thriller in an over budget (e.g. "True", "Faust" etc). Don't get me started on the preview too early, folks!
pos Before I even got to watch this movie I was in North Africa. It was a wild time, with no neighbors to watch the same time, no neighbors to speak to me on the phone. My sister stays in the house with her mom and dad, and I have no idea where we are going. It was the perfect time to be in North Africa. And then...maybe...maybe it was the best western time in the whole world, but I don't know. The village was awash with palm trees, and the desert was the perfect setting, perfect setting. The desert was perfect for this movie, and the desert scenes were perfect. And this was despite the fact that the desert was far from the most spectacular, yet beautiful, yet was still a part of the story, and I found myself in the mood of the night. "Did I miss something? I saw the old village? How come they came to be here? I don't know." I sat down in the plastic rectangle representation of my tablet with the thought of the old people visiting and having a drink at the bar. The sound of shattering glass was the perfect background for this movie. But I still had to admit, I loved it. I actually

pos I saw this movie years ago and it became my favorite short film of all time. I loved it and became very fond of it. I like to think about how huge this movie is because of the supporting cast. I really like that Anastasia changed the entire movie to simply be her. It felt like there was no getting around her so easily. The love story is very sweet and touching. And the acting is wonderful. It didn't hurt that I didn't like Cinderella in this movie. It was fun to watch and all the characters were very intriguing and charming. The story was so frank, it felt like I needed to watch it all over again. It was also very good to watch the new movie. (Besides the original version of this film, and of course the remake of this one) (part 1 of 2) -I liked Cinderella and all the characters very much. I really wanted to see Cinderella II. I loved Cinderella II but it was so much more than that. Cinderella II is a real standout. Cinderella II is a real standout. Beautiful and enchanting and irresistible heroine. Cinderella is just as good as Cinderella in this movie. I love Cinderella II so much. It makes me wish that Cinderella II
pos Excellent comedy/drama starred by Dudley Moore and Dudley Moore, Eli Wallach and Larry King. Moore is Arthur, a man belonging to a multimillionaire family that has a son, but still has nothing against the King. Arthur is just a very good guy with an eye for showmanship. He is a good guy who always liked to show people that he is not only very good but rather kind and kind. To those who think that maybe Arthur is better character than Billy Madison, look up Arthur in the King's dignity and tell them that he is a very good guy. Moore almost always skits with good script. This is not a good film but Arthur does a great job at it. I think he did a great job at tying together a bunch of characters so they can all be seen by their very own special effects. I love the new King Arthur (Arthur) in this movie. It's very clever and funny and Arthur really grabs us by the proverbial balls. He doesn't give one guy "the meat" as a plot, but rather gives us a golden tip which he keeps us amused throughout. Overall, I think this movie is Arthur King Arthur II. Arthur was just a very good guy. I really
pos Very good movie,very good acting and music but bad directing. Good job! (Or, at least, good directing)I found this movie a little disturbing, especially in parts where the plot was predictable. What I liked about it was that the action was speeded up quite a bit and that was not a major complaint - it was just speeded up. Plot: 
pos Where are they now? Well, there are two stories in my mind these days. One centers around the murder of a young man named James Madison and the murder of his wife, Georgia. The other centers around the various ways in which James Madison was manipulated by an unknown third party to murder his wife, Georgia. So what the hell is going on? Let's just say that it is an interesting character study of Madison's life that makes me wonder...if this theory is true, why did he commit this terrible murder? My guess is that he was manipulated in some way, through social status and through his relatives. This theory seems somewhat at home with some of the more interesting twists and turns and there fore, there fore, it makes me wonder if the murder was in some way related to James Madison's own personal struggles. (There are other twists and turns in the book, notably, about his background in law, his taste for women, and his relationship with his wife.) In Madison's story the "good guy" got 750 dollars provided that he met a nice lady who was not his real fiance. After Madison met a nice guy (male friend/fiance?) he met a nice guy (younger sister/boy
pos In this preview I really wanted to highlight how huge the Rockling is and how much fun it is to be around. The characters are all there and very well portrayed. The story is very well paced and there are very interesting twists and turns which are all the more charming and fun to watch. The action is very cleverly put together and is very cleverly fleshed-out. I absolutely loved the ending. I really enjoyed it and would recommend it for those people who enjoy the Rockling. Don't get me wrong though, I just loved it. If you are a Rockling fan, skip this and buy it.
pos I like to see animated shows that are good, entertaining, and not too bad. However, the characters are flawed. Overall, it's a pity that they can't get all of the characters together and so they can't really work the two of them together, because there isn't enough time to really get the two of them together in meaningful ways. How can we possibly get a good grasp on what a good comedy is and what an enjoyable it is? How do you not love the characters? How can you not like a good character? It's a pity that a good character can be so bad for the audience at large. But it's also saddening to see how much more our sympathies for this character can turn out.

I thought the film would be much better off with more dialogue in it, but alas, it is now disposed of. I can still breath the breathing space it takes. This movie is great for those who love animated shows, and for those who love animated shows with a warm heart and a smile. It's a perfect portrayal of our little girl. It runs the gamut from "cool" to "huggable" like she was in elementary school. My guess is that the story will follow her through elementary school, through to the very end, and maybe through the next.

pos Seriously I loved this movie so much I turned down the proposed movie. I love how every little girl knew that Adam Sandler was the spy/villain and not the bad guy, she was just as sweet and kind as always. I would fill my head with books and trivia about what makes Adam unique and unique as a spy/specialist/specialist/specialist and then maybe even break it all down and give him some feedback on his recent crimes. It was so much fun to do this and so much fun to work with. I also loved how everyone knew who was behind the plot, even though I was not entirely sure who was behind it. I really loved the way they portrayed it and how it didn't hurt them as much as Adam did. Was it supposed to be a movie about an inventor of immortal souls or just plain old spook? If you can't love a good guy, that's a good movie to get you a few stars.
pos This extremely long film is actually an extremely good movie, and I highly recommend it to anyone wanting to watch it. Its main disadvantage is that the sound score has to be somewhere between MonoWhilst In this presentation the sound score is too loud, and the background music has to be distorted, and some of the effects are quite loud. The graphics in general are poor, and the story is almost non-existent. Overall, it is extremely difficult to understand what the hell this movie is really like in any other way, so if you want to get an idea of what the hell this film is all about then go find it on, it is worth recommending it. Worth recommending if you can't sleep, or at least avoid it (yes, avoid it, avoid it).
pos Time has not been kind to Giada in this short time. We had a disappointing start to the new movie in 2004 and we all know we were spoiled for not having seen it. It was only because we were young and not in the "media" for a motion picture, that we got sucked in. I'm sure that somebody out there knew about this and maybe it was just me. But I do not know.

neg In an interview with Jeffrey Konvitz, writer/director of "Nightmares" and "Nightmares" movies, director Frank R Strayer and star/producer Jude Law deluded themselves that their prestige alone could sustain their performances in "Nightmares" despite having minor heart failure. The result was an almost unrecognizable performance from Giada Colagrande's "Silverado" in "Nightmares" or even Giada Colagrande's "True" performance in "Nightmares" or even Rudy Latin's "True" performance here. The unpretentiousness of the dialogue and/or the acting almost makes it appear to be parody. At one point during the closing credits, as if unable to explain what happened to him due to an insomniac needing sleep, Law brings Lugosi into the film. After several tries (Stroker, etc.), she almost gets him to admit he was a big snobbery and basically just gave her his cancer a miss. No, not the greatest of all time. Once he starts to realize he had no idea what she was doing, she starts to tell him about her struggles with getting over her private parts in the early going. She starts by
neg This film suffers from the same problem: Most people get bored halfway through a film about how huge the earth actually is and they simply don't care much about the direction. That being said, even if I were in North Africa, the western half of Africa, and the eastern half of Africa, it would still get a laugh out of my goodie. This film has a good supporting cast that is expertly casted by Brad Pitt, and is obviously well-developed and entertaining, and Pitt is aptly geeky and charming in this film. Pitt is prickly and insulting to all the "good guys" around him (male, white, big terrorist, etc), especially those people who don't give him a chance. He also shows his love to a lady (Branagh) that he has no love in the world and he has nothing but contempt for her. This movie is not about love and no one should give this film a miss. I know this film is meant to be a fun and not-so-dynamic viewing. If it was about love and not the need for violence to be justified, then this would be the worst film I have ever seen.

neg After seeing this movie I became extremely bored. I was completely bored. I was bored with the dialogue in the movie and not even in the beginning of the movie. It felt like I was bored because I couldn't pay full enough attention to what was going on in the background. My brain was racing, I couldn't sleep, and I couldn't even think straight.

It was disturbing enough to make me wish for the release of Sylvain Chomet after her tragic death. Not in the slightest, I think, because I can accept that there are still films out there that aren't exactly like the original, but hey, at least I gave you a golden tip for life. And what a plot! I wish to wish everyone well in this film, and of course I would like to see more like this in the near future!
neg The depiction of a young Carlito steals the show off as a rather loony village in Mexico, where he is wooed by a local girl friend. After a while, a bored Carlito (whom I later met as a trespasser/invader) accidentally hits the little girl in the balls through the proverbial balls, causing her to fall down a no-good guy-throated stairs. After the third time through, another guy falls asleep in the laboratory, hating on the little girl and wishing for his daughter to die in his place. At some point during the episode, a bored Carlito accidentally hits a guy on the road who he thought was a trespasser/invader. The trespasser/invader is eventually captured and later told about it by his buddy, who tells the village that he has already been manipulated by local immigrants for his country. In the end, all that remains of the episode is a compilation of baseless jokes about immigrants. The plot is also very poor and thus the viewer is left with no other explanation as to why the invasion of the fictional town was justified. What really bothers me about this whole episode is that neither the village's police detective (Jose Ferrer) nor the village's
neg This movie isn't perfect but hey, that doesn't mean you can't get 100% of your blood in it! It just hasn't got what it takes to be a "good" actress in a bad acting. Donald Sutherland is just not as good as Leslie, the lower class girl you've been looking up to. Donald Sutherland has absolutely nothing against women in his movies but he gets tired fast at times. Donald Sutherland is a spoiled, bigoted, bigoted pervert and bully who should be ashamed of himself and worse he would be ashamed of all the women he has ever had to work with in his career. If you want to be a good, hard-working man with a brain roast going on in your face, get it from the very beginning to the end. You need to watch Sutherland's disgusting garbage get the few minutes it takes to get the few decent laughs it takes to get a laugh out of your life. It is simply disgusting. Donald Sutherland is a disgusting character and should be ashamed of himself and ashamed of himself. Donald Sutherland should be ashamed of himself and should be ashamed of himself and all his twisted twisted ways in his filmography. To be honest, I have seen this movie many times before,

There is quite a lot going on, but basically just satanic struggle and basically ended up in this one guy's throat, needing stitches to repair his throat and draining his blood till dead.So here is the deal.I have to admit that I liked it a lot. Not that much, I just can't seem to get over the guilt and hurt that I felt in it. The actors are not as gruesome or as gruesome as some would like to make you think. I don't think anyone can argue with that. I can't find anything against the quality of the movie, however, there is a good reason why I give the movie 3 stars and a miss -- I think it would be a mistake if they left open loopholes. The acting is terrible, and the dialogue is almost painful. It all came together in a way that makes it almost painful to watch. If I were in North Africa, I know that some of the actors would have complained to Africa about the acting and that I should have just showed them the location and not worry about it. But I guess the cast is decent and all the dialogue readings are decent, especially in the climax. I wish Alicia Silver

neg Although the storyline is well-developed and well-written, the characters are flawed and often feel flat-out. I had trouble fully explaining them to the audience during my time with the series. The depiction of the various characters is generally unfunny, the depiction of the relationship is generally unfunny and there is no grey area in between. The relationships are not as intense or complex as most of the previous films and there is certainly no grey area in between. There are two main characters, the sister-in-law of Regina and Regina's struggles with various men in her life, and the father of Regina's sister, Georgia. The sister is not the most kind of person, but rather serves as Regina's sidekick, though her father often gives her a hard look as a man when she is home. Regina is just as bad as her father, and worse still, her aunt has a very annoying small girl in the back of the family. Regina eventually gets the better of it when she is married to Georgia. Regina, Georgia's sister, often gets the better of it, especially in Regina's scenes where she almost gets her to "take a liking" on men. When she marries to Regina it is very funny
neg This movie is lame. I had no idea it would become an Oscar winner or anything like that in this world, but I will never watch it again. The acting is terrible, and the dialog is all speeded up and down like it's never been done before. Overall, this movie is just plain awful. I absolutely loved the concept of the Three Ages, and how the Three Ages relate to mankind in general. (Besides the fact that we live in a gloriously Westernised, pre-history, and there fore we all must be at least some kind of mental or spiritual help in coping with the various periods of human experience, etc.) - but I do find it particularly heart-wrenching that the Three Ages were separated from the rest of the world by the wall of time and were separated when it came into being. So, in essence, it's like the Three Ages are the same thing and that the Three Ages were forged in the same image (that is, of course, the Three Ages Certainly are still alive and well and well, but they had a different take on them when compared to the image of the Sun, and thus it continues to look better, better, etc. In conclusion, I think
neg This film is so lame you actually feel pity for it and all the time I wasted. I've watched it and have no doubts about it being pulled off as a rip-off of Akira or Black Mask but this is the worst movie I've ever seen. It has no redeeming virtue in it. No matter how bad the story, no matter how much you miss out, the conclusion will always be an enjoyable experience. I highly recommend it for those people that are looking for a good western to watch and a must watch for all ages and all levels of hysteria.
neg This is probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It was so bad that I almost died from boredom at the theater. And the sound and the dialogue was terrible, Horrible and cheesy. It had nothing to do with comedy and was so badly shot and must have been horrible in some way. It was a terrible movie, Horrible asides, Bimboil Bimboil, Bimboil Bimboil and many other bad films out there, none of them being funny at all. This was the worst film I've ever seen in theaters. And to top it all...this was a cheap rip off of Bimboil Bimboil and is still fresh in my mind. This movie was so bad, in fact, that I almost died from boredom. All this was inattentive boredom and boredom that it compelled me to watch it. I'd like to watch more like this in theaters, because I absolutely loved every second of it. But in the end it was just so bad. I wish I could have bought the movie, but not this one.

She has an extremely annoying small girl (Susan) and her very annoying, insipid, annoying personality. Her friends are very good, they always are. They always have nice to all around her, even though she is always so young. Everyone around her has a story. She has the good old English teacher (Matuschek) who always skits in with her, especially if they are in a good school, so we have a goodie in Latin and we have a nice girl (Susan). She has the nice topless play, which makes me wish every moment that we had a sister. I really enjoyed it. It was fun to have her come over and having her come over to see him for the third time. Overall, pretty entertaining, not bad at all.
neg This movie had absolutely nothing to do with film history, and was about an independent movie about a normal guy who loves big shootouts, and a guy named Rico who loves fast paced, fast paced action. Rico was very good in his role as the lower class trespasser on the island, but he still has a few mistakes throughout the film. The main character is a spoiled brontosaurus with a brain fractionally smaller than a pea, and he is so stupid and out of place that he almost makes you miss a shot when it's over. All in all this makes it all the more aggravating to watch. The villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans that are floating in a big ocean, and it's up to you to your entertainment to make them work for you. Rico is a thoroughly masculine creature, with absolutely no hint of a sexual nature, and yet he still has the look and manner of a maniacal killer underneath. Rico's insinuation that some subploidy young people are attracted to him makes the movie even more heart-wrenching, because the subtitles refer to him as a "yo".

I highly recommend this film, and I recommend it to anyone needing to get their throat slit open to watch an actual horror film. It is extremely disturbing, in fact. It makes you grind your teeth and grind your teeth with despair because it is the only movie I have ever seen that I can actually get my blood-bath complete. The bloodbath itself is a real tragedy, and I just can't get over it. I can't even get over how much I have to do to get my blood-bath to be worth it in the end. I would like to get some feedback on how this film is going to perform, etc.
neg This movie was about a movie about a boy's journey to get a better job, through a break up with his parents, and through an emotionally draining relationship that eventually leads him to true love. It was bleak and uninspired at times and at times felt completely at home with its cast, but not for me. It was fun to watch it all at the same time. I will give this film 4 out of five stars because I really wanted to watch this movie and because it is such a great film, and because it is such a great movie. I really loved coming to see "Dear Friends" every time I was in high school. The characters are such a let down. They didn't have the most interesting character relationships in this movie. They just didn't move along as much as you did. So here we have three thoughts about this movie. (One) I give you 3 stars, because I think that this movie really grabs us by the proverbial balls. (One) I think you should give this film 4 out of five stars. (One) Maybe it would have been nice to have seen a little more into the story, but that would have been OK.
neg I'd like to argue that it isn't the most entertaining movie I've ever seen. It's not about elementary school students refusing to do their best, it's about a gloriously righteous elementary school bully named Togar taking revenge on those who do not give him the most amount of love or compassion he deserves. It's not funny, it's not funny, it's just plain old dumb. It's hard to fully explain to my teenage son why he should have to live his life hating all the bad things the little bugger has to do, especially since he's only a wee lad. I'm pretty sure that loving every moment of the day would have been better for him and his life, and would have

neg Although I have no idea what this movie was all about, I can certainly tell you that the depiction of the Alamo is very disturbing. There are several disturbing scenes in the film, which can be seen in the background of the film. This movie has an awful long history of sexual violence, and I don't know if there have been films that have had that kind of a "san pedro" effect on movie fans. In fact, the history of cinema buffs and horror movie buffs is extremely well-documented. There is even a disgusting scene in which a young Alamo devotee (male) gets knocked backward over a cliff edge while in a sexual relationship. This scene nearly made me sick. Needless to say, I will give this movie a miss. I really loved every second of it, and will recommend it to anyone needing an example of how not to take horror movies seriously. This movie is so bad that it compelled me to register.
neg I realize that some people might be disturbed by the depiction of the depiction of Al Jourgensen, but as far as I can tell, the depiction was not about a movie about Al Jourgensen (the title character) in a wheelchair, and was more about the struggles of a man with memory loss and a wheelchair. Many viewers will comment on the way in which this movie attempts to uphold the image of the fictional character as though it were real. I don't care what your opinion is, nor how much you think. It is a good movie. It is a good movie about people. Respect them. Respect the person. Respect your loved ones.
neg This film is extremely weak and uninspired. You have a bunch of characters that you actually like and then you get sucked into this too by an over-the-top, high school English teacher with no fun in the making of any of the above mentioned classes. Things get a bit silly
neg This movie was so weak and did not really hve that much action in it. There were just too many sub plots and too many plot twists and all the characters were simply silly. It was a great mystery mystery and mystery that even though I knew it was true, I felt very bad for this small village, especially since it was so decrepit. The village's government wanted nothing to do with it and they wanted nothing to do with it. None of the characters were likable, especially the elderly father who always insisted upon seeing his daughter's play, even though he had recently separated from her. None of the village's
neg This movie was extremely weak and uninspired at worst. There were some brilliant scenes in the opening reel that were cut down completely because of budget, and a gratuitous nipple play was simply unfunny. The acting wasn't THAT bad either. Director Kenneth Branagh was too serious, and there was too much of gratuitous nudity. Overall, this was a good movie. Good job. Very good script, bad directing. Weak. Bad directing.
neg This movie is not great, but it is very good and very good. I've watched it and loved every second it has going. It is just plain fun to watch, and I think it's the best movie I've ever seen. It has the feel of being completely real. Of course the acting is so...amazing. I had no idea that auteuil style of acting was so good, but it's the way the movie is that really grabs me and makes me nervous, and I can't wait to see more like this. I really do not care who the director is. All I can tell you that it is great fun to watch and get knocked up while sitting in my uncomfortable seat at the New Beverly theater in Hollywood, because it really grabs me and makes me nervous. (Acceptance of my sexual desires. OK, OK, OK.

neg This is a great martial arts film with a brilliant cast, great acting, and superb acting and a brilliant direction by Michelle Pfeiffer. This film takes the biscuit and tries hard not to let it all fall apart. There is some hidden love and a lot of heart-throbs and rage and I wish Alicia Silverstone would come out with a stronger sense of humour and less bullying and bullying than this one did. But that doesn't mean it doesn't hurt to watch!
neg This film seems like an innocuous movie. There isn't much going on in it other than the story and dialogue. It's not that bad, it's just that I can't get over the scenery and sound quality. There's also not one of the many motion pictures that make it that much fun to watch.I really wanted to like this movie, so much so that I can't recommend it to anyone. Not that I didn't like the hotel in Denmark, because they would have to wait in line to get to know us. Not that I think it's a good idea to wait in line to get to know the location, it's just that they do it in bunched up into smaller sections and bunched them all in with music from Grieg, Dostocari, and even John Gielgud. It's not bad, it's just that it adds to the fun and makes it easier to connect with fans around the world.
neg This movie is extremely good, and at times its humor is funny. The acting is perfect. It's very funny and fast paced, and the villain is very well portrayed. The story is very well-developed, the plot is very well-developed, and the fight scenes are very well-developed. The fight scenes were very well-developed, especially during the climax where the main villain (martin ) runs the gamut from bad guy to hero in a very bloody, fast paced fashion. I stand corrected.martin is very good in his performance. His character is very well-developed in that he doesn't really need to be all that much in the movie to really hurt the person he is trying to hurt, and he doesn't need to be so much in the movie to hurt himself or the person he is trying to hurt. All his action is very well-developed and believable, and I can't think of anything bad about him in there.Overall, I give this a 4. 7/10.
neg This movie is extremely bad. There are times you feel bad for a movie, and then there are times you actually do bad and really mean something to happen in it. Sometimes you feel bad for a movie, and then you actually do bad and really mean something to it. Sometimes it is just me, and in some cases the acting is unbelievable. Sometimes the acting is so bad it makes you grind your teeth in the laughter and the lewdness. I had no idea what I was doing when I watched this, and I have to admit I've watched some funny scenes in it, but this movie just got tired fast. I don't know if I've ever watched a film like this before, but I did enjoy it. This was the worst movie I have ever had the misfortune to watch. I wish I was in North Africa. I can't find out how many movies that exist overseas can get me thru it easily. My aunt insisted on seeing this movie, but I was told that it would be OK.
neg The first episode was unremarkable, budget non-existent, and boring. The only redeeming feature of this episode was that it came out on the biggest cultural event of the 20th century, The Rose Festival. Rose wasn't even there. I can't even get my $20 in, and I was so far away from the big premiere that I couldn't even pay full enough attention to see it. The only other great thing about this whole film was how much I love every moment! This was a great film for those people who appreciate being able to experience real life as a real person in this technological world. I have read a great many books on how to become a better person and how to become a better person, and I've watched numerous films about this topic. I absolutely loved this film. I loved how everyone knew that this movie was so great, and so funny, and so very funny. Everyone loved it. It's funny and energetic and all the characters are so well-developed, and even though they may not all speak Spanish, I can still get the few lines or similarities we would like in the plot. Every moment is like a journey, and it's fantastic to watch it in the literal, non
neg I saw this movie a couple years ago and it became my favorite movie of all time. It was so much fun to watch! It was fun to see the new faces and the new faces of all those lovely little bugger fans! There was more action than the original movie and there was still humor in the story. This movie was fun to watch and alluring. Was it fun to watch this movie again? Was it fun to watch the new faces of all the male cheerleaders in the movie? Of course not!
neg This movie wasn't bad, but it was just plain fun. I really loved how Anastasia changed the look of the faces in the movie. It was really nice that Anastasia changed the look of the girl in the movie. I really wanted to shoot some crazy close up shots of her in the desert and all over the desert like I often do. How cute she was! (Or was it?), I don't know. I've seen some crazy close up shots of her in the desert during my time away from home. These were the worst things I've ever seen. I don't know what happened to them, but hey those desert scenes were worth watching if they came into your collection.
neg In terms of quality and content I am pleased to say that this is the best movie i have ever seen and that it has the best script i have ever seen, comedy, drama, romance or romance. Not a bad thing, I just think that Technicolor came out with an extremely disturbing turn of it. Strange enough that it continues to struggle despite its flaws. This movie had me very excited for it and i hope whoever out there can understand what it is and then maybe get a better grasp on what it is.Technicolor is an extremely disturbing film and thats why this movie was released. Strange enough that it was able to achieve the heights of the original movie, i believe its the best script i have ever seen. Technicolor has an extraordinary cast of talent and thats why this movie is such a must see for all viewers. Highly recommended to watch this movie if you are a thoroughly bored of cinema. Highly recommended for anyone wanting to watch a horror movie in the same time period (normally during the second half of the cinema), and to get a good grasp on the plot it would be very important to get it out of your mind.
neg This is a terrible movie. Its plot is poor, overall it is just plain boring and basic. Im glad I bought this instead of the cheaper western release, and I wish the creator would hire more writers. I know the story was predictable and the ending was predictable. But I had no idea that Sofia Coppola was going to make such an expensive, cinematic horror film, and that Sofia Coppola was so discriminating, in her taste. The only redeeming feature of the movie is the sound and the visual arts. (If you can't speak French, I know the accents you have had in your life. I can't speak Spanish, as I was born in a liberal Spanish, though I know a great many of the characters are related to each other well.) The acting is poor. The supporting characters are either poorly written (even though we all were very good in our part), or simply plain unfunny. The plot simply doesn't follow suit. Sofia Coppola could have written a better script, and maybe she would have
neg The movie is just plain fun. Not following the guidelines, no matter how high class they may be, there are still tons of fun and quality acting and dialogue. Not that I complained. I did not expect it to be that bad, but I did not expect to get much of a laugh out of it, as expected. Director Kenneth Branagh is still entertaining in the movie. Don Cheadle is still entertaining as always and I enjoyed the confrontation between Anisio and Ismael during the climax. The only
neg After seeing this movie I became extremely bored, and resorted to watching western films (with the exception of "True", "Faust" or "Faust" movies). For those that enjoy "Faust" movies, "True" or "Faust" movies, keep an eye out for "Faust". It is hard to get me thru the long, drawn out story in these films, and still not enough words to get me thru it. I have learned a great many things from this movie, and can still breath the breathing space inside these shorts and novels. This is just as good a book. (and maybe even better) a good introduction to how to make or break free of boredom with boredom.
neg This movie is so much of a rip-off of GJ, and I've watched it several times over and it has become my favorite movie of all time. I loved it and will watch it again if I can find the time to do so. My wife and I are very
neg This film isn't perfect, or at least it didn't deserve a miss. I think it was just plain awful bad enough. Let's just say that Sofia Coppola deserved a lot of blame for this. Director Kenneth Branagh should just go to Africa, make the bad films about it and maybe even break a sweat in his new filmography. I was totally bored. The story seems a bit silly at times and maybe it is because there were too many close up frames. Director Kenneth Branagh probably won't bother rehashing the plot and conclusion. All that being said, it is extremely disappointing. Overall, this is still a disappointing film, but not as bad as we were expecting. Overall, I will give it four stars. If you like the original movie look at the rest of the cast, keep an eye on the funny side. If you liked the original it, keep an eye out for this film.
neg It was not an auspicious start to a career. I had been given the role of director for this film by a lovely lady (Susan) and I have always been very fond memories of her. I have watched a lot of bad films in my life and have only recently learned a little about this film. I was very bored throughout the entire film and thought that maybe this would have been a good idea to simply copy and paste some of my favourite short films from my CV. Maybe a better idea?I dunno, maybe I'd like to find out more about this film, maybe even get some feedback
neg My husband was working at Burger King when I was done.I was in North Hollywood about 5 years ago when my brother came over. I saw several horror movies on the weekends and it became obvious that I was sick and tired after having lunch with my family. When I got home, my wife (my sister) and I were racing home to see what movie the kids were going to see this coming in the coming-age.We had a screening of "Friday the 13th" on the 3-D and I ended up in my uncomfortable seat in front of the TV, waiting to be reunited with my little sister.We sat down to watch "Friday the 13th" on the couch with my tablet in my palm and read some horror movies. My thoughts were confirmed by my vision, the sound of the sound was disturbing, the music was very dark and it compelled me to register in my head, watching horror movies in my head. How can anyone be surprised by such a movie!?
neg This is not so much a film as an actual documentary about the famed boat that was stolen en route to the Dominican Republic. There were far too many mistakes in the making of this film, as well as in some of the making of the video. The cameraman deliberately kept everything out of focus and placed his thoughts in the viewer's mind. These days we watch documentary film about the history of the boat and its people, but this documentary is not about the sinking of the Alcatraz. It is a historical tale about the Alcatraz and its people and their struggles with the sinking of the Alcatraz in 1846. The Alcatraz was the first nation to come up with a comprehensive, non-sanitary and controlled
neg I saw this movie at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival and thought it must have been my favorite horror movie in the whole film history. I know horror movies are great and unique. But this movie was totally wasted. The prank phone calls, halloween night, a psycho, some kind of mental disarray and a psycho's way of life all came together to make this movie seem like a mere dream. It would have been nice to have seen a little more into the mystery surrounding this mystery and how it came to be this way. But hey, this movie was fun and scary. Not to say this movie wasn't original. 9 out of 10.
neg I am very pleased to see that Technicolor has finally made its way into the mainstream. Many films are so successfully that they can be enjoyed without being watched on cable or from DVD. Unfortunately, they still have to struggle with a basic level of content. For example, most of the action is overacted and budgeted. The action is poor, giving a dull effect to the movie. The fight choreography is poor. The fight choreography is weak. It is weak and almost all of the characters are either "stumped" or "kicked" during the fight. These characters are lame and thus should not be in the running of the show. The conclusion is a very poor comedy. The fight scenes are unremarkable and thus wasted time. The plot simply continues to pile on and the conclusion is a good lesson in life for those viewers.
neg This film isn't much fun or movie at all, it just shows how much we all do to get along with each other. It is funny, and at times I feel a little bored. But if that's not enough to get me thru the pain, then I must consider this film for the entire film. What an exceptionally poor excuse for not doing this! I really must have watched it all over again. It was hilarious how everyone laughed at the end of it and how much they all knew how to make a film about the Depression yet not one of the two loved ones was there. It was extremely hypocritical of course. To all of you who think this is a great film, get the hell out of your t-shirt and get some REAL love.
neg This movie is a rip-off of "The Ramones" and its predecessors. It is extremely weak and weak, and even though I am completely bored of all the dialog and dialogue in this movie I still can breath the breathing space that it takes me to. Its plot is lame, lame. It seems like the director wanted to give all the players "permanent record" and "permanent record" - music, direction, etc. I like how they all talk about their love and tragedy/homosexuality/homosexuality in the title and the movie continues to play out. Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting to slap "The Rock'n' roll" fans out of fear of being discovered, or those who expect an "early night" in Hollywood, or of course, the mystical, "American Tragedy" or whatever that the director intended. (If you were born into this "American Tragedy" culture, skip this if you can't get 6 to 8 hours of sleep, and maybe you'll find it in your blood "campions" shortly after this movie falls apart.
neg This was a major disappointment and I have no doubts about it. The 3 DVD's that were released in the USA were actually OK. Not great, though, but then there were all the promotional material and the sound quality was excellent. I liked the new music and the cast was believable. The plot was also interesting, and I would recommend it for anyone needing a plot to understand how a civilization can work. (If you can't get enough sleep, avoid it!
neg In terms of quality of film I would say this film is still among the best westerns of the 90`s. And that being said, it is flawed and budget non-existent. There are too many mistakes in the making of the movie.Consider the following:1.There is no "logic" in the title. There are several mistakes throughout the film. I felt that instead of being a great mystery or mystery its main character was played out in a very real way, by a French actress playing a very different role in the same film. It is a pity, however, that Sofia Coppola is playing a very different character in the film. She obviously has more to work with in the story than most of her male lead roles. Her handling of the plot was also very poor, especially the way in which the film attempts to explain things to the viewers about how their very own personal crises can lead them to true love and happiness. The Plot is poor, overall, and the acting in general is almost painful and almost painful. It is very well-written and efficient, and is at times brilliantly satirical. (Let's just say that Sofia Coppola truly deserves better standard of critics than this
neg This film is mildly entertaining and very funny. It has nothing to do with the plot, it has a good cast that is made up of decent actors and a good direction to it. Overall I enjoyed it a lot and it was enjoyable to watch. Of course the story established our protagonist as Chrissy, we had Chrissy's foot in the door when she fell down the stairs and it was all over in the end and Chrissy's foot in the stairs. I wish we would have seen the same amount of blood or graphic sex in this film but maybe it has something to do with the fact that it takes place in a rather twee English village called Bressford, England. It also had nice to have had Christopher Walken and Heathcliff around to provide some feedback and direction on the story.Overall it was enjoyable to watch and enjoy it.
neg It was filmed well, with good acting, good direction, and I like the acting, I was very excited to see this movie coming along. It was released a mere four days ago. But nowadays, it has been watched over and over on DVD. And I really like animated shows, and this movie was the best movie i have ever seen. It has made me appreciate the subtleties of the characters and their relationships as much as I can. It has also kept my interest in movies like "Hamlet" and "Don't Look Now" which I always recommend to those of us with more experience in film and television. It is hard to get me to like a film that I like, so I ended up watching it when it came on the way.
neg I was reading some great books in Latin before slipping out of my mind and into a mental disarray. My mother had written a lovely diatribe against her daughter about how hard it was to get up, especially since I was in such a terrible, horrible house. My sister insisted on keeping me in the dark, and I had to ask her to do it. She insisted on keeping everything out of my way, even keeping an eye on the television. Needless to say, I turned it on, almost died from boredom.
neg This movie is so lame that it makes me wish for more movies like this. I really wish Netflix would drop the crap and focus on more important things like this instead of releasing "holiday horror" movies. I'd like to see more like this in the near future.
neg I am extremely disappointed. The story was so broken it almost compelled me to give it another go. I will definitely recommend it to all those people who are depressed and want to get better, and if you like upbeat, fast paced and action, this movie is for you. This movie is for those people who can't sleep, because they are bored or too tired. It is extremely depressing how many people get depressed every single
neg I thought it would be interesting to delve into some of the mythology surrounding this movie, historical inaccuracies, symbolism and symbolism. This movie is extremely good and makes me wish that we all had seen it or were near it years ago. There is so much going on in this movie that it makes you grind your teeth with despair and yet still can't help but watch it with my whole heart. The movie is a good introduction to the history of mankind. It really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing and quality. It is very good and I would recommend it to anyone needing an example of how to make a film about mankind's struggles and their relation to each other. Of course there are a few mistakes here and there are moments that make it stand out in all its myriad beautiful beauty. But to me this is so much better than a compilation of Harry Potter romps. I have always found this movie to be a good introduction to my own personal journey, not only in regards to the mythology, but also to the films themselves. (Besides the history of mankind, this movie is just as good as the Harry Potter movies. Of course, the Harry Potter movies are classics of the genre. They really brought us together
neg This movie isn't great, but hey, at least it's good enough to get me some sleep.
neg This movie is so broken that I turned down a chance to see it in the theater. I watched it for close to two hours, and by the time I got over it I was done with it. I sat down to watch it all at the same time, hating myself for not having seen this far in my life, hating myself for not having watched this movie at all. My wife actually laughs out loud at the end of the movie, because she knows it sounds exciting to her. "Did you miss something? You were very quiet throughout." I was sitting in my uncomfortable seat, watching the whole movie on my tablet in my head, waiting to see what movie the kids were
neg This movie is a perfect portrayal of modern day slavery and the horrors it has wreak on Africa. There were two great empires before us, the empires that had been in Africa for centuries and were slowly but surely fading. The Natives of Africa were engaged in a pitched battle over one of Africa, and had no chance to win. There was no such thing as a Yellow King in the early 90s Africa. This movie had no chance to fail in its conclusion by setting our protagonist (male) Spencer Tracy, Michele Carey and her partner, Andrew Williams, in such an impromptu sexual relationship that Michele almost died from his throat in the last twenty years, before he even got married to her. There were several riffs and references to Africa, some of which were made in the book, and some which were poorly worded. This is not to be confused with this movie being about Africa. The Natives of Africa were engaged in a pitched battle over one of Africa, and had no chance to win. The battle was won by the Alliance of the Five Venoms. (This movie is not about Africa. The Alliance of the Five is an independent, non-racial, Christian and non-racial nation, as the Alliance
neg This movie has got an interesting cast but the story and direction is not so great. There is so much going on in the story that it makes me nervous even though I have read a good amount of the script. (Besides, this movie is extremely disturbing)So I thought this would be a good introduction to the series, if not for the location. All of the characters are very well portrayed (even the main character, Georgia) and very well-developed (although it is not written very well), and they all had very interesting personalities and motivations, as well as a very disturbing turn of events (e.g. the start of the movie, in which one of the main characters, Georgia, is the first to die, after several tries were made to her in some way, and eventually gets her thru it). There are twists and turns and allusions and plot twists and all the while at the same time very interesting. I love how the western scenery and dialogue is almost painful and yet still very charming. There is a very charming scene that just keeps my interest throughout the movie. The effects are uneven, and I can't speak about them here, because they are very important to me. I will say that the actors
neg Although there were several brilliant visual performances in the opening acts and some brilliant acting the supporting acts, this is still an enjoyable movie to watch. I highly recommend this movie for anyone needing an excuse to do some serious reading. Highly recommended.
neg I have no idea what happened, I am very disappointed in how far along the story was. I did find the story somewhat interesting during the course of the movie, as well. There was indeed some suspense and intrigue, and the plot was somewhat whiny at times, and I wish that the movie had kept this up. However, this is one of the better westerns of the 90`s, and its good to see the westerns come alive and not be watered down in some way. There were too many riffs and references thrown in to make this a good movie, and it is well worth watching. I really enjoyed this movie, and can't recommend it enough. Definitely give this movie 3 stars.
neg From the start Pressburger's witty detective William Powell dissolves into a gloriously entertaining low-grade garbage in which he attempts to explain all the characters' characters' motives for murder by pointing out that they all had minor mental issues, some of them even worse than Powell. Powell dissolves into a pile of cr*p and continually rehashing the plot, which eventually leads to his own murder. This film has no fun in the end, and tries to uphold the mystery regarding the killer's identity and motivations despite the fact that Powell dissolves completely into a pile of cr*p. Powell dissolves into a pile of cr*p in what appears to be the most logical sequence in the entire history of this film. As the story unfolds, Powell dissolves into a pile of cr*p in what seems like a mental disarray. At one point, he accidentally hits a roadblock and accidentally hits a road sign near the end of a highway. Powell dissolves into a pile of cr*p. Powell dissolves into a pile of cr*p in just 88 seconds, before turning in the phone to a local sheriff. Within 90 seconds of meeting with him, Powell dissolves into the most entertaining he has
neg This movie is one of those films that makes me wish I was back in North Africa. When I was a kid I loved the mythology of Africa. I watched westerns with my dad and we were taken to watch "The Nutcracker" and "Tiny Africa" on Saturdays. My favorite Africa was Africa. I love Africa. Africa, Africa, Africa. I love Africa. Africa. I love the culture. Africa is so different than Africa, and Africa. Africa is so much different than Africa, and it is Africa that makes the most of the movie. Its story revolves around the struggles of a newly-installed God. Africa is Africa. Its culture has not changed over the centuries, and it still has many of its stars. Africa is the "Land of the Melts" and the "Place of the Nutcracker" (corny Africa). The Melts are still budding empires and empires that will come after Africa for good and have a chance to do good in the future. It also revolves around a great, beautiful, and unique nation that has been wiped out by the Storms, during the course of the Melts' invasion of Africa.

neg The plot is extremely poor and there are too many scenes which should have been shot in between 3:00PM and 4:00AM.I was geared up at the beginning and it was a mid-way through when they started to tell you that a certain movie reviewer had written the script. Not even close to elementary school could save this from sinking so fast.Okay so what?! Let's get started! First thing first, this movie is awful good, bad, bad, bad, bad, bad...it just didn't deliver on time. I wish I could rewrite it better, better, maybe even maybe, maybe maybe, make it more digestible. I have no idea what is in the plot, other than that it seems like there is a hidden plot. (Besides the fact that it is a cheap rip-off of a horror movie) So let's get started. Say something to me about my background: I was in high school, in some classes that were very gruesome and had a lot of blood in the theater. My favorite character was Miss Ruby Rose (the one who was so evil, I turned her into a "Homer Simpson" after seeing her almost died from boredom) and her boyfriend/boy
neg This is not a good film. Very disappointing. It is a little film about the Depression yet falls flat due to the fact that there is absolutely no violence in it. It is not one of those films that tries hard to hide behind a story that seems aimless at the worst. It is just plain plain depressing. It ruins my feelings and makes me wish for more films like it. Of course, the Depression yet again provides opportunity for despair and despair. I have always been depressed because it continues to happen, but this time it seems to me that I am more disturbed by the constant stream of life in this mental institution. So, let's just get this out of the way: it is not a great film to get carried away with despair, it is a great film about the Depression and its psychological power, and how we all feel about it. And its heroes are the people who try hard to get the few few things that they can get back in order. Its villain is the unpretentious, pretentious, bigoted, bigoted bully. You see, in large part, why people are angry and hurtful, because of course they were "enjoying" the trivialization of their feelings, the trivial
neg A nihilistic martial arts film that revolves around a young man's life that revolves around a team of people that try to find his way to a better school, through an interminable series of pointless arguments, through an almost-open minded teacher, a gloriously righteous man that ultimately gets his way. It unfolds like a long story, with twists and turns. It unfolds like this in a totally unexpected place: A nihilistic martial arts film about a bunch of guys that want to get better at their school, through hard work, and through an interminable relationship that eventually leads them to a better, more worthy of their investment. When they do find themselves placed in an uncomfortable situation, the first thing that they do is simply to themselves, by setting things up and using their minds to do so. Everyone gets slaughtered in the end. So to call it a good film would be an understatement to say that the film is extremely bloody, with an eye-poof cruelty to living creatures. Overall, it is a film that tries hard to uphold the martial arts as the
neg The main character is played by an entirely new cast, auteuil (male lead) and a French actress, Georges Remy-Lachaise. The film features young Brad Pitt as Kitty the caretaker of a pet shop, and is highly rated. (His younger sister is French actress Julie, so there is no question that he is French and he is French-speaking, and therefore has to struggle with English, as always.) Pitt plays the typical rapper bad girl in a low key, in a bad role, and basically in a mental institution through her whole teen years. Remy-Lachaise has a very good supporting cast, and is very convincing as Kitty's boyfriend Leo, so we had a great screening. I absolutely loved this movie. Definitely recommend it! (where are the stars?) I was very excited to see this film, and it was such a let down in the end.
neg A gem comedy starred in 1934 starred in 1934 Mel Gibson's 'Stay Puar' (Mel Gibson's version), Albert Whitlock (Bobcat Goldthwait's first-class, first true buddy/cop) and several other good-character actors. Gibson is best remembered for his Monologue in The Patriot(acceptable, but Gibson's direction relies on more subtlety), but he is entertaining nonetheless thanks to the cast.The plot is extremely well-developed and has a warm heart and a warm heart. There is humor to the point that you never know what happens next when you hear the good guy tell you that there is a plot and that somebody out there is out with a mental or artistic thing. It is a tragedy that no matter where you are in the world you will always be cheering the bad guys and that no matter where you are, you will always feel vindicated and taken by the love of your country.
neg This film is a compilation of recycled material, mostly recycled of discarded junk, mostly made-for-TV. Its villain is played by Dudley Moore, and its antagonist is played by a blustery Dudley, who wants nothing more than to be remembered as the "young Dudley" in the Dudley family. Dudley's charm is obliterated by the unsuitability of Dudley's new identity by an old man, played by Dudley's sidekick, who is equally bad in every single moment by Dudley. (Both men had better luck with Dudley, and both of them were nominated for this film as a major, but not all!) It is humorous in parts, with good duration of lenght and plain old English, and at times brilliantly satirical in the end. Moore almost gets the most out of Dudley, but not all that. Moore almost always skitters a little when faced with the possibility of being asked about his background, so that he almost always skitters out of the room. So we have here a spoof of Dudley's life story. If you can't get the humor out of your life, drop the film into your local video store, find something else to do, and maybe pop in the "media", and maybe
neg This is just plain old boring and nothing special. It has nothing special going for it. If anyone out there is going to comment on this movie, PLEASE STOP USING BORING BORING!!! You must be very, very, very, very, very, very, very, very young. Its not the greatest movie I've ever seen. I was only 18 years old. This movie is a sore disappointment and I wish I could have seen a better movie. It continues to pile on and pile on with the more pointless crap. The plot was never touched upon nor did it stray too far from the book, no matter how bad the movie was. I can accept that there were some brilliant supporting characters and a story that made me appreciate the subtleties of the story. But it is the greatest movie I've ever seen. I wish I could have brought this up to a better standard. Maybe I missed something important in the intro, but the ending was perfect. Maybe this movie should have been pulled out a little deeper. I wish we would have seen this movie.
neg This movie is fun to watch. It is clever, scary, funny, and I can breath the breathing space it takes to make it believable and scary. It unfolds like this: 1) A midget thief steals a big diamond and gets it back (very cleverly) by
neg This movie is extremely weak, giving the impression that the government is trying to find some kind of excuse for their handling of the situation. Of course, in fact there are several mistakes throughout the entire film which seem to me to be related to the government's failure to uphold the peace and order in this area of the world. For example, the line of dialogue in the opening scene is cut down to address the problem and the audience gets a good laugh out of it. However, in the closing cutscene, it alludes to the arrival of a "san-san" (male) in the morgue, asking for medical attention and then immediately going on to make a mental dissection of the dead. A great hero of the peace movement has just died, but the message is still there. Nowadays we are all too young to do such things, and we certainly don't want to see the bloodshed and the bloodshed. This movie is a perfect example of why it is so important to remember that lesson. This movie was uplifting, funny, hopeful and hopeful. Not many films are able to recreate the feel of youth and independence we had in mind when we were young.
neg I've seen this movie many times before, but it hasn't really touched me as much as it has on me recently. This was a fun and funny movie that I enjoyed for the most part. It would have been nice to have been able to watch this much longer, though. My husband has a hard edge and I am admittedly too young to have children, so he waits to see the video until he has a chance to do so. My thoughts were confirmed by the behavior of the other kids in the house. My thoughts were confirmed by the behavior of the couple and the behavior of the couple. This movie had no fun and did not deserve this kind of rating.
neg This is a wonderful film. It unfolds like Cinderella's tale, and has all the characters and the setting, etc.. There are some very interesting scenes (one of which is an old monk's life) and a very good cast (with a good cast, and an engaging plot, etc.), but the whole film is fantastic and all at the same time makes me wish Alicia Silverstone was here. It is hard to get me to like a film like this because of all the characters, but that's because I love how the story is so well-written, and it makes the entire movie worth watching. I highly recommend this film for those who love animated film comedy, and I recommend this film to all of your kids.
neg The villain is aptly geeky and has a taste for big budget movies. But his villainy alone won't hurt him too much in the end. The only redeeming feature is the fact that he was able to convince me that this movie was made in America. (Besides I have to admit that I did not watch this movie in a good way because I live in Scotland and did not like it in the USA but this one enraged me). It is an extremely weak plot that I can accept for the sake of all time and I am not surprised to see why. The villain is just plain stupid. What's doubly depressing is that he has resorted to directing his own personal greed at the expense of the greater good and the life of the company. How many people know that the fictional railway porter in "The Nutcracker" (who never got an A, B, C or D in his life) was just another giant plot device to his advantage. The real villain is none other than the Nazi Hall Monitors (martin sheen) who want to keep their Nazi Hall hostage. (Or, rather, they want to keep the peace and all the Nazi Hall Monitors alive by making them pay for their crimes
neg This is one of the best motion picture adaptations I've ever seen. It is funny, every bit as good as original. I loved the ending to the movie, and it had me laughing every time the villain came out. It was clever and abrupt. I also like the fact that the villain was so stupid he couldn't even make an intelligent character out of him. I loved the confrontation between the main baddie and the lower class trespasser, and that was just icing on the "goodie" roll. All in all this movie is entertaining and fun to watch in all form, all at the same time. 9 out of 10 stars!!! The Plot and Acting are excellent, and the villain was extremely stupid and insulting to all the cast members. The acting was perfect, it was believable, and I can't find fault with the villain. This movie was my favorite. Definitely recommend it for those people who love comedy and want to see more.
neg This is a remake of the original Molnar TV series (2002), a classic of the famed American show. The new project is extremely difficult to follow and budget nonstop action-horror with predictable violence and budget-consciousness. The acting is a bit dodgy, and there are too many mistakes throughout the story. I found myself laughing a few times in the climax and the conclusion. It was definitely not worth it. Even the ending wasn't as gruesome, I was just sourly disappointed and cheated a few times throughout. Not a great movie for my liking, but this one was worth it. The producers should have kept the storyline somewhat hidden. I wish I was in North Africa and the Far West, but that is just me. I'd like to see a real Molnar invasion of Africa as the climax, as well. (There were several great cultural events which we all must have seen on the USAID World War II '23.' Primarily, the siege of Budapest in which the prime minister, the defence minister and a whole host of their forces were slaughtered by Hungarian, Pembrook Feeney and many others. This would be the worst movie ever had it not been for the original.

neg This movie is extremely disturbing and there are a lot of gratuitous violence used against women. Sexuality of women is not something new in Hollywood. In fact, every time a film is made I get the feeling that somebody is going to make an example of it and try to get it to drop them again. It ruins the film and I wish the creator would have
neg This film is a compilation of Harry Potter movies and non existing Harry Potter movies revolving on the same themes and treatment. The themes are similar, there are a few decent Harry Potter movies which are similar and there are a good many good Harry Potter movies which make the audience appreciate the different things about each character. However, it is highly recommended to watch this movie. It is extremely difficult to actually put my finger on all 31 of these movies and yet, it is well worth it if you love animals and want to explore the world outside of your own personal world. The Harry Potter movies are classics of our school books and are classics of my favourite movies. This film is so good it makes the entire class tremble in fear. I love them and I will definitely recommend this movie to my friends.
neg From 2001 to this movie it is well-written and acted. The plot was not all that bad, as explained in the opening narration. It was just plain bad. The actors were terrible. What I mean to say about this movie is not a very good movie at all. I can find no other movies that really hurt you in the way this movie does. It was so bad that they made you miss something important. All the while I was reading about this movie, and even though I had seen this movie a few days before, I still can't help but wonder if it has a special interest for you. Maybe you can find it in your local cinema, too.
neg This is not so much of a rip-off of Akira as much of a rip-off of what it is today.

pos So far, this movie has been extremely good. I've watched it several times, it was my favorite since it was first released. But as soon as I came across it I realized that the cast wasn't all that bad. It was just... uneven. And then this movie had all the rage in it. And I just wanted to watch it again. Was it supposed to be the rage of a bunch of rage sneakers? I thought so. Not so. So... now what? Let's just say that the Plot was a lot of fun. Don't get me started on too long, though, because this is the best movie i have ever seen.
pos The first movie I ever saw was about four blocks away from where I lived, so to speak. When I got to see this film I totally got the "dream" feeling. It was like seeing "Doctor X" in the shops, orchid village, that sunlight-enjoying creatures desperately seeking our company. This film was the "media of the future" for TV, and to be honest, this film probably made me wish that I was in North Africa, but that would have been totally different. It wasn't that bad either. I wish that I came across it years ago. It was nice to see the contrast between the two "good guy" reputedly "regular" Hollywood type of movies (not that bad, mind you); the contrast in the close up of the 2:1/23 scene between "Doctor X" and "Dear Friends" almost made me wish I was out of Africa. The 2:1/23 scene was a real standout, and was definitely worth watching. The special effects were excellent, and were definitely worth the wait. The action was perfect in the extreme, and it was robotic in places, but that doesn't mean it was robotic in this film. All the action
pos This film is a satire of an old movie about a spoiled brontosaurus. The director, however, was very good at portraying the various ways in which this new-found creature came to be around, and his taste for animals attracted a certain certain certain large animal in particular. Many viewers will find the film's humor to be very different than most viewers will get used to. Many viewers will find it particularly heart-wrenching, because the production values are so high, and so are the visual schemes, the acting and the acting. The film's villain is not only bad, but is an added insult to all those who appreciate its qualities. This film is extremely poor, overall giving credit to the small screen (even though the director deliberately kept the focus on the "philosophical, artistic, and artistic" part) and to its cast. This film suffers from the same problem the rest of its charm: too many important scenes are cut, some barely believable, some really hurt the feelings of the viewers, and some really hurt the film. The supporting characters are just plain unfunny, and so the movie drags on for most of the two hours, and then it becomes extremely difficult to actually get a good laugh
pos This is the second part of the movie series, and the result of many different stories and a compilation of other stories. In the course of this movie I seem to find myself reading, watching, and rehashing old stories and reworking them over and over again. It's a little hard to
pos This is a gem movie with gem lines from Grieg, Bressart and von Niemann. It is bleak and hopeful, and revolves around a love story revolving around an inventor (Joseph Schildkraut) that finds love in someone else. The love story is also very dark, involving some very dark territory. It has some very dark themes, such as the relationship between the man and the woman (part of the mystical mystery surrounding the inventor) and the relationship between the two men. It is bleak and hopeful, and very well-written. It has an extraordinary cast in small roles, and a warm heart. It is bleak and hopeful. I admire the fact that it is bleak, but not at the level of Bressart's that I can find here. It has good supporting work by Marlene Dietrich and Katherine Heigl as well, and Jo Swerling as Kitty, who never let down her tragic end. This is the kind of film that I give the greatest wish and wish that my film would reach a higher level of maturity and maturity.
pos I saw this film about four years ago. When I saw it I became extremely excited about seeing this film. My first reaction was "Wow!" Not so much, but it was worth watching and having FUN! It runs into the same vein as "Silverado" and has an extraordinary cast that includes Marlon Brando in LV. 8 and David Ogden Stiers in LV. 31. I really enjoyed it and thought it would be interesting to do an interracial sex scene. I love surprises. I love surprises. I love surprises. And this movie is not so much different than White Chicks if you can't get enough of them in this movie. Its funny, action-packed, and you really can't help but watch it! I highly recommend this movie, even though I have watched many other films on DVD and it continues to look a bit silly. Its also very clever how to get some good players involved in the plot (even if it isn't the most obvious plot point), especially since the characters are such a let down of class and so are the director. So I gave this a miss! Yes, this is an extremely good movie, and I would recommend this movie to all my friends.

pos This film is just plain fun to watch and is fun to watch and all that. There are a lot of characters (I'm not a huge fan of those) and a good dose of humor (I like to think that the jokes are better in this film) that seem aimless at best and at worst just plain plain unfunny. None of the characters were particularly good and thus this movie is just plain fun to watch if you can get the two hours that it takes to do it all.The plot is a bit dodgy, overall giving the impression that the main character (male lead) is a bit young and he doesn't really give much of an introduction as to the characters (but boy, she really comes in to the role quickly and gets the part fast and there's humor in the movie) who seem quite confused at first when they meet, they don't really know what they're doing and then eventually (put simply) fall in love with each other. This film seems aimless at first but I think it was really meant to be. I've watched the whole film (yes, it was filmed in 1-2 hours) and thought a lot about how this would have been played out in a different time
pos Back in the 1980s Hollywood was releasing prestige films like "Silverado" and "Silverado" with John Gielgud, Barry Bostwick, Burgess Meredith, and many others. It wasn't until 1968 that I saw a true horror movie. It was Buster Keaton's "Hamlet" or Billy Madison's "Stroker" or Billy Madison's "Rage of the Master" or Braveheart's contribution to King Creole on screen. But then Buster decided not to give his feature-length feature-length feature film the veneration it deserves, and instead resorted to directing a smaller film which never advanced his career. Buster Keaton directed "Hamlet" and wrote lyrics for the song. The film features the life-or-death struggle between love and death in a hapless heroine. The love story unfolds over the course of a single-character romance involving four young men who unwittingly end up spending their youth in a mental institution through a machinations by paramour. This film does not follow the lead but rather simply follows the lead. The plot unfolds over a four-year period. The young men are given a rare, mystical, spiritual, or spiritual power by an unknown spiritual teacher called the

Not so many that I know how to get them to like it, it would have been better for them to simply skip this and focus on other things and focus on simply reading about it in books. The characters are so...amazing! The story is so...amazing! The acting is perfect, it's simple to see why everyone loves it so much. Everyone who loves this show would definitely recommend it to them. If you like surprises, don't wait for it! The kids love this show! Go to it!

After a while I realized I had seen many bad movies over and over again, and maybe even more recently, this movie compelled me to register with LV. 8: "What the hell!" And what an ending it is. If you can't get me to like this movie, go to LV. 8. Don't get me started on a fast paced road trip!
pos It is well worth watching if you can get it on DVD. DVD is great, it runs well and I bought the entire movie in it. The acting is perfect. It stars Arnaud Desplechin and Michelle Forbes as Kitty, a lovely little girl who loves to support her mother. Jennifer looked great in the movie, the acting was perfect. She was such a great actress. We have to admit though that the pregnancy scene in the climax was not as good as it has been. I just had to watch and maybe it would have been pulled out in the conclusion.
pos Timberlake wasn't THAT great in 2004, but this is still considered one of the great cultural events of the 20th century. It has always been viewed as one of the great cultural events of the 20th century. It was a major cultural event in Britain during the early 60s and a major cultural event in the history of England. Its biggest event, i.e. the King's Test, established England as a major power during the second world war. It also brought together some of the best performances and cultural performances of the 20th century, and promoted the production of the "Hamlet". The production of the classic top of James Arness's "Hamlet" came to an end, and James Arness as captain of the regal force, made a fine finish to it. Sir Ian Holm has written and directed several television plays for this classic musical. You can't get enough of this great stuff. There were barely any extras for this great cultural event.I love the format, the cast, the direction and the direction. The acting was perfect. Every moving and charming sequence was filmed in high school, perfectly controlled and perfectly controlled. No matter who was in the film, there was still an essential
pos Of course, this movie had better be titled "Silverado" or else it would become a cultural myth. Its villain was a serial killer, not a hero of the American or European mind but a spoiled, bigoted pervert. (Let me assure you that none of the above were the plot twists from "The 6th Sense" in your typical "wronged guy" territory, the rage of the maniacal killer being able to slice up innocents while still on the mark is a good thing to happen to those people who are frightened of being frightened of being slaughtered, especially those of us young and impressionable young people who are often frightened of being young again. (Acceptance of blame for most of the crimes in this movie is a tragedy; the killer must be at least some kind of mental or spiritual, or both. If they can get the few few lines out of this movie and then drop them into the appropriate "dark territory" they can still achieve great things. They can make their mark with witty character interplay between the maniacal killer's insinuation about being attracted to women, and the giddiness of the bed frame as if it were some kind of natural thing.

In this day and age mankind has a variety of spiritual and natural things to do. Things that we do not do well in school are expected to do well, especially for those who are poor, and especially those who are poor, in particular those who do not take
pos Time has not been kind to Hollywood this has never been rocky in Hollywood. There were several films that relied on location, location, location-set, budget and actors to make their movies, but none of them really hurt Hollywood, Hollywood was just happy to let all that crap drop. This was not a good movie at all and should not be this bad. All in all, a great movie! I loved the dialogue, the acting and the direction... it was a great trip! And the supporting cast and crew were outstanding! I am seldom surprised by movie endings, so this film was the perfect solution. I wish Alicia Silverstone would do better things to 'Stay') and 'Stay', but she was still very good in this too, she just couldn't hide it. She even gave a great performance here, in the marvelous "I Saw What You Did" scene where everyone forgot their lines and had to do their thing in a totally uncharacteristic way. I love the love story in this film. I know that the heroine's love story is beautiful and the love story is sweet. I really can't say that I gave it a miss -- I gave it a miss. I think it was essential viewing, because it
pos Time seems to be on the side of good and evil. The villain of this film is a spoiled brontosaurus; I missed a key plot point in the movie. I was geared up at the beginning but the tide turned in my direction when the caveman started running around demanding *everything* be shot. This theory seems to be verified by the caveman. My special favorites were "Tiny Crocodile" (the caveman) and "Lionelionelion". Little does he suspect that his new creation will eat more of our blood than we give him, because he hides in the cave, waiting for the tide to turn. Little does he suspect that this will happen in the coming future and will replenish the blood supply in the cave. Little does he suspect that the caveman has dug up a big treasure hidden away on the island of Creole and is now

pos Very good original. Very good acting. Very good direction and sound effects. Very good acting especially for a western movie (where did they come from?) The story is pretty dark, as are the characters. I'd like to argue that it was written by ROSE HISTORICAL, who is more responsible for the sound than most of the other cast members and is more responsible for directing the movie.Very good acting for the westerns.Story:Very good, good direction and good script.I would recommend this movie to anyone wanting to see more dark comedy (with more bloodshed, bloodshed etc).

A lot of bad acting, a lot of gratuitous violence, budget non sequiters and most of all, a bunch of white actors playing bad guys pretending to be nice to all the poor people in Hollywood. It's like they owe everyone a big, big, big, big, big, big shock." Jennifer Jason Lee is the sweetie closet queen that you wouldn't mind missing out on. Don't get me wrong, I love her and wish we would have never seen this movie again. It's funny, not bad, but at times...I can't find words to tell the story, the plot, the characters...the plot...and I have to ask the director if he would mind directing the movie. "Acceptable movie!" Jennifer Jason Lee, Georgia, Georgia's sister, and I was married to her for a few years. It was kind of like the "boy's dream" to finally have kids.
pos Very good movie. I will give it 4 out of five stars if it continues to move along.I love how Anisio looks and outfits and looks great here. I had trouble with the Sin City outfit in my thirties but now that I have seen them in a thirties they look great all the same. The desert is definitely my favorite place and they had the legionnaires at their side. This was definitely my favorite part of the movie. I loved how Anisio looks and how he keeps his face perfectly controlled whenever he is asked for his opinion. Of course, the actors are alluring, Marlene Dietrich is charming and Anisio looks dewy and alluring as she is in this film. The graphics were also very sexy and engaging and all there was drama in the entire film. I loved the concept of the Sin City in this film and will go to see it again, as I did recently.
pos The film continues its story about the Three Ages prostitutes, the Three Ages prostitutes, who were near to condemn their crimes. This means that the Three Ages prostitutes were not mere amateur sleuths, but rather, a real estate-based enterprise run by an old monk. The Three Ages prostitutes are mentioned numerous times throughout the film. This means that while there are no truly supernatural or supernatural elements in the story, we get a lot of what we like - there are a lot of good, historical, and interesting character witnesses (Jose Ferrer, Georges Remy de la Madeleine), and there are a lot of bad women. In general, there are a lot of good historical inaccuracies here. Many of the main characters are mentioned (Jose Ferrer, Georges Remy de la Madeleine, and Giada Colagrande), but there are also a lot of bad women, some of them mentioned quite a bit in the dialogue, and some of them very well-developed.

I think the story was predictable. However this movie was a great film. The action was very good, and the direction was also very good. It was a great fun movie to watch and I wish I was in North Africa, but not so. The only problem I had with this movie was that I got too young to see it in theaters. It was so bad. I can barely wrap my mind around the plot and characters (obtained wisdom from my trusted medical genius, Dr. Lorenz) as they were so young and so evil in this movie. I wish the USA could give this movie a chance, and maybe even a miss! (Besides, I watched it for a long time, and it was fun to watch it in it's original language...maybe it was my imagination. But I still can't help but wonder if the story was a good lesson for those of us who love Middle

What makes it more interesting is that instead of being an artist, he gets hired to do some real estate business. In addition to being a part of a real estate real estate project, he also takes a job at a New Beverly for a real estate agent. Though he is not entirely bad for the entertainment he brings, he still has talent and he still has an extraordinary talent pool. James Cagney provides an entertaining (if not top of class) cast as well as an engaging (if not top class) narrative. Overall, James Cagney is entertaining, entertaining and entertaining. I would give him a 7/10.
pos Excellent comedy with an intelligent cast, compelling plot and an intelligent and engaging story about a young reporter who discovers a hidden treasure hidden in her home town of Wyoming. Her story is well-developed and well-developed, and we have the perfect plot. There is humor and a lot of love in the story. This movie had me in stitches after the third time I saw it, and I felt terrible about it. I wish I would have kept this up, but I guess it has now been out of print. I will probably watch another feature film in the near future. Perhaps this one will become more digestible, but this is still a good film. Very good comedy. The story is well-developed and well-developed. Overall, good comedy with good duration and an intelligent cast. Very good plot. I loved this movie. Was it worth it for a laugh? Was it good?

pos Time is running out for us to get another movie to see this time round. I won't bother rehashing my thoughts because I will give my thoughts here shortly. This movie was 100% garbage and was made worse by the constant promotion of "your average rapper" lyrics and a gratuitous nipple play. Music, acting and direction were not even in this movie. The only redeeming feature was the fact that all the supporting characters were either too young for the role, or too white. None of them had the charisma or class to make this movie worth watching, which I found myself laughing out loud at. Not many movies give you a chance to get a good laugh out of a rapper or an American, and instead the only thing that lifts you to another level is your own performance. This movie is not great, but its still worth it. Not bad, but it is still enjoyable to watch.
pos This film is just plain fun and a great mystery about a black girl growing up in poverty in this village. It is bleak and it has an extraordinary cast (Milo, actor, actress, and programmer) all suitable for a rainy afternoon in Budapest, Hungary.

(ii) About a Hungarian village that does not have much in common with the rest of the European immigrants that are here, the village is simply beautiful and has a story to tell. (iii) About a Hungarian village that has an old railway line, and a railway station that they can use to get around easily. (iv) About a Hungarian village that has a railway station.

And to top it all, this movie has been voted for best horror film ever. To call anything other than "festival goings on" would be a gross understatement. This film is simply genious and worthy of veneration. To simply be genious, without being too serious, this film is a must see for fans of all ages and all levels of entertainment.

pos Time has not advanced as expected as this film has. I can say that this film has had a very good time, in large part because of my very good directing (I had to watch the entire film in my home town, and in part because I had to constantly check on my local video store to make sure the location was in good repair), and also because the acting was so perfect, the script was perfect. It was funny, the dialogue was perfect. It was uplifting. I love the characters, the setting, and the eclecticism...even if they were a bit silly (for me, at least). I can't think of a better way to put it than this...references to previous movies... (whereas, "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" is probably best remembered). In the Stone Age, England, Alfred Junge was King Arthur's spy and underling. Arthur decided not to go, and so Arthur decided not to join the Alamo. Arthur, too, lost his memory of his youth, and the rage of the rage that he feels is still fresh and raw inside his being. Arthur decided not to join the Alamo, for fear that his country would be

I particularly loved the ending because of the snowball effect that happens when you realize that your friends have no idea you're friends and that you had no idea that they were all along the same boat when they met. I really can't find an excuse not to watch it again. And, I can tell you that the entire cast are very well cast. Everyone gets a story that makes them happy, even if they are alone. And the supporting characters are very well-developed. I particularly loved the way the new love story was able to connect and connect with the older sister in this story.

It has an extraordinary cast (Jim Nabors, Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, Dostudel Duyer, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, Burgess Meredith, and many others), but its message is still the same: People can do anything they want to do and still get the job done. It centres around a bored man named Ismael Atwill (Branagh), who desires to become a doctor (Susan) through the machinations of an unknown third party. To complicate matters, he also gets involved in a murder mystery surrounding a young man named Ismael Atwill (Joseph) who was given a rare earth-bound dream by Clara Novak (Lydia). The plot unfolds like this: Atwill, after convincing Clara (Dudley) that he is truly a vampire killer (Joseph) through the machinations of a bloodbath in a women's home. Atwill then takes the life of Clara (Lydia) and forces her to adopt a son from a seemingly "good guy" family. Atwill, through the machinations of paramour Spencer
pos This movie had an interesting cast. It had very dark humor and was definitely not original. I found it particularly hard to get a good laugh out of the characters. One of the main characters was a spoiled little girl (Boyle). I liked her personality a lot, but it didn't hurt that much. I found myself laughing a lot and it felt good to be honest about it. I don't know much about the acting in this movie, but I was able to sympathise with her throughout the movie. Was it hard for me to get the actors together after seeing the movie? Not so. There was no need for one of the main characters to be butt naked during the climax. I love the acting. I love the acting and it keeps me amused throughout the movie. All the characters are likable and everyone gets a story in. I love the way they all had sex scenes. The acting was believable and they had fun with each other.

This is one of those films that tries hard to break free of the shackles and shackles we all encounter in the mystical and spiritual world of the Three Ages. The spirits of good people try hard to find the strength to do so (martycanthrope, espionage thriller, etc...). But they will always find it (martycanthrope) inside the home, or the spiritual world. It is an extremely important part of the story, and the film is extremely well-written, and very well-written. I would like to give this magnificent 3 DVD an even better rating than 7 out of 10.
pos This extremely long movie is extremely weak. The plot seems to be completely pointless and simply takes us through a pointless and pointless road trip in search of some kind of treasure or something. However, it is still a fun film, and it is well worth watching. The graphics are good, and the acting is conducted ex-off screen. I found myself laughing a lot while watching the movie, and thought it would be interesting to read some trivia on how much the villain was going to do. The Plot...maybe its how far in he wanted to go...maybe he just thought his character was such a good guy. Not many people know much about this villain. But that's not what lured me.

pos So, it's time to give my honest opinion about this movie. My suspicion is that whoever out there earning a living should get a decent dose of "Happiness" every time they see this movie. Its plot is well-written and it works excellently well. I give this movie 4 out of five stars because I absolutely loved it and thought it would be a good movie to watch if it wasn't for 3.5 out of four stars! Its main disadvantage is that the story is almost completely devoid of the fun and the plot twists occur in between shots. The action is a tad contrived, but its a good lesson in how to make movies that seem like the most fun they can get away with. I am pleased to say that this movie is not bad, but rather good entertainment. Worth recommending!

pos Before we get onto the content of this movie, we must first of all talk about how we all feel. I don't like the guilt and there are definitely elements of it in this movie. There are two things that seem to keep me from being completely honest. One is that I felt that the guilt was still fresh inside me, even though it has hardened over the years. I've always been very quiet and I really can't speak to my thoughts now. So the guilt seems to come from somewhere inside me. Not entirely unexpected or at all. The other thing I felt was very bad, because I really, really felt bad throughout this movie. I realize that some people liked it and some people liked it very much more, but I can't help but think that maybe it was desperation, desperation or desperation for social status to get me a better job, or worse, to finally get a job, despite knowing I had to do it in order to make it realistic and irresistible. This movie has just the opposite effect. The guilt is now obliterated by the guilt of the guilt of those around you. Now, to those who think this movie was a horrible dream come true, this movie is just as good, fun and

All the characters had personality, yet there were barely any sex scenes. I also loved how Anisio had no character in her story. There were so many nice touches (e.g. the way Anisio had "dreams" about her in the movie), that it was easy to forgive her for not being a great actress.

The plot is interesting, and I really enjoyed the confrontation between Sheila and her dad, and the fact that it was one of the few comic book climaxes I enjoyed in the early 60s.

I was not scared at all during the making of this film. I was extremely scared and lashed out because it was so scary. So I guess my fears were confirmed. The ghosts inhabit the earth and continually cause worry about your safety and your sanity. I was completely bored throughout the film, and even though I was scared in some places, I still can't help but get a good laugh out of my head. This movie is simply awful. Its humor was lame. I felt bad for two hours straight through the entire film, and even though I was laughing out loud at the end of it it, I still can't get over how much
pos This is a nice piece of work. It's very clever, and it runs into a good conclusion. It's kind of like a romantic comedy in a romantic farce, and it just keeps on going. I particularly loved Marlene Dietrich's version in this, because it was so much fun to watch and all of the dialogue was so original. It's hard to actually put the words out there in a way that makes them seem like they were written by a different writer. I really can't get over how serious this is. The whole film is beautiful, and it's the part where the love story was so frank. I can't get over how much I miss it. I mean, I miss that the love story in this movie, and so did the actress in the original (that sunlight!), because they had a nice little boat in the middle of nowhere that they could have hidden away. I also miss that love story even though I was near to miss it. I absolutely loved this movie! I absolutely loved it. It was a
pos I can't really speak to you about this one, because I can't seem to find anyone in my thoughts to comment on it. What I can do is to be brief. There were several films that were good and bad, and I watched "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" over and over until it finally came to me. I watched it over and over, trying to find something that I could actually watch it, try to find the sound that came into my head and I couldn't find it. My thoughts were confirmed with "Shanghaiist" which I found on VHS. The film does a decent job at tying together the characters and their relationships, and the story revolves around a rather twee village girl that happens to be the local 'villain'. She is rather sullen, yet charming and irresistible. I found it particularly heart-wrenching. This film is an enjoyable watch, especially since it unfolds so well, it keeps you all in the loop and makes it easier to connect with other things.I particularly loved how the supporting characters were alluring, such as their love of the "dark" side of things and their struggles with various characters in their relationships. This film was also
pos Time has not been kind to Hollywood this film has not been kind to Hollywood in Hollywood. Once controversial adaptation of Jeffrey Konvitz' best-seller, "Silverado" flopped to DVD. There are barely any extras, and the producers were unable to convince a single Australian to come in and save the day. In principle, Hollywood should be ashamed of themselves. It is understandable that a project can turn out so badly, it continues to stink in your living room even though you're in the company of an American family. Even so, it continues to stink in your living room even though you're not even in the company of a family. This film is not about the murder of a loved one, or even the guilt of the accused, it is about the guilt of those involved in the plot to get the upper hand in the "accident." It is about proving that the guilt of the accused is not just a matter of personal greed, and it also shows that even though you are not a multimillionaire, you still owe it to your family to make the most of your time away from home. This film is about a woman's guilt, not just about her looks or the way in which she was manipulated,
pos Where are they now? Well worth watching if you can!
pos Before I made this movie I did not have much fun to watch the original movie, though I enjoyed it a lot and did enjoy it a lot.

pos Time has not been kind to this project, but this one has brought together so many different stories. It has grabbed my heart with different characters and is still fresh and irresistible. The fairytale/dynamic western scenery (which I love) complements the enchanting coulisses of the lake in beautiful rural England, with the enchanting nature and the setting, creating a sentimental, sentimental love story. I love this little village, the setting, the setting, and the setting...the enchanting coulisses are still fresh and irresistible. 
pos The mod is not perfect nor does it follow suit to most of the older movies. Its main disadvantage is that it is so weak that its weak actors are forced to struggle to get a good enough performance from the good guys. This means that even though I know the mod is good and the story is good, I still struggle with it in some parts and still get thru it. Its speed was not great and I couldn't get over it in my efforts. It was like trying to jump off of something and then
pos This film is not as good as your typical "holiday horror" horror movie. It is very dark and budget non-existent. This is the worst western film I have ever seen in theaters. This film has no redeeming virtue for being so weak. The only redeeming virtue for me is the fact that I was able to watch it without my blood and graphic novels in it. The acting is awful and the dialogue in between the two main characters is just plain awful. If I were a huge horror fan I would give this film 2 stars but none of them really gave me a chance to register. I'm not a huge fan of Ang Lee but she still has an exceptional talent for portraying such a weak minded character and is still a fantastic actress. I wish Keenan would hire some decent writers and directors to write the script. I'd love for Keenan to re-write the ending of the film in her own words as well and maybe even break some mould in some of the characters so she can find a new voice in the making of the film.
pos It is considered fashion to highlight every social evil in every social evil movie, no matter how high class your sympathies may be, as a result of your watching this movie. We will address each and all of them here. 1) Sexuality - Sex involves touching, fondling, fondling, fondling feels good in bed, and even touching oneself is titillating and arousing. 2) Tragedy and/or sexual nature - sexual orgynas are not usual fare for most people in this movie, as they tend not to be. 3) Sex scenes - most notably, the "kissed guy" scene, scene where he finally gets "all the way" and gets his hard, hard edge in again, because of a lack of focus or purpose in his presentation. I give the movie 3 out of five stars, because I thought it was a really great movie and I will definitely recommend it to all those fans of this movie. If you're like me and are looking for an excuse to get into the movie business, I highly recommend this movie, because it has got them in stitches after the party.
pos So, you're going to want to wait and see if this movie makes it to the big screen, folks!
pos Of course, it isn't all that bad, though I just think it adds up to a lot to complain that Technicolor is so broken in that you actually have to work it all the time. That being said, this is a good, fun time to be around.
pos This movie is very good and entertaining at the same time. I really enjoyed it years ago but this is just not enough now to give this film an even chance. I will definitely recommend this movie to those of us who are fans of "holiday horror" and "horror" movies. I really enjoyed the first half hour of it but it was only because of the cast. I really can't get over all that bad acting in it and I wish we would have seen more like it in the future. This is one of those films that will keep my interest throughout the day, it's a perfect excuse to stop by and
pos I found myself laughing a lot throughout this movie. Not laughing as much as I usually do and this movie was really fun. It was funny how Anisio (the wife) and I couldn't help but laugh in the conclusion after seeing it. My dad is so funny and so is his daughter. I wish I was here. This is where I live.
pos This is the greatest martial arts film ever made. This is one of only two films that I own that are nominated for Best Actor Oscars in America and the most recent being THE GODFATHER OF THE CORNER, and are nominated for Best Actor Oscars in the same film (with John Gielgud). The other is THE GODFATHER OF THE CORNER, in which I won't bother rehashing the trivia here, because I will simply rehashing it with my friends and family.I really enjoyed watching it years ago and it was fun to watch it again. The special effects were a little over. The action was good, especially in the climax where the sword fight really began. It was good to see a bit more of the blood and graphic sex scenes, the sword fight was good to watch, and some of the bloodbath scenes were funny. Definitely recommend this movie to those who love the martial arts and want to learn more about their martial arts from a newly-installed school. See it for yourself!
pos Back in 2004, writer Marcos Gabriel gave us this gem gem about a man in Texas named Jack, a man that makes Texas-based graffiti in an old newspaper ad. It was the perfect little piece of exploitative self-conscious self-absorbed New Mexico, as Gabriel said. A perfect portrayal of a stereotypical Texan character. Its humor was first introduced as a nod to the American dream of being a native Texan, and then the rest of the film followed suit with an engaging set design that makes the entire film about as intense, meaningful, and engaging as Gabriel's truly great performance was simply breathtaking. This film is simply beautiful. The simple fact that it doesn't really stray far from the mythology of the book, and doesn't really stray too far from the view of the true heroes. The story revolves around a man named Travis (martinography) that wants to prove to himself that his love to Victoria is real, and that he is indeed a man of considerable repute and ambition. Travis has a fierce, swashbuckling pirate exterior but has a sweet heart and a smile underneath. He has a fierce, swashbuckling pirate exterior he often taunting Victoria with a kiss or two, as he
pos Time has not advanced so drastically since the '70s when John Gielgudier broke ground with Al Snow (who wrote the 1972 screenplay, Tom Tykwer, Brian Keith, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, Burgess Meredith, and many others). Unlike many early great literary greats (with Anthony Burgess Meredith and Keith Baxter), John Gielgud's (with significant prodding from director Arnaud Desplechin) and Gielgud's (with significant prodding from writer/director) beautiful and stylish new musical numbers (with names like 'The Crocodile Hunter' and 'The Mystery of the Wax Museum' etc.) these days are filled with beautiful, fast-turns-of-your-thumb collaborations by Gielgud and his sidekick, Gielgud. This biopic takes us on a
pos This film is a gem of cinema history. It is extremely well acted, and tries to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles, and has an extraordinary cast. The acting is suitable for those of us who love westerns and want a good western, and we love them both. I love the acting and the direction of the story. We live in a very small town in Hollywood, California, and we love the acting. And we love it all, especially Brad Pitt and the movie "Silverado" and the entire cast is as much of a part. And we still can't get enough words to call this a "Beau Geste" for that kind of feeling. I will say that the acting here was very good, and even the direction is suitable. The action was filmed well, and Pitt really grabs us by the proverbial balls, which are the heroes of the movie. I really loved his direction as much as I did, and the direction was perfect: not too bad, no bad. I just think that this is one of the better westerns I've ever had the misfortune to watch, and I know that I must have watched "Silverado" over and over again, every time. I can't speak to how

pos Of course, a good start to an interesting career, especially since it is the perfect storm for a spoof of '70s disaster movies like "Manos Â Hands of fate" or "Silverado" or whatever. Marilyn Manson's contribution to the making of "Manos Â Hands of fate" is a perfect example of how far a spoof can take your film to the next level. Marilyn Manson has certainly lowered herself to the most ridiculous of her career, yet you can still watch the whole film with absolutely no problem. It is one of the worst films ever made, in fact. (Besides Herring, there is this fine-tuned version of "The Rockford Cradle" which is one of my favourite westerns of all time.) This movie takes the viewer on a long, rambling voyage through an old rural England in search of something positive and spiritual, beginning with an insipid love story (the love story of the bloke in "Manos Â Hands of fate") and an almost mystical, mystical love story (the love story) that almost seems unrelated at first. Actually, I found this movie quite entertaining to watch in my teenage years, and I greatly enjoyed it very much thereafter
neg The Theory Of Flight is an extremely weak excuse for a plot to let everyone know that your plot can be altered, and thus, it works very well. Once we get the upper hand, we have an opening plot that seems to deal mostly in relation to the nature of things in this world. For instance, we have a synthetically made biological creature that doesn't speak, so we have to explain what happened to it. In the Stone Age, mankind was made to do things because they were given a special place in our heads.
neg This film is an extremely poor portrayal of the famed siege of the Alamo. The production is extremely poor, overall giving the impression that the siege of the Texas fight is simply a "cop-up". A number of key characters are either poorly developed, badly moulded or simply plain unfunny. Many of these characters are simply plain unfunny, as is often the case in most of the film's running time. Overall, I can't help but wonder if the production values have fallen over the years. Perhaps it has simply fallen flat because of the fact that many of these characters have already been mentioned or are now fading, such as when Texas A's first black friend falls in love with another woman, Georgia. If they were to go the whole production over again, this would undoubtedly be the result. If they were to go the whole production over again, however, this would undoubtedly be the result of a poor attempt at casting. If I were to rent or rather
neg This movie had no violence, no lewdness, no lewdness and did not deserve to be picked on by the gay community in this nation. It had a message to say about all men and women - men should be ashamed of themselves and to themselves. But it also enraged me because, frankly, I found this movie to be completely devoid of any redeeming virtue. How could anyone possibly have expected this movie to turn out into a cultural myth? Let's just say that the gay community has far less compassion for such trivial jokes and that instead of
neg I know better than most people that the depiction of Jeffrey Konvitz is extremely disturbing and insulting to all viewers. The only redeeming feature of this film is its humor, and the film's villain, whom I won't bother citing. Once again, I must say that I give every PG rating I can get my $1.50 because I did find myself laughing a few times while maintaining my sanity. Of course, this film has moments that really hurt me and the film really grabs us by the proverbial balls. This film is a sore disappointment.
neg This film seems aimless at best and at worst it seems aimless at worst. The producers deliberately make it appear like a satire to make it appear as though they are making fun of the poor person who is sick and tired of writing about their illnesses and what they are doing is wrong and insulting to those around them. It is an extremely poor portrayal of our illnesses. It portrays a different picture than what is actually depicted in the original US version of this film. (Besides, it shows that the geriatric ensemble of nurses, who always look puffy, always try to make things worse and yet still get through and still look "good" to nurses when they do find out what is really bothering them. It is extremely depressing how little attention this film has been given to this topic. I don't know what happened to my wife and I just didn't see much action in it. It was a long time ago and I still can't explain all the sudden changes we had in our ways, but I guess it has all started to happen now. My wife is sick and tired of writing about her illnesses and how they hurt her and I just couldn't get enough sleep to do it this time. I can tell you that I
neg I can actually tell you that there were some really great acting and some really bad acting in this film. The problem is that, in this technological age of incredible special effects, there were barely any extras. We had to put up with some pretty lame acting but basically all that came in was recycled material. What an exceptionally poor excuse for this film, and it continues to be in no way good to see in a bad light.I sat down with my tablet in silence for the third time in my life, watching this with the pre-credit cards in my palm and thought to myself, "What the hell!" Then I went to the local video store and bought 3 of those awful bad films, and watched "Kalifornia" or something along the line, and here are the 3 bad films. There are some great acting in all the bad films. (There are also some great acting in "Kalifornia") But these films had the nerve to be rated R.Nonetheless, it still blows me away how good the acting in this film is. It's fast paced, action packed, fast paced, and budget non-existent. The acting is terrible, it's speed slows down to address the viewer's mental issues and
neg This movie was extremely good. It was mildly entertaining and fun to watch. I absolutely loved the concept of the Three Ages. I also greatly enjoyed it as a kid. Watching it alone or with friends is not enough to sustain the constant school shootings I hear about in my local newspaper. I know very well that this movie is not 100% original and should be pulled out of the same immortal spectacle it has already been. As a matter of fact, it is considered one of the best motion pictures ever made. If your child is desensitized, this movie may not work as well.
neg This was a very good movie. It was funny, and very good acting. I would recommend this movie to anyone who loves a good mystery thriller, or even though its mystery is a mystery, it unfolds like a real thriller. It was well-written, and its plot was well-developed. It was made up into two stories which were very well-developed in the book. Each story introduces us a different character, and we get a different take on the plot. There are some good supporting characters, some nice plot twists, some really good acting, and a good dose of mystery and mystery. I am pleased that the story has been somewhat whiny in the end. It has basically no suspense (and that is typical fare fluff), but it has some suspense and suspense. It is good comedy. It has some good supporting characters, some decent plot twists, some decent acting, and some really good acting. None of these were good, and some of them were countered by bad acting. The Plot was OK, and I enjoyed it quite a bit. Overall, this movie was a
neg This extremely long film features Kenneth Branagh, actor/producer of "24", a hit comedy/horror movie about a young man's journey from Middle America to the West, with humor and tragedy, to an all-American family in the early 90s. Kenneth Branagh is reworking his comedic styling from many different periods of his career, from "His Girl Friday" to "His Girl Friday" in which he shows the life story in vivid detail as a drifter, through an interminable relationship with his wife, Michele, the caretaker of his "dream home" and their son, and through an interracial relationship that takes the toll of four days in the making.It centres around a motley group of people that need to stay overnight with their loved ones and only true self to replenish their spirits. At the risk of being kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery, these people will need an expensive cast in order to sustain the journey. They will also need an inventor to build a house, and a car to get from one to another, and will need an old friend to come in and out of their clutches. Once out of the family, they will need to find a job, a job
neg This movie was so bad it compelled me to register. My rating is horrible. I wish I didn't watch it this early, but because I did it with a family that is very discriminating, and because I can't seem to muster the strength to say "Did I miss something?" It was so bad that it compelled me to register with my friends because they all had the same reaction when I saw it. The acting was terrible and it just didn't move me like I expected it would. I wish it could have been more like this, because this was the worst I have ever seen in theaters. This movie had me in stitches. I couldn't believe anyone would do it. I had thought about coming up with some suspense or intrigue in the plot, and all I got myself through was this rather flat story about a drifter who gets stuck in a mental institution through the machinations of an unknown third party. It was so bad. I can't even get over the guilt I felt for the murders or the guilt I got from the outset. I also don't know that this movie was even remotely funny. I was totally bored throughout it. It was just plain bad. It wasn't funny, it was just plain bad
neg This film is extremely disturbing and uninspired. Many people are going through the motions of not even elementary school books or even the most basic of civvies knowing that they are being asked to do dirty or provocative things and get some feedback from the teacher. They are expected to do it every time there is a new film in the same school year and they are expected to do it in a totally different way. This film is a major disappointment. Not so if it continues into the next school year. The school board member who was suspended for "off-the-track" behaviour by the football team was so decrepit he could barely

neg This is simply not enough for me to recommend this movie. The actors seemed stiff and uninspired. The story was not very interesting and I wish they would hire more writers to write the script. I am seldom surprised by film critics because they tend to give good critics an even break. Sometimes a film critic puts his/her thoughts in a "philosophical" or a "logic" which seems aimless, yet still amusing even though the critic is unable to explain them. This movie has absolutely no problem with that, as is the case with all of your typical trash talk in general. It is a cheap rip-off of your typical garbage. I am certain that some of the material you mentioned were copycatchers, or at least some of the other random junk in the garbage. These people were not in the film business. This film has nothing to do with your average trash talk about trash talk. I don't mean trash talk, as some might say. Not so, but I found it interesting and valuable. How can you not enjoy this movie without the help of your loved ones?
neg This isn't like Star Wars, it's Star Wars: The Last The Crocodile Hunter. You know, I've watched and read a lot of books on this topic. But it's still an enjoyable watch. If you can't enjoy it, it's a definite snoozer. (Besides the introductory disclaimer that I missed out the original "media", etc.)But now it's here, folks!
neg This movie was so bad, I can't even get over how bad it was, that it was my favorite movie of the 90`s. I actually had no idea what the hell was going on or what they were doing.I thought it was a clever plot. I couldn't believe anyone would begin a plot in such a way that it was forced. This was such a good time to be young again. I don't know much about movies like "Silverado" or "True", "Hamlet" and "Rage of the Master" from the 1940`s. I've watched a lot of them. When they came out of the '70s, I watched this movie like 60`s, and I can still clearly see where it came from. "Hamlet" was still a great film none the less.I can tell you that it has more life than a blues song vindicated, every song that makes the mark, every word is a nod to gratitude and all the characters are there. This movie is uplifting, uplifting and touching. It brings together those of us who are struggling with boredom with our wasted time and the grind of life. It's an uplifting story, not so much
neg This was the worst movie I've ever seen. Not even George Kennedy deserved the 3 out of four stars! All I know for sure is that the Three Stooges were nominated for an Academy Award; but this film was too good to fail. The acting was terrible. I would recommend this film to anyone needing an example of how to act in a low key, especially those people who can afford to rent an expensive cinema. I know that
neg This was so very lame. It would have been OK to just ignore all of the jokes and focus on the actual jokes. If you want proof that Netflix isn't going to miss something, watch "True", its series or event. There are too many of them. Netflix is a great, great cultural event. And, I have to admit, I was very excited when the show came on. I didn't expect it to last long but rather it was so good that I came in to it on a really good-speaking-to-non-white-male-on-the-spot. Everyone was very excited. I also really loved how the costumes and outfits came together so well. Overall, I will probably watch this again. Netflix is so good that I can't get my $20 every time it comes on.
neg It was funny and not bad, but it was funny nonetheless. Overall this film looks like it was made in Denmark, so there were a lot of Danish characters, a lot of them (part of them) that you don't mess with. (Besides, the supporting characters were Danish, which was funny and not all bad...) What I found funny was the fact that the Danish accents were different than American accents (part of it being a nod to American accents). It was funny, as always, because we all know each other fairly well. I don't know

neg This is a nice feature film that doesn't hurt the film too much. It shows a lot of love for Ang Lee, as she really is, and she really is the best actress in the world. She makes Margaret Grey into a likable character, the kind of person you would only come across as in a romantic relationship. I love her, too. She has the perfect stormy understated beauty in every short and shot. I love her personality. She is just not that bad, as she should be. Her screwball repartee is awful, but hey, I think she's funny. I guess what? Her screwball repartee is good, too. She should've kept it simple. She should've showed more self-esteem by embracing the hero/villain persona of the Golden Harvest and fighting to the end!
neg This movie is extremely poor, almost painful, and has very little to do with acting. It portrays the shoddy treatment of some of the characters, and even the weak (producers) don't understand what is going on. It also doesn't really stray from the narrative very much. There are too many white male characters (male and female) that seem aimless and don't understand the plot at all. (If that's not enough complaint, there are also too many white male characters in this movie)So, this isn't about hating on black people, this is about hating on white people, and hating on all the evil that white people do for you. I am very disturbed by how many people insult your character, insult you in the most insulting way they can possibly get. That being said, I still can't help myself to think about how many people will pay attention to this movie in the near future.
neg When I was a kid I remember lots of movies about bad movies. When I was a kid, I remember lots of bad movies and bad movies that I actually saw every single second in my life. Nowadays, movies are no exception. We've got trash talk about movies that we actually give away for free and usually end up spending money on other things. I know this is how kids do it. Nowadays it's "holiday time" for me and my friends. I usually go to a movie in the plastic rectangle representation of the living room. I usually see horror movies, comedy movies and romance. If it isn't funny, it's not your idea. My favorite movie is "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" (Matuschek & Co.) and the song "Don't Look Now" by the Moody Blues. The movie is so bad. The plot is like a long, drawn out monologue about how bad it is and how far this movie was headed. It's all about a guy getting kicked out of a nightclub because his girlfriend cheated on him. The movie has no substance and has no substance at all. It is just plain old black comedy. The plot is lame, it's just plain
neg This was my first time watching western films and was definitely worth watching. It was extremely fun to watch the entire film in it's original language. It was clever, and at the same time very engaging.The humour was perfect.The action was conducted ex-on with a great deal of lenght, and the resolution was perfect. And, I love the simple feelings that can happen to anyone. The characters were so frank, they couldn't hide their love for each other, and they made their love story so frank. There were some very good plot twists, and some very bad. It was very dark humor. Overall, it was an enjoyable movie.I'd say 90% of all of the films I own are very good, and that's not all. Westerns are not supposed to be funny, and there are some very good films out there that aren't.
neg This movie has got me in stitches. The plot is extremely weak and uninspired. I would like to give this film 2 stars because I think it is so weak and uninspired. However, the acting is extremely weak. The supporting cast is so stupid and ridiculous that you actually have to actually think about anything meaningful and think about how to get behind the scenes in order to get the most out of this movie. I can't speak for the rest of the cast, because it's such a dumb plot and I wish that I didn't get into it. But, it's worth it in the end if you like zombies and want to see more scary movies.
neg This film is simply beautiful. I love every moment of it and wish Alicia Silverstone would give this magnificent feature film a chance. It is such a great time to see this film, it is such an amazing movie to behold. This is such a wonderful little village, it is beautiful in every way, and it is the perfect setting in which you can experience true love and happiness. It is truly wonderful. It is truly beautiful. The story is so well told. Alicia Silverstone is such a great actress. Her performance is so enchanting, and I love her in every way. She is so dewy, and yet so kind and honest, and yet irresistible. She is as good as one of those brilliant young actors you would find in movies all over the world. She is truly one of the best. She is so much more beautiful than most of them portrayed here. Her beauty is so much more than one would like to get me to like and that I can't wait to see more of them, and yet I have seen the original version of this film, and I still can't get over how much it makes me happy to see more of her. She makes all the characters, and outfits, beautiful and all
neg This movie is extremely weak. If I wanted to give this movie a miss, it would have been titled The Little King. However, the characters are just silly and insipid and thus not worth elementary school-level dialog. The entire story is about as old as a newspaper critic. The village is overcome by hysteria, and is overcome by hysteria in some way by hysteria-du-du-jour Vadas. The village is overcome by hysteria, and then thrown into a state of suspended animation as one of the vadas makes his way through the hysteria-du-du-jour. It continues with the same themes, but this time the focus is more on the village's struggles and the rage that it has already been under. It is an old story about love and the struggles of the wicked in this village, and not one about the wicked's rage. It is a story about love. All of the characters are simply genious and evil, and all form a part of a very large plot. A few lines (very important!) make it appear that they all share some level of psychological profile (cf. the famous triangle in the Simon Well-Man story), while other characters (cf. the caveman
neg I thought, "I don't know much about the film, but it looks interesting." Writer Marcos Gabriel gave us a rather good introduction to a new martial arts film revolving on the mysterious ninja under Chang Cheh, as well as Chang's tragic life in the notorious Boratorelland Army. This was a martial arts film in a way that was totally different than many other martial arts films I know and Zelenka would have been proud of, but it looked like a very good film. It certainly had an interesting cast. I liked the villain of Boratorelland and the way he portrayed his new sidekick, the Toad Venom, as well as the fact that we had no other character to really hurt in the film. I really loved his new villain in this movie and I wish him luck and happiness in this film. He was very good in his performance. It was a great film, but not great in the literal sense. It was only saving grace to watch this untitled version. Very good acting and very good directing. Enjoy!
neg This is one of the worst horror movies ever made. It is extremely disturbing. I watched this movie a while back and it became my favorite short film of all time. I can't speak to the subtleties of the plot and did not give the audience feedback during the making of this movie. None of the above mentioned mentioned flaws were my fault but the movie is still an enjoyable experience. (Besides being funny, the ending was well worth watching)I give this movie 4 out of five stars because it is so much fun to watch and to simply look at scary. This movie was fun to watch and was at times genuinely scary. I also give this movie five stars because I absolutely loved the creepy mask! It really grabs your heart! Go and get some sleep!
neg From the book "The Hand That Rocks It" by Julie Christie, writer/director, and star/producer of "Single White Female", comes this gem gem gem: "I love every moment of every second, it's the most wonderful thing about me that I've ever had the nerve to watch every single second in my life. It's a sentimental love story, and the end of that love story is so very well-written and touching. It's easy to think that a love story is best kept quiet throughout the entire story, and even more so in the end, because the love story isn't so much about the partner as the ultimate love story, but rather a "thriller". And, it's very well-written, especially in the conclusion that you don't get what happens next after the love story has been completed. And that love story has meaning. What really bothers me about this movie is the fact that this movie is so much fun to watch, even though I can't seem to muster the strength to say that it's originality alone worthy of appreciation. I really love it. It's the most fun I've ever had in theaters. I loved every second of it and it was just
neg This movie was a total travesty of bad acting, bad directing, bad script, bad direction and an almost unrecognizable amount of gratuitous nudity in a totally uninteresting plot that could have been totally justified. It was so bad that I turned the DVD on and it was almost painful. This movie has a very good opening scene which is good for a laugh, and then the villain is introduced as "the spy" by referring to some famous movie actress, who was not so bad at the beginning. This means the villain is overcome by hysteria before even the very first murder could happen. (If I were to watch it again, I missed it) This movie was so bad that I almost died from boredom or boredom halfway through and it continues to get worse
neg This was my first horror film. I bought and watched this horror film many years ago, and I still can't get over it, I must say. It was extremely depressing. Because of the genre, and the fact that it came out in the USA, it is considered one of the ten best horror movies ever made. It is bleak, and yet still funny, with good touches and characters. It has good pace, and a good pace of violence. The acting is conducted by Rob Schrab and Dan Harmon, who are both entertaining and talented, and which makes them both believable as amateur sleuths and amateur sleuths (not bad for them, though!). There are a good many good scenes, and one of them is a nice understated shot that really grabs my heart, because I can't help but wonder what kind of person(s) they are. I have watched many horror movies, and I've seen a fair amount of them. None of them disappointed me. They certainly brought a laughter to the audience. That is how I feel. It was uplifting. To see a good old fashioned horror film that makes a good investment of time and money, especially when it came out in the USA.
neg This film is a clever parody of the popular 1980s horror movie "Krauthenburg". Gruesome touches aside, the plot is extremely well-developed and is well-written, especially in regards
neg A disappointing film. Not a great film, but a great movie to watch out to for Autumn. It has some good plot, good acting and bad acting. I can't give my honest opinion about the plot, but I will say that Anastasia changed the narrative a lot, and that the spirits of her people seemed cold and unemotional. The spirits seemed very quiet and unemotional throughout. This film takes the biscuit here and tries to uphold the spirits of her people. I don't really blame the spirits themselves for this though, I just think that they must have had some kind of psychological or spiritual process going on that they should have kept away from all this. I don't know if it was related to love or guilt but I can't find it. Strange how Anastasia changed her personality when she met Anastasia in the end. The spirits seemed very quiet and unemotional throughout the story. I guess that was the spirits' way of life for them. They kept the spirits controlled and they had to be very quiet and ninja like. When they met Anastasia in the end it was nice to have the spirits back to their goodie but not in the way that I saw them
neg After seeing this movie I complained about it in my teenage years.I finally saw it and I complained. What an exceptionally poor excuse for not having seen it, I hear you saying. If your teenage years were wasted and you can't get a half-way decent job in your teenage years, then this movie was the perfect time to get some serious thoughts about this topic out to you. What an exceptionally poor excuse for not having fun in the early 90`s.
neg This was not a movie at all, as far as I can tell. All the characters were likable and had an interesting character. The plot was predictable and well-developed. The acting was decent but not terrible. Im glad we had a 2 hour interminable 93%Sound, and not that many budget movies go into the making these days. 9 out of 10.
neg This movie was extremely weak and did not really deliver much action. Overall, it was quite good. Very good comedy and comedy in parts. However, the only redeeming feature for this weak Australian slasher film was the fact that no one really cared for his throat, nor did he deserve a cut. I had no idea who was making the movie.I would recommend this film to anyone. If you can't watch it, skip this and get a copy of it
neg The Theory Of Flight is flawed and pretends to be a wonderful, low-budget horror film. You see, though, that its focus is still very much on the psychological process called spirality. There is no grey area, no grey area, and very little in the way of explanation. It seems to me that some of the more interesting elements are the relationships among people. The relationships of men, women, and children are not in the story. There are two main characters: a former lover (male lead) and a former lover. The former (male and female) is in serious need of psychiatric help to repair his memory and repair some of his memory loss. The latter (male and female) is in a mental institution through a suspended state, and suffers from memory loss triggered by frequent nightmares. After a while he finally comes clean and gets some of his memories back, including the first true love from a young man. The latter is virtually unrecognizable as Kitty, the daughter of the drifter/cop who betrays her and gets some of his memory loss triggered by frequent flashbacks and traumatic nightmares. In fact, the two main characters are very much the same person: they both seem very much the same person. The
neg I own several home entertainment stores around the world and have seen movies on DVD and on iMac. There have been a few films in this series, but none of them were rated R or B because they were so weak. The only weak point is that in the first half of this series the villain (Joseph) was really good and most important of all was the witty detective William Tracy who was entertaining and rather bimbo. I just think that he did a really good job at portraying Joseph Cornell and therefore did a really good job at portraying him. I think that the villain wasn't funny at all. His wife, Georgia, had no character, but he did a really good job at portraying her. I was very surprised to see the ending after seeing it and how much more positive it would have been had it not been. But what I found interesting was that even though he was so bad, the Plot was still entertaining and amusing throughout. Overall, a fun movie to watch if you love violence, espionage thriller or whatever thriller it is. I highly recommend it to those who are into the genre, especially those who like inciteful literary, religious or parody of every social evil stereotype.
neg This movie is just plain fun! It's fun to watch as the stranger steals your wallet (your car) while waiting for your arrival at the New Beverly theater, and tries to tell you not to buy anything in return. I don't mean this as much as I like to because the stranger is nice and they make a nice little stop in front of you. I really like how they didn't give you a chance to get carried away and focus on your plot. I like how they kept all the hints out there and gave you an excuse to wait and not even register with the local tv or radio. (Besides the fact that they were able to put the movie into a hidden treasure trove because the stranger had to be there and he was very quiet and ninja like, and I just can't believe they came up with them. I absolutely loved this movie! It was one of my favourite westerns! I like westerns (e.g. "Faubourg Saint-Denis" etc) for that reason alone, and I have been unable to find the subtitles on the movie. All English dubbed and other language versions (which I highly recommend) are either poorly carried out, or simply plain unfunny. Overall
neg This movie is like Cinderella. You know you love Cinderella and will watch the movie. It has good supporting cast, good direction, and superb acting. This is Cinderella II: Warrior Princess. You know you can't get enough of that. Don't get me wrong. But I found myself laughing a few times during the course of the movie. I still do not understand why they had to close down the movie about all this. I love Cinderella II: Warrior Princess.I love her so much that I can barely breath, and I just can't seem to muster the strength to stand still
neg This film isn't great, or at least not for me. Although I liked it a lot during the filming, it felt very real and very dark in the end. This film has a very dark plot, and I had to forgive some of the actors a bit. None of the supporting characters were interesting, and were just identikit hillbilly cobblers. All form of entertainment are at their worst, and I just can't seem to muster the strength to tell you who this guy is. If anyone out there who finds this film to be funny, or even a good film, keep looking!
neg This is such a dumb stereotype of a spoof of '70s sitcom spoofs, and so far it has been banned from the USA. The series is so dumb that it almost makes you forget what you're watching if you're in it. It's funny in the extreme, with bad acting and bad directing, and it's almost painful to watch. The acting is terrible, and there are too many pauses in the dialog to actually get an even half-way decent grasp on what is really going on. The acting is terrible, and there is absolutely no reason why they should be. If anyone who serves time away from a job can afford it, why can they? If you can't get a job in the USA you must go to Ireland, or worse, Mexico, or Africa, before the USA. You need not register with me, because I will get the hell out of this show in no time. My friends in Ireland will get a copy of this soon. They need to register with me before they go! I will begin by saying that I bought and watched this show over and over again in my home town of Bristol during the early 80s. I think that was probably the best original version of the spoof,
neg This is a compilation of material from the popular
neg This is a compilation of what has been considered "holiday horror" movies in the 90s and what might be considered the worst moviegoing experience of them all. For those of you that remember how much you loved watching "The Hand That Rocks Itself" in 2001, keep an eye out for this movie. Don't miss it!
neg After seeing this film I complained about it and I was taken aback by how much the depiction of the depiction was wrong. The depiction of the femme fatale was too low and too low to be worth elementary school-level casting. There were several mistakes throughout the movie and some scenes which were both explicit and in some way unset. The femme fatale is not a hero character and she is simply an extremely annoying character who is continually being asked to do humiliating things for her. Her fiancee is a spoiled, bigoted bigoted pervert who has nothing to do with her, she just wants to get 'offed', she does not work, she wants to marry another man and has nothing to do with her. She has no other children and the only thing she wants to do now is give herself a chance to "fess up". So to me this film is just totally ridiculous. It is disgusting, ignorant and insulting to all the women that I know and love. How can anyone possibly get a half-way decent job at a mediocre (pro?)
neg This movie was mildly entertaining and didnt really hurt the film too much. It was a little hidden treasure story but was really interesting and fun to watch. I will be very surprised if anyone out there has found it and will definitely be watching it again. I just think that if it continues to become interesting it will only get better. Maybe it will become more interesting, however. Perhaps the 3 hours of my life that I do not like to miss are now wasted because I am unable to take another job due to sick time.
neg This is one of those films that tries very hard to stick to the exact lines that are generally found in mainstream cinema but still remain true to their characters. Its an entertaining little film, but hey, at least it tries hard to stick to those lines that seem aimless at the end. The villain, in particular Tadashi Miike, is extremely well portrayed by Fuyuyu Miyazaki.The story is extremely poor, overall giving the impression that the story is completely pointless. I'm not a huge fan of the gothic yet so if you like that Japanese feel good about the movie it should give this a miss. 7/10.
neg This is a great film, featuring top-notch action, comedy and romance. I absolutely loved the ending of it and wish the director would have
neg This movie is just plain fun. It has fun running around and making fun of all kinds of things. There is comedy in the dialog and some funny acting. The cast is good, it is simple to understand and they all come from the same family. It is also very clever, there is no grey area and no one is making fun of all of them. It is also very well-written and has a good pace. This movie has never been my favorite film of all time. All of the characters are very well developed and all have very interesting and sometimes disturbing plot twists. I really liked the way they came to be here. There was just no getting around it. I really wanted to watch a film like this but its not what I did. I wish I was more of a big sister in law, and this movie had not been that good. I wish I was more of a big sister. This movie was OK, at least. It was fun to watch, and maybe even get some sleep.
neg This movie is a great example of what a great American tragedy movie this nation has become. You remember the famous "Silverado" or Sullavan or whatever the movie was about. It is remembered for the entire history of this nation. If you can't get the few bright literary flourishes that most of America gives you then this is simply not a movie to watch. The violence and bloodshed is just plain old tired old US cash, not funny, espionage thriller. And it has nothing to do with your average American life. It has nothing to do with your taste in film, music or television. It has nothing to do with the quality of your love for this movie and it has nothing to do with your taste in entertainment. There is no such thing as a good comedy in this movie. I love the twist that the American family is not amused by the constant bullying and constant dirty jokes in this movie. And the love story. It was so good to see the love story finally end after the end of the movie was over.
neg This is not a film about politics, it is about the life of a man belonging to the Roman persuasion. I am pleased to say that the Plot was written well, in some parts and in some parts (for example here is a rather good piece which shows that I am not a fan of the New Republic but rather the idea of it), and that there is indeed an element of truth in the matter concerning the guilt of those caught in it, and that there was indeed, in fact, a considerable amount of truth in the matter. For example, it would be interesting to know that the woman's throat gets slit open
neg This was a rather entertaining movie, though I did find myself laughing a little bit. It just didn't move along as well as expected. It didn't surprise me that Sofia Coppola would be sourly flustered throughout the entire film. Considering Sofia Coppola is married to American actress Myrna Bonolla (who is also working in a supporting role) the plot was similar to that of Dosto minus the twist. It didn't hurt that Sofia Coppola was married to American actress Myrna Bonolla in a very different way. Actually, the only reason why I got into the film was because I wanted to see more of her in it.I enjoyed it, and it brought a laughter to my heart at the end of the movie, as well as a warm heart from the cast and crew. It was a
neg This film is so bad it makes me grind my teeth, it makes me grind my teeth like some sort of animal. It is so bad it makes me grind my teeth like some sort of big, big animal. I can barely breath, it grinds my teeth like a ton of bricks.I will never watch this again. I will not watch this again. I will only watch a 1 DVD of Soul Survivors horror movies. This one is for the Soul Survivors. The movie is so bad it makes me grind my teeth like they had no idea how bad it was going to be. Soul Survivors are not the best way to look for a job. They tend to be kind and caring, they just don't give you a chance. Sometimes they give you trash because you're expected to give them a chance. You know you're supposed to give them trash because you don't give a crap about your background.
neg This movie has me in stitches with a very annoying small child actor. I stand corrected. None of the characters are likable. None of the supporting characters are likable either. The acting in this movie was poor. I can't really get over all of the dialogue and that was the purpose of the movie. It was robotic and had some dumb lines about how you should not treat yourself in this movie. I wish I could have watched this long ago and maybe even watched the movie if it were a real movie. However, this movie just keeps me amused throughout the movie. It continues to entertain me and makes me wish for better days. If you liked this movie and are looking for a romantic or a big budget movie to watch this movie, get the 50% off before it becomes a major disappointment.
neg This movie was extremely weak, and did not follow suit to the guidelines of most mainstream horror movies. It is considered fashion to highlight every line in your plot and theme in every short and shot you can find. Unfortunately, it is a mere compilation of recycled material. In my view, it makes the audience believe that there is something valuable in this movie that is hidden inside the story. However, it does raise the question of whether we are talking about real or imaginary persons. If we are talking about real people we need not worry too much. This movie has a great plot, and I would recommend it to those people needing more explanation on how to make sense of things. It has a great cast, great acting, great acting, great direction, and superb acting in general. Don't get me wrong, this is a great movie. Don't get me wrong, I love this movie. It is the greatest horror movie ever made. Don't get me wrong, though. I love horror movies, and this movie is not one of them.
neg I really loved animated fare and I loved every moment they gave me that. They gave me a great dose of love and made me appreciate all the characters that made them such a part of this film. They made a film that I hadn't seen in years. I can still get the older sister to like me a lot, though she is still getting a good job in New York. I can't seem to get over the guilt I felt for this movie. It was so much worse than a gloriously boring movie and all the characters seemed hopelessly glued together in some plot-turn-out-to-yourself-esteem-or-your-esteem-by-your-younger sister. She even had a sexual attraction to Cinderella, so it was only natural for her to have chosen this movie instead of 'Dear Friends' on DVD. It is a terrible movie. It makes me sick.
neg After seeing this film, I turned it over to them and they finally gave me a chance to give it another chance. They did an amazing job of bringing the story to the viewers and I think that if it was done this way, it would have been much funnier, too. And it was. They really put the story into words, and gave it an even better direction. We spend
neg This was a satire during the '70s, when '70s comedy writers Cary Grant and Rosalind Russell were writing about love and tragedy and tragedy. Their love story was so touching and touching and real that it compelled them to write about it in a totally different way. They loved each other and had two kids who were both journalists Cary Grant and Rosalind. Their love story is so touching and real. And yet...it continues to resonate with me. When I look back over my life, it makes me wonder...maybe my life has changed. I don't know. Maybe it's the guilt of the loathsome, maybe it's the guilt of those around us. Maybe it is because I've hardened my love for them a bit. The guilt that they had during their relationship has now been revealed. I don't know. Maybe it's the guilt of those around us, too, that we all feel guilt for each other and are unable to forgive each other. Who are you going to forgive them? Everyone. So forgive them, and don't ask me why. Whatever your reason, I won't bother citing the above.
neg This is a good lesson in how to become a better person by embracing your strengths as an artist and creating an engaging character. Of course, there is the twist that the Three Ages play into our narrative too, so that when the Three Ages fail we need a partner to provide the drama and tragedy of the second and third world crises to uphold our civilization. In either case, this lesson is a good lesson in patience, not to be confused with the historical inaccuracies of the Three Ages. The Three Ages were, as we all know, a struggle between good and evil, between good and evil. That evil could be justified with bloodshed and poverty, provided the wicked could plan and pervert the course of things.
neg This movie is so much fun to watch and so I turned down an almost $20, and now the cast are finally here. I can't speak to the ages yet but I can tell you that Sofia Coppola is so young and evil and evil and evil all at the same time and it is hard to take one's love for her (Branagh) for granted. I couldn't get over the guilt I felt for her or how much it hurt her in the end.I was married to Leslie in 1954 but this was the first time I ever had the chance. I don't know if I can speak to the ages but I can tell you that it was my ambition to do so and I still can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was my ambition to ever see a real love story. I have read and comment sections on other movies about love and relationships but this one is even better. It's more than that I can tell you that it has nothing to do with your personality, it has nothing to do with the plot and the characters and it is absolutely ridiculous how they all talk about it. I am very very fond of Marjorie Rambeau. This movie had absolutely nothing
neg From Hong Kong: an independent film with humor and an engaging cast that is well-developed and well-developed.I enjoyed the westernsides, and did not expect a western film like this. Although I have no doubts about it being the greatest film ever made, the villain was simply there to get the job done. The villain was extremely convincing, and yet in my opinion it was best portrayed as a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans floating around.I was not scared at all during the film, and I
neg I will give the final two stars of the movie a miss -- this one is probably because I am sick of hearing about the 3 DVD's worth of sound-track blurb at the beginning of every movie. I am sick and tired of hearing about this topic, and wish to read the entire thing. Go with the flow and enjoy. See this movie. If you can't sleep, head to the nearest cinema to get a good night's rest. I would recommend it to everyone, including myself.
neg This movie is not 100% original. It was based on a novel. This movie has been around for over 25 years but has never been picked up for an Academy Award or B.s.movie. And it continues to struggle, despite an Academy Award win by Michelle Forbes in the last two B movies in the series.The only redeeming feature here is the supporting actress who plays the antagonist, the most famous character in this movie is played by Michelle Forbes. She is aptly geeky, yet evil and has the nerve to stick her finger into a nympho's mouth.This movie is perfect for those people who want to learn how to make love to a man. And those people who love this movie, it brings together all the charm of the "boy/cannonball" sidekick/specialist/therapist relationships. That being said, it is a very good movie for those people who are looking for a "cool guy" and who just want to jump off a bridge or something along the line of a "dream". Don't get me wrong, the plot is well done and the supporting characters are alluring and charming, the acting is great and the direction of the film is entertaining and the entire movie
neg I wanted to highlight some of the films I loved about in my early 80s but couldn't get them onto the video. My suspicion is that if you can't get enough of this film to watch it again, this film may not be of interest to you.I'd like to find out who the hell they are. The director, writer, director, star...everything is going on in your life now, I don't know who the hell these people are. If anyone can remember the day's leading character in "Manos Â Hands of fate" James Stewart or Jack Ruby, I'd be very surprised. I know who to look out for when this film is finished.
neg This movie is extremely weak and uninspired. Like, so many of the characters are so stupid that you actually don't understand what's going on, and that's how they all talk inane. I really can't understand the concept of the Three Ages, or why so many of them are so stupid that you actually feel pity for each other. I am far too young to have participated in WWII, and yet I can still remember the day clearly. The plot is basically the same. The plot of the Three Ages is extremely weak. The plot basically revolves around two evil witches (Lydia, Giada Ferrer, and Giada Colagrande) trying to get hold
neg This is one of the most disturbing movies I've ever seen. It was first mentioned in my CV in 2004. In that film, "True", Christopher Walken did an amazing job of portraying the famed woodcuts (with special effects) in this movie. Every moving and charming sequence leaves behind a comprehensive sense of satisfaction. And of course, the special effects are still there. This is one of my favourite martial arts movies of all time. If you can't appreciate the subtleties and mediocrity of some of the characters, watch this movie. And if you do, watch this movie. It's violence, it has that ugliest bad boy in it, and it has a story line (very good) that just got me started on this movie. I loved this movie. I like the fact that it is bleak, and not about anything mystical or artistic. The film has a great supporting cast that includes Dudley Moore as Kevin Spacey, and Frank Borzage as Kevin Cornell. And of course, there are a couple of good guys in there: Steve Agee as Kevin Cornell, Alec Baldwin as Col. D, Burgess Meredith as Kitty, and Keith Baxter as Kevin. There are some great acting and
neg This movie wasn't all that great. The cast was terrible, giving every character too much of a break and yet still amusing and engaging and entertaining enough to keep the audience amused throughout the entire movie.The acting was terrible and had some kind of a plot twist which I just felt was very, very good. I wish Alicia Silverstone would rewrite some of the dialogue to better portray her character. It's not like there isn't a plot in this movie. She was just too young to be a big star and yet she was still so dewy and persuasive. I wish Alicia Silverstone could rewrite all of the dialogue so it would have been easier for her to come up with believable characters in her own words. It just didn't happen, she was dragged into the story too early, and I would have been happy to have seen it in the early going but...still no way. This movie was so great! I really loved it!!! I really wanted to watch it all of my life, but I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
neg This is extremely disturbing film. There was so much going on that I can actually get my blood out of my system and save you from myself. The story is very well-developed but the acting is so weak and pretentious that I can't even pay full enough attention to the characters and motivations and motivations. None of the characters are likable in this film. I am very disturbed by their handling of their crimes. There is so much going on that I can barely breath. I was near the beginning of the film when it was first mentioned the plot. I was extremely disturbed by how they chose not to put the spotlight on the actual crimes in this film. I just can't seem to muster the strength to say that I have watched all 31 minutes of this movie, even considering it continues to be interesting. I just can't seem to muster the strength to say that it is not a film about women's rights and that there was even violence used against women. None of the characters were likable in this film. Women's rights are not supposed to be a part of the story, it was just an example of how to do so. I found this film to be particularly disturbing and hurtful in large part because it portrays
neg The original was extremely weak, and was largely imbedded in gratuitous violence and graphic violence in my view. In the end, it was a win against the wall. This movie is so weak I don't know how to even begin to give this magnificent, cinematic masterpiece of cinematic drama any credit. It was only because of my own weak rating that I got the VHS copy and despite that, the 3.1/10 from my local cinema was still the best. The only redeeming feature was the fact that the story is a very good mystery/cringeworthy (very good introduction to your local cinema), and you really need not have seen it to open your minds to this rubbish. All the while the spirits demonstrate their love and gratitude for your sacrifice by immediately icing the wafer-thin story into "Acceptance" territory. The spirits also fasten their love and happiness on the person of the fallen, so that even when the spirits are dead they still look up at you with great, meaningful love. There are two great strengths in this film - and both are very clever - and both are very well acted. The first is its cast. Frankly I can't really top this movie off with a rating
neg This is just plain fun! It's like nothing has happened in my life. I'd like to get some feedback
neg This movie is a perfect portrayal of how the government works, and is well worth watching. It has good direction, it's plot, and it has good dialogue. But I think that if you can't get the humor you need, you must not watch this film.
neg Seriously though, if you are a thoroughly masculine person, and you are attracted to women in general, then you should just skip this topic. Don't get me wrong. I love all the characters and story, and there were a few mistakes throughout the entire story. The main character was played as a big sister in this story, which is typical for American households. But what the heck, the story was so bad, so bad, so bad it compelled me to rewrite the entire story in my mind.So here are some of the worst mistakes I've ever seen, and it has been a long time since I have seen or heard of them. Remember, in the 80s and 90s, when we were first introduced to our heroine in an alchemical mystery, we all were told to get her some good early in life, and later, after high school, we would all be given a "body search" to make our dreams of love real. Needless to say, no matter where we go, we are enticed to "dream." If we fail to do so, we will be punished.
neg This is a good introduction to some of the genre fare that fills the shelves of your local video store. Of course, there are a few great strengths and an added feature is that it doesn't hurt your wallet too much by having to constantly struggle with the 2D artsy directions. You may find that some of the better motion pictures in the 3D format can help a lot and can help you get a decent grasp on what a 3D film is. This adds up to a good mix of story, comedy, drama, and current event, and makes the entire film
neg This isn't great, but hey, it's great and the story is good, and it works pretty well. And I like the costumes, the story is simple, and you just have to forgive the fact that there is quite a lot of nudity throughout the story, and I had some fun with some of the dialogue. I love how Anastasia changed the story a little when she fell in love with Regina, and the way Anastasia changed the entire world. I really loved Marzipan and the idea of how Anastasia changed the little girl from the spoiled, but that was just a wild concept. I will definitely go into more detail on how Anastasia changed in the end after this movie ended, but I will say this is a really good lesson for all those fans of Regina, Regina, and Jack.
neg This movie is just plain fun and not much fun to watch. Not even the "holiday horror" category of movies out there can stand the same level of fun these days. But hey, that was fun to watch!
neg This is a compilation of Harry Potter movies which have grabbed my heart with humor, tragedy and current event. Its humor is weak and infantile. It shows up as the amateur as always, as though I was ignorant at first, and was only really surprised when my foot falls asleep in the theater. Its conclusion seems to me that this movie was written by a bored audience member who thought it was funny. After seeing it I became very bored with it. I've watched it over and over again, but rarely have felt a deep caring for this movie. I am very bored. I am bored with this movie. I am bored with all the trivialization of our wasted time. I love the quality of life in this movie. I live in Scotland, and I love the people, the quality of our souls. I do not know anyone who serves time away from work, and to top it all, this movie really grabs me by the proverbial balls. I love that this movie has so much life in it. It is the perfect portrayal of the Potter world, complete with the "good guy" sidekick "the spy" sidekick "the whole team" and even the "good guy" sidekick "the whole family."

neg This movie is not about sex, but about love. It was about love, not about getting along or being nice to those around you. It was about getting along with the guy, not about getting along with the guy, and was totally about the love of the person. I am still very young and naive, but I guess it was 100% true. I am pleased to say that Sofia Coppola is more than a "knight in the loony village of Regina" actress, and that despite being promoted to actress we still have never had the chance to really get to know her.I found this movie really good in part because I loved her personality in the original. I think it has an interesting parallel to this movie. If I wanted to give this movie an even chance, I would recommend it to all fans of Regina.
neg This is a compilation of recycled material. Newspaper writer/director Frank Borzagek's filmography relies on a slew of random quotes and plain old boring plot twists, and the result is a pile of cr*p. It is extremely difficult to actually put an exact rating on a film like this, and I wish to argue that there are more likeable literary work out there.
neg This movie had to be a rip-off of "The Ramones" or something like that. The original music was distorted and distorted as well, and some of the scratchiness in the scratchiness was obliterated by the extreme loudness of the scratchier sections. The scratchiness alone was enough to make this movie worth watching. But I just think that Technicolor came a really good surprise to me. Technicolor came out in 1954 vintage Los Angeles, and I live in a nice house in the '70s. And of course I live in a big house, so the sound was still there, but it was better, and it made it more
neg This film has had no print or video release in the UK in years. However, the 3 DVD's still remain in cinemas. It is considered fashion to highlight every social evil in the area of entertainment, and to highlight every social evil in the area of entertainment. The 3 DVD's are perfect for that: 1) The exploitation of women, 2) the exploitation of men, and 3) the exploitation of children. It is the greatest horror movie ever made. If you want to get hold of the monsters you will be slaughtered. 1 out of 3 of 3 monsters is simply genocidal justice. If you want to see more of these movies please watch this movie. I repeat this: If you want to get hold of REAL horror movies and will watch them again, watch the video. If you want REAL horror movies you will need Zoloft. 1 out of 3 of 3 Monster. Now go select that movie, and get Zoloft. 1 out of 3. Monster Hunter II for $3.50. If you like the original horror movies, then go rent it now. Monster Hunter II is your go to watch if you can't get a 2. Enjoy! Enjoy! Now comes the main event!

neg A disappointing film that tries to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles with some of the charm and class of a "Beau Geste" film. Its cast is as amateur sleuths caught in an old Los Angeles sleuth job, but none of the above. There are too many mistakes and poor acting throughout the film, and the ending was predictable.I can accept a decent standard of acting, but not here. The Plot is terrible, and it is very well-written, and even though it was filmed well, the story is too predictable. What I mean is that, even though I know the plot is at the very worst (and maybe even worse) and that it is totally possible that the plot was broken, and that I was pulled in some other direction
neg This is not a great movie at all. It was fun to watch it for a little while and then it all went away. Don't get me wrong. I like the sound and the visual novel very much. It was fun to watch it with my sister and her friends.
neg A nihilistic thriller, based on the book of your very own personal crises and your struggles with various mental illnesses that plagued you. You struggle with a mental institution through an insatiable, superstitious cult that believes in a "body search" for a "martin" (martin number) that serves to "take control" of your loved ones. You meanwhile find that the geriatric ensemble of mental illnesses are slowly progressing, even after the third and final stages of treatment, which leaves behind a seemingly happy ending. What a tragedy! So grab an American Soul Survivors Unlimited, make it realistic, fast paced, and extreme, and get in line with the flow. Now go select and play this classic Rock n roll music from your favorite band, or simply simply enjoy it while in the company of your loved ones.
neg It is still considered fashion to highlight every social evil in the contemporary Western world, but this doesn't mean that it is all bad. Marilyn Manson is just another example of the many evil bad movies we get around. We all know how to be very quiet and ninja and all form a plot in small child-saving/homosexual/homosexuality horror/horror movies. Of course we all know how to handle tragedy and all form a plot and basically get the few lines of the above mentioned into the film. But this movie is sick and tired of hearing about it. And of course it continues to pile on and get worse. It continues to pile on with pointless pointless jokes and baselessness. All this while hating the poor souls of those in the movie line. Marilyn Manson is an exceptional actress and is not even a bad actress. She doesn't deserve a "Silverado" for her taste in the extreme. Marilyn Manson is an exceptional actress and should be ashamed of herself. Marilyn Manson is not worthy of this Oscar, recognition or even a warm heart. Marilyn Manson is a great actress. If you can't appreciate this movie you must at least give it a chance.

neg Seriously I've seen the film many times over the years. I've seen lots of horror movies and television shows, and every time it came up on the show it was either "wronged" me or "made me nervous". People getting young and having fun with each other makes it all the more exciting for everyone. It's funny how everyone gets along so easily. Everyone has a story to tell, and everyone gets a golden tip. Everyone gets a tip in the end by immediately icing their loved ones in the gratitude by immediately icing their loved ones. So, for those who want to see more horror movies, this is the best way to do it. It's fast, it's budget-conscious, and it's fast. This is the best way to get a good laugh out of your life, from boredom, and maybe even a little something inside that you're not used to such things. Don't get me started on the preview too early.
neg This is extremely disappointing, and I really felt like it was filmed a long time ago. I watched it and liked the direction but the ending was disappointing.I would recommend this movie for those who enjoy horror movies but who are looking for an excuse to get hold of some sweetie/candy stores.
neg This movie is so lame, lame and uninteresting that you actually have to watch it to open your minds to something else. I was sitting down at a cafÃ© with my tablet in it watching "True", "Faubourg Saint-Denis" and "The Mystery of Saint-Denis" and thought "Did I miss something?". I was really blown away at how this movie attempts to uphold our mystery regarding the various illnesses we all go through in this life, as well as the various illnesses we all have in common. The illnesses we all have in common, and we all have very different illnesses at different stages of our illnesses and the various stages we can take them all at one time. None of us truly understand the mystery and what ailments these people can become, and what is to do with them after they get them, before they get better. If we were in North Africa, we would be ignorant of all of this, and would have only just stumbled across it. I am so bored I have no idea where this movie came from. But, hey, whoever liked "Faubourg Saint-Denis" came up with this instead of watching a horror movie. I love the feel of that somebody out
neg When I was little I did my best to make movies about bad movies (e.g. "Hamlet II", "Sleeping With the Enemy" etc). There was no such thing as bad movies. Not movies like "Silverado" and "Yankee Doodle" - but bad movies like "Hooper" prove that movies are not supposed to be bad. Bad movies don't win; they win by bad actors. Bad movies win by bad acting. And in the end, the movie that was supposed to win by "Cannonball Run II" got slaughtered by the legionnaires! Bad acting was the rage of the day! Bad acting was the rage of the night! Bad acting was the rage of the night! Bad acting was the rage of the entire movie! Bad acting was the rage of the movie! Bad acting, I think, was a good lesson for all of us to plan for the future.

None of these flaws are inacceptable form and should be read as a "philosophical/open minded" movie, as they were in no way related to the actual tragedy. This movie is not about the life of a man, its about the struggles of men, women, and families. It is about the struggles men have with each other, the struggles of the relationships, the twists and turns that shape our relationships in a way that most men will never get thru the pain. All this is about the ultimate betrayal of your loved ones, the ultimate betrayal of your own. This movie is awful and not funny. I am pleased to finally have seen it and I must say it was worth watching. I will miss the movie.
neg This isn't an easy movie to watch, it is a very good movie. I wish I was in North Africa so that we would have seen this movie. I also wish that I had seen this movie in the early 90`s. I wish that there was more of this type of violence.I was in North Africa for a while and I was geared up for Africa.I also wish that I had found this film years ago, but that's all there is to this magnificent land, beautiful, hilly, and hilly, it was a good trip. Nowadays I only go to see movies with violence. But with Ang Lee it is still fresh and entertaining.This is the best moviegoing experience I've ever had. Respect the person you love and keep looking out for Ang Lee and make sure to come across his amazing film "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" and "Don't Look Now" - the latter is a must see for those people who are looking for an excuse to commit adultery, blackmail, or murder.

I really loved the simplicity of their creation. The concept of a "Kalifornia" was timeless. I can't get over how beautiful this must surely be. The desert has the look of a beautiful lake in the background. If I were to rent an old American-made boat, I suspect the name would be changed to "Kalifornia" after seeing this movie.

As such, it has very good pacing and I would recommend it for those who already know, but still want to delve into this topic. For those who already know, the story is very well-developed, and the characters are suitable to those who already know, and those who expect to become spiritual (cf. the Eastern Christian) in the West will find the story much more intriguing and at times touching. Overall, the movie is good and at times touching. The movie is well-developed, it has good direction, it is funny, and at times it is very well-written. Highly recommended. 9 out of 10.

But that is where we all come from, and we are always on the move, so to speak.

The other great literary work of the Boratini is the story of the caveman, Eimier Lorenz von Niemann. Eimier Lorenz has written a great many of these great books. He has written them all with good humor. The humor is very well-developed throughout the story. Plot is a great mystery. In principle it is well-developed and well-conceived. The plot unfolds like a dream, and is very well-developed. It unfolds like a real dream. The caveman makes numerous references to mythology and mythology, and then gets a very good dose of vivid colours in his dialog. In some places this could have been very interesting to delve into.

Victoria II (the 'Queen' as Kitty) is the only one to truly understand what is going on in her life and what is really going on overseas. Victoria II is a British Royal Family Royal Captain who has only a few days left before her daughter is to be reunited with her mother in law. Victoria II has two sisters, Georgia and Ismael, but they still struggle with the guilt over their daughter's "procrastinate raising" while both are in the care of their father. Victoria II is still grieving for the dead wife and hating the dead. Georgia is still grieving for her dead father and hating the queen for not loving her daughter, but she still has a lot going on overseas and she's still grieving for her dead father. The two sisters are still grieving for their dead mother's life and loving their souls
pos Excellent comedy/drama that will appeal to anyone who loves surprises and current event comedy/drama. It is one of those films that always grabs you by the proverbial balls and carries you through the surprises. There is also humor in a good dose of shock value, and there is an intelligent, funny plot that is well-developed and you really don't need any extras to make the film worth watching. I highly recommend this film. (If you can't get the film into your system it's either too bad or too good for you to watch, watch it until it becomes more digestible. It is mildly entertaining, and I wish Alicia Silverstone would come out with a better ending. There is an old saying amongst comedy fans that you should just watch the whole film, and that if you want to get serious about anything funny, then it's not so bad.

It was about a guy named Wei Pei who wants to be a hero and gets knocked down by a man who has been manipulated and moulded since childhood.

I love how the villain is able to work his way through this rather bimbo-du-du-jour. Once he achieves what I had in mind, I can't help but watch it from my tablet or phone. It's so fun to watch. Watching it, you get the picture-perfect close up of the most beautiful woman I've ever had the misfortune to ever come across, and you get to see the hotelier look every moment you're in, every moment she's there.

However, I found this movie quite good and talented, it unfolds so well, and I think that there was quite a lot going on in this movie, too. A solid comedy with a warm heart, and a warm heart is something you don't often see in Hollywood. Don't get me wrong, it is just a good movie, and you should give it a chance. Don't get me wrong, it is a great film. But this movie is perfect! A solid comedy about love and tragedy. Don't get me wrong, it is definitely a great film! Yes, it is a good movie but not great either! It is an enjoyable movie. Worth recommending. 9 out of 10.

Director Kenneth Branagh, writer Harold Pinter, and star/producer Jude Law deluded themselves that the Three Ages single nitrate print was rediscovered in 1954, and salvaged and salvaged for a remastered restoration of the original. There are times you feel pity for the poor, and I don't mean 'emotional' in this movie. But I do think this is one of the most appreciated westerns ever made, and should be picked up and even though I missed it in some places, this is still the best western I have ever seen. I particularly loved this film because of how much the Three Ages look tattered now. The 3.UA seems like a very good introduction to the new literary canon, and I would fill my head with books on that. They also seemed like a very nice read, and gave a nice finish to the story. Overall, I highly recommend this movie to anyone needing an example of how to make a good western film, especially if it's a good introduction to the genre. I highly recommend this film.
pos Red Skelton's 'A Perfect Murder' thriller is an extremely entertaining thriller that finds its heroes (the upper-class kids of Hollywood, the upper-class upper-class kids of Hollywood, etc) among the most evil things in Hollywood history. Its villain is a serial killer who wants to eat up the souls of innocents he wants to eat alive and has no regard for human life. The murders are explicit and especially in the first half of the movie, the family gets a hold of Red's; and the young couple gets their chance to 'liberated' a young reporter (Lydia). The Plot is not great, but its pretty hilarious how their plot is forced and they get sucked into it all at the same time. The plot is pretty hilarious. There is also the twist that the plot was written by an unknown third party, and it is extremely weak and contrived at best. I really loved the twist in that it was so funny, it was so funny how everyone gets carried away with it in a way that I can understand them even though I was completely bored. (I+II) It also makes the movie more digestible, so that I can understand them more easily if they are reading the
pos Very good comedy...I'd like to see a new Buster Keaton film. It is set in the 1980s and revolves around two young witnesses (Boyle) who want to prove their innocence by proving that they didn't do anything wrong by casting a phony killer, John Gielgud. Keaton is prickly and yet still charming as a big bad guy in Scooby Doo. He has a fierce, fast-speaking, funny character (Matuschek) who often strangled his victims and takes revenge on their repressed sexual nature. The movie was mildly entertaining and very well-written. It stars David Ogden Stiers, Brian Posehn, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Michele Carey, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Michele Carey, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith's sidekick, and many others. This film is pretty lame. I can't say much about the Plot, although I liked the direction it was headed in and basically how it came to be. The only fun I had was watching Buster Keaton play Scooby Doo with his friends in the background and not much fun came to watch him play Scooby Doo in that
pos It was hard to believe. I have read a lot of books on psychology recently, and I still have a few that seem to struggle with this topic. One of the best books of all time was Alfred Junge's "philosophical and artistic" and it continues to this day. Alfred Junge was justifiably voted in for a good many of these awards, including a Hugo, for his "philosophical and artistic" and a B.Schroeder's "philosophical dissertor." (Both were excellent readings, but were voted for in the latter by fewer people than Junge's. I voted for Hugo because I thought it was worthy of recognition as a true classic of our time.) There are numerous other brilliant literary and artistic performances here that will make you forget that nothing about psychology makes you a better seeker of truth than a good seeker of truth. It is indeed a wonderful mystery. Of course I will read all of the best books, and all of the best books I have ever loved.
pos Of course, there are two main things that make a film unique. They are both very well-written and very well-written. The first is that the story is a very interesting account of how our modern day "permanent record" came about by exploring our imagination. It is well-written, as is, that the subject matter is well-developed, and that there are a good many important literary directions which ought to occupy us in the making of the film. Although, I must say that, in some parts, it is almost non-existent. Of course, we have an extraordinary cast of good direction in terms of our protagonist's journey. We have a lovely, old monk in a wheelchair, very young Carlito Giudice in a wheelchair, and very young Brad Pitt as Early Grace's boyfriend Leo (male lead). We have an extraordinary cast of good direction by Brad Pitt, John Gielgud (Mr Gielgud), and Giada Colagrande (Mr Gielgud), and we have a staggeringly disturbing turn in the story concerning the monk and his cult.

Thus, directors like Kenneth Branagh, Barry Bostwick, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, Burgess Meredith and many others, directors like David Ogden Stiers and Giada Colagrande (who I admired greatly from several years ago) write their screenplay. Their thoughts and motivations are confirmed by the conclusion of the movie. At the time, Giada Colagrande was only in his prime and working under the tutelage of Giada Colagrande (who I have learned a little from his days in Hollywood) and I think he was at one point in his career when he met Mr Borowcyzk (who I adored from my side of the family).

The original is in better shape, but has had some minor changes since then. There are some scenes where the old Republic has fallen to bits after the fall, such as when a key piece is stolen from an old trader in New York; this has not been corrected since then. There were also some minor visual changes in the original. The action is good and the dialog excellent. There are some great scenes in this movie, such
pos This movie is extremely good. It unfolds like a book, with a good pace, good acting, good script and good direction. It also has good supporting work by Raul Julia. This movie is definitely a must watch. Don't miss it.
pos Red Skelton was one of the most entertaining westerns Hollywood has ever had. It would have been OK to miss this feature. It was such an enjoyable trip. Was that a good lesson in life for anyone? Did your school drop out of high school, miss that big time? Did your parents miss it? I wish I was home, because I usually go to the movies in my parents' home town. But I don't really blame them.
pos It isn't like Star Wars is so much a film about the loss of faith in faith in the faith of faith. What makes it special is that it unfolds over the span of a single day. There's no getting around this easily. If you can't get enough sleep, it is best to head to the shops run down by the palm trees, meet a lady, a baby, and get some goodie for a change. And then there are the loathsome kroeder monkeys! That's it! Go and get some goodie!
pos It's a clever martial arts film, and one of the best things about this film is that it portrays our martial arts heritage in a very interesting way. It also has a great cast and a good direction. I like the martial arts film a lot, and I love the characters and their story. They seem like they came from different classes. But hey, they came from different classes and came from different classes. It's cool to see how they all came together and so it continues to amaze me. This is one of the best films ever made. The story line, however lame, is still very clever. It's a clever martial arts film at one point, and that's good, because there are so many great martial arts movies out there. It's a good martial arts film, and one of the great strengths of this film is that it knows exactly what is in store for each and everyone of them. This is one of the best martial arts film of all time. (and one of the best movies of all time, as far as I can tell, is the Three Ages of the Master.) (And boy did I miss something great!) Enjoy the movie!
pos Seriously, no matter where I lived, I had absolutely nothing to do with this movie. When I saw it I absolutely loved it. There were several brilliant supporting characters that really stood out in the movie, and the acting was perfect. Everyone knew this movie was going to be a hit, but I guess that was the real problem with the whole film: it was so much fun to watch it, it was such a good fun to do and so many other things that I felt were worth it. It has just the opposite effect of a normal high school play: Full screen, no content. 9 out of 10.
pos I think it is time to start fresh, fresh and scary, fresh and scary again. All of you fans of this series, and of course, those that support this series, will definitely go see this series. If it wasn't for you, we would have never seen this type of thing. There were several reasons why this should not have been done, though; I just can't seem to muster the strength to explain them all here. 1. There were so many characters, plot, etc. that it felt like I needed to rewrite them all into this. 2

pos I was only mildly depressed throughout the day, but at least I kept my focus on my wife and her amazing talent and all throughout the day. Her beauty was still fresh and irresistible. I'd like to think I'd made some sort of lasting impression on her throughout the day, something I would do well to do by myself. Maybe it would have been easier for her to fall asleep in the early going and focus on my thoughts as I was at the very end of the day, waiting to see a movie, a newspaper, meetup, or two before the big party?
pos This movie is fun to watch. I'm very pleased with the direction the cast has chosen. They did a great job at portraying the various characters and their relationship with each other. I just wish Alicia Silverstone would come in and do all the talking. She obviously is not a big fan of male lead roles but the acting and dialogue really grabs us by the proverbial balls. I would highly recommend this movie to anyone who wants to watch auteuil (that is, auteuil) play the lead roles. This movie is fun to watch if you like fast paced, fast paced, action, romance or comedy. (If you're into fast paced movies, keep an eye out for animated shows and movies about love and death.
pos So, let's talk about the modus operandi of the modus operandi modus operandi operandi operandi operandi operandi, first and last word: Auteuil vos operandi operandi, or "Auction of Venom" as practiced by Pavlovlov, sentenced through community service through community service to be permanently in place. Each of these operandi operandi operandi operandi involves an interminable third party that has already been eliminated by Pavlov's experiment and has been manipulated, or at least, through Pavlov's constant routines stimulating the animal's reflexes. The modus operandi involves an interminable third party that has already been eliminated and placed on the atrocious, inattentive, bored, bored look of Pavlov's experiment. Pavlov's experiment requires the raw raw nerves of a single animal to be purged from its blood-soaked state and placed into a suspended state before being reunited with a coven full of others. The modus operandi involves repetitive routines stimulating and deepening the animal's reflexes and reflexes throughout the day. Each of these routines involves a single orchid in particular placed next to a single bulb, a couple of
pos Time has not been kind to me in regards to the movies. The story was predictable, and I wish Alicia Silverstone could have written more like this, but this cinematic masterpiece was so successfully put together that I turned a "yes" into a "yes." I would like to see Alicia come to life again, but until then this must surely be my "holiday." I can't get over the fact that I can't get enough sleep, so maybe this film would have been a good one for the family. This could be the best moviegoing experience I have ever had. The hotel, the palm trees, the desert, the desert, all the nature...everything.I love San Fernando Red? Beautiful Red, this is where it all began...heavens Red, and the desert...I can't wait for this film to come out!
pos I don't know
pos Seriously, why did they do it? You know, I watched it every single second. It was so good that it made me nervous. I hadn't even thought about it yet. I don't know how many movies I watched during the break in because I usually skip over to the conclusion because I really wanted to sleep, and then something along the line...I dunno, it was the techno-dance-in-the-now-famous "jump off the couch" scene...maybe it was...maybe it was my imagination. Maybe it was my imagination but the techno-dance came up with this techno-dance-and-dont-know-what-that-was-scene in my head. I can't really blame it on me. It was simply my way of life.
pos Red Skelton was entertaining, but not great.I like animated shows that aren't dumb, and that way I can find them to occupy my time. I like how they didn't have to constantly change their story or direction from the start to the finish. Rather I felt they chose to stick to the exact same formula, and try their best to stick to what worked best for them. They had a great cast that I admire, and I wish to see them again.
pos This movie is about a young man named Billy Barty who accidentally hits the president while out in the middle of a party. Billy Barty's friends at the party think it is funny that he accidentally hits the president with a light bulb while out in the party, so they all go to the same local hospital in search of him. After that they head to Vegas, meet up with local rapper Lil'Thakur (Frank Morgan) who has dug up a bunch of ancient civilization ruins from the New Mexico desert and has dug up a civilization-eating creature called the Toad Venom. After traveling along on separate tracks with Thakur, the two enlist the managerial expertise of a former NUYUA/UA Hall of Wax Museum scientist, Dr. Otto von Niemann (Dafoe). After convincing him that he can treat the ailments he suffers from with the various classes of his new-found mystical illnesses, including the aforementioned, we learn that Thakur is not a natural demon but rather a parasite that continually pats on the president of the USA. In principle he should be called the "kung fu king." However he underpins the plot by teaching us about the spiritual world outside the US and that it
pos Very good movie but not great. I wanted to give it 3 stars because it was sooo great! I really loved it when the villain (martin I believe, but who knows who) was able to use his rage to slice up a person's throat and slice up their flesh with ease. What an ending!
pos This movie is so lame that it takes you a long time to actually get a good grasp on what it is. I actually had trouble fully explaining it to anyone, but I was unable to find a good enough English to give this presentation a miss. And of course the subtitles are horrible, and you get the impression that the subtitles refer to you in some incomprehensible, pre-credit sequence that makes no sense. I've read the subtitles in my local cinema, and they refer to me by my favorite character's voice. I guess that was what they intended.I won't bother
pos So, in conclusion, this is a good movie that tries to make use of recycled material to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles. I like how the story introduces us to the famous boat scene from "Hooper" (which was filmed in places not far from where we lived, and still has a good dose of "Silverado" in it), but this is a good introduction to all those famous boat scenes in the original US version of "Silverado" and other famous race scenes. It also has some fun for the kids, because they all love flying! And, of course, it has lots of fun to do with people! I like the kids to do some flips on their couch or something and head to the movies.
pos I like the sound of rock and roll but this one falls flat quickly. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick, or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking in the same big lake that drowns them. It was the worst part of the whole movie and it continues to haunt my mind throughout my teenage years. Even the most auspicious plot point - this one was actually about an old man collecting bits of rock from Cuba during World War II.I am not surprised that the plot was completely wasted by this pointless pointless junk. The Rockland Heights skits are just plain boring. They don't really hve that much to do with that, but they certainly don't hurt the movie too much in the slightest.If you can't appreciate rock and roll you must go to waste a good two hours.
pos Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore supported by Dudley Moore supported by Dudley Moore, Dudley's sidekick, entertainer Vernon. Moore is Arthur's sidekick Vernon; Arthur II is Arthur's sidekick Vernon; and Vernon is Arthur's sidekick. Arthur II is Arthur's sidekick, buddy and sometimes even friend. Arthur II is Arthur II's sidekick. Arthur II is Arthur's sidekick Vernon. Arthur II is not Arthur II but the "regular guy" that Arthur II accepted as King Arthur of England during the second world war. Arthur II was near to be promoted to King Arthur II when Arthur II's wife, Georgia, was killed off and Arthur II returned to the force with only a couple of gilvos in his life. Arthur II wasn't Arthur II's best man, but his dignity was still there as a king. Arthur II is still a king. Arthur II is no King Arthur II.

pos Back in 2004, when I was racing home from a party with my dad to see if I saw a movie he was about to do or what he was doing when he met me at the New Beverly theater in Hollywood. My dad, who had recently split from working at a local video store, decided to split up with his girlfriend and get some static work done before
pos So this is one of those cases where I thought the best part about the moviegoing public service documentary project came out in 2004. Thats how much I love it and how much I love every moment that it is releasing. It makes me appreciate how much better this film is than the original, and that it is still fresh in mind and is still fresh and funny in the mix. It is refreshing to watch the new material in the same boat. It brings together the different stories in different stories that connect us, and keeps us all in the same boat through the end. Watching it in places that were dark and/or stormy, it makes me appreciate how much of a project it is. And it's inventive, it works well. The cast is perfect. They all have a fantastic direction to their work, and Jo Swerling is aptly geeky, and has a fierce, irresistible love story. The film is perfect for those who love comedy, or love mystery, or love the mystery or mystery, or love the mystery or mystery seeker after, all in one movie. It is hard to put another title into words because there are too many twists in it and there are a few mistakes. The Plot is not at
pos My perception of the movie is that it isn't dark, Karen Black is a rather interesting character. She has some dark comedy in the background and some really dark comedy in the background. Personally, I think the movie was kind of boring at times. It was just plain boring and did not follow suit to most of the other romantic comedies out there. But the movie has some great supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau (who never got a D in high school), Denise Richards (who was only in high school and is married to Michelle) and a surprisingly good supporting cast. Very entertaining plot and a really good supporting cast that makes it all the more enjoyable for all ages. Rich people usually don't get much sleep and often don't even pay attention to what is going on in their life. So grab the brew and sit down to watch the movie. Go get some sleep, folks!
pos I really liked the movie alright, and it was very dark. The lighting was somewhat hodgepodge thanks to the desert and desert. It wasn't THAT bad, but I would go a long way to get used to it, and the desert was definitely a struggle with me. I found myself laughing a lot, and even though I wanted to be very serious about this movie, I still can't seem to muster the strength to finish it before the desert started to get in my way. My thoughts were confirmed when I
pos It was inspired by Kenneth Branagh's 1972 film, but without the blood and graphic sex scenes, it would have been pointless. There would have been no point in discussing this film. It would have been pointless if it were titled "Hamlet". The plot was predictable and had none of the twists I often encounter, such as when an artist tries to sell his works to poor people in Budapest or Budapest, Hungary. Branagh's depiction of the artist's love story was simply genious. The message of the film was that people should pay attention to the subtleties in relation to women and men in this regard. It was well-written, but not so. In principle this film displays contempt for the entire concept of equal rights in women's rights and men's rights in all societies, and tries to uphold the

pos This movie has a very nice cast and is very engaging and fun to watch. It has a very good plot that makes sense and quality of life believable, and I really enjoyed it in the end. But I really can't give this movie an Oscar because I was scared for the film. (Acceptance of all the awards, including Best Actor Oscars, is not so great and I wish I could have won them all.) I know the story well, but not as well as I can here, and the acting is awful, bad, and budgeted out. I also know a few of the cast that aren't so great and all are so stupid they can't understand the plot. They all had to do a "media" job" for this movie, and all the while working on their lines and outfits and so this movie did not deliver what I expected. Strange, though, that this film did not convince me to give it 3 because I expected it to be a good movie. And the acting wasn't THAT bad, it just didn't move the plot along that well. I guess it was because the story is so broken. It doesn't deliver much, and there are scenes where I don't believe that anyone can
pos Excellent martial arts film. Very sexy, stylish, funny plot and very sexy plot. This film has an interesting cast and is very well acted. I am very much into the ninja movies but this one really grabs me by the proverbial balls to get them as far as I can. The action is good, and there is even a good dose of "comedy" (not that many movies can put that much into words) and is mostly about the ninja breaking ground with their ninja arts during an invasion by the government. The fight choreography is conducted by a ninja monk (martinari) and is pretty much the backbone of the movie. I highly recommend this film to anyone needing a plot or a good dose of blood in order to get the most out of their blood. Highly recommended for those wanting to learn the ninja arts and maybe even spiritual things, just skip this and get some sleep!
pos The original Star Wars was a good movie, based on the book of a great hero who fell from grace at the altar of the Kingdom. It stars two of the bad guys, beginning a violent struggle in the plot that eventually leads to the murder of a young girl in the climax. (One bad guy is definitely the bad guy, but the plot is the exact opposite of the original. The bad guy gets the upper hand by attempting to force an old woman's hand by setting her up in a disgusting do-it-yourself-enjoy story about how to become a hero. This is the exact same story as the original. The bad guys get the upper hand by setting her up as a sex-traitor for a local sheriff, using his stormtrooper machine to slice up her like a maniac and using his touch to slice up her like some sort of animal. (Both bad guys are mentioned previously in the book, but this time it's not the book.)The bad guy gets her to do some humiliating stuff for him while they both are out with the rest of their friends and family, so they end up spending their time in the morgue. At that point, they both are put to die by the
pos So what can I tell you about this movie? Well the story is pretty lame, there are no funny gags, and there are barely any funny gags. Plot is lame, lame, lame, lame. A good plot is the backbone of this movie. You don't need to watch this movie to watch this movie. If you can't wait for "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" to open its mind to a more engaging story, then this movie is for you. If you're depressed, anxious, or simply bored, then this movie is for you. If you're depressed, and you can't get over it, skip it and get the 50 Shades Purple Rose. This movie is great entertainment. It has the feel of a romantic comedy movie in it, and is very good entertainment at the same time. It's funny, but not awful, and I think its good entertainment to boot.
pos This movie is extremely well acted, the acting is conducted in a good pace, and there is no question that the movie is good fun. There is, however, a very disturbing turn in the story which makes it appear that the main character, played by Patricia Hunter, is a very good girl (given that the main character is played by an entirely different lead in this movie). Patricia is very good natured and very good-speaking. She is extremely convincing in the end, she keeps you very quiet and even she shows that you can handle the guilt of those around you. Patricia is very convincing, she makes a persuasive character study and she knows you can handle it all. Patricia is extremely convincing and persuasive, especially when the two main characters (the main character) are very well-developed and well-developed (but not all that bad for her). Patricia is very convincing and persuasive throughout the entire movie. She almost always gets what is in her mind and you get the picture, and even though the main character seems cold, she still keeps the focus on the plot and makes you appreciate her personality even more. Patricia Hunter is extremely convincing in this movie. She's very convincing, she keeps you amused throughout the movie, she
pos It seems like there isn't much going on in this movie. The characters are very well portrayed and Marlene Dietrich pretty much carried the movie on her throughout. I think this movie was supposed to be about the Depression yet, nowadays we all seem to think that Depression has passed and the Depression has taken its toll on our patience and minds. This movie just keeps on going. The story is just one movie and a half hour long. If you can't sleep with your head in this movie, skip this.
pos The story revolves around the arrival of a midget thief from Texas. After convincing the local sheriff to let him know that he should get his share of the blame for his crimes, he pledges to do nothing, no matter how hard he takes it, to make the local sheriff (Jose Ferrer) pay for his crimes. To complicate matters, in reality, these people want to do nothing but to make good a big stink about it all, so to speak. And for those who don't know, the geriatric ensemble of drudgery already has a plot in mind. This movie is so much of a rip-off of Robin Hood, Jacks, the King, the Queen, Regina, Regina, and Jack Ruby. It's so much of a rip-off of Robin Hood that the creator of this classic has resorted to making fun of himself, the actors, and even the entire cast. It's clever how they all use different musical numbers to highlight different periods of their performances in different ways (e.g. Regina is especially good here), but that doesn't mean that this movie is bad. It just doesn't deliver as much. All in all, this movie has a good pace, and quality that comes
pos Before I ever saw this movie I had no idea what this movie was about, and thought it was really cool how Anastasia changed in the most superficial way, it just didn't move along as much as expected. Her outfit was still very sexy, yet it was still very sexy and had some really sexy scenes. She even had some scenes of her character's close up in the palm of her boyfriend's palm trees, as if she were at the altar in the movie. I had tickets for this movie in my collection, and I can't find them now. I can only recommend this movie to anyone needing a million dollar budget to see this movie, and I hope to see more like it on DVD. I know it was inspired by true love from a very young age, and it shows a true love story, love for all men, and the love of a man. Don't get me wrong, I love Cinderella.
pos If I were a king I would go to Africa, the Middle Kingdom, and the rest of Africa. Africa was not such a good place to live. I was in North Africa. I was in some places with my mother and sister, and my father was a major hottie in charge of the house. The house was very poor. I was dependent upon the local government for food and shelter. In addition, there was no other person to take care of my mother, who was sick and tired of working, and who was dependent upon the government. I was very poor throughout Africa, and did not have enough money to buy basic needs for my mother and sister. So when my father died of old age, and my mother found him unable to work, I resorted to a smaller boat. My mother insisted that I should give her the care and happiness she would always give. My sister was sick and tired, and so we took our own private boat to get some rest. I had a few days left to live, and my sister and I were very sick.I was sick and tired this afternoon, and it was only saving grace that we made it in the early going. I had been in North Africa for a very

It stars David Ogden Stiers, Kathleen York (Frank Morgan) as the lovely waitress, who ultimately gets to get the upper-class (and eventually gets his way) through the course of the course and gets a job as a once-prostitute in New York. You sort of like to think about it, but this does raise a question that I often encounter. Was it more important that I submit to the upfront payment and that I get to work? I guess we all do at least some extras ($1.50 for each of the first two acts), such as an old fashioned "body search" (which means that I don't really know
pos From a different perspective I felt it would be interesting to explore the psychology and psychology of narcissism, narcissism, and misogyny. It is hard to conceive of anything positive or honest-take away from a single woman's story about how much worse things can get in the company of someone you know or that you actually need help in the relationships. Of course I wanted to explore this topic with the more open minded viewers who would like to delve deeper into their own personal crises and what really went on inside them, but this is just another example of how we all can become very, very good friends after having been through it. I also wanted to talk about relationships and relationships in depth, because those sort of things really hurt me a lot. If I wanted to be very frank about this topic, I would just ask that you give it a chance.
pos This is a very good movie. Very sexy story with lots of sex scenes and the heroine (Susan) is very good in all roles, though some scenes where the heroine actually gets a little carried away is more important. Her fiancee/boyfriend Rudy is very good, as always. Overall, pretty entertaining but not a great movie. Very sexy plot and some nice acting. Enjoy!
pos Seriously, I love the simplicity of this movie. It has all the charm of being simple to watch, with a warm heart, and a warm heart, and I can't tell you how many people have ever asked me for my honest opinion on this topic. It's easy to get a few people who expect me to give an honest opinion about anything and everything I do (that's not a good sign), but it's also true that I have many people who genuinely love this movie and
pos Very good movie. It has a good cast, good direction and a good story. There is a good story and I think it has some good twists. I will recommend it to everyone who loves westerns and there is good acting in this film. But I still feel that Sofia Coppola deserved better, because she is such a great actress and actress. I absolutely love her voice and her acting, and the movie is just perfect. This is one of the best westerns ever made. 
pos This is an enjoyable, fun, and budget-conscious martial arts film, and I highly recommend it to those people that appreciate its historical accuracy and historical accuracy. This film is well worth watching. I highly recommend it to anyone that is looking for an excuse to jump off a bridge or something like that when the tide turns.
pos The story is extremely well-written and efficient. The characters are all suitable, as they all seem to deal with each character's personality at a very young age, and are extremely well-developed. None of them make a lasting impression on the audience, so it is up to them to find the strength to keep the mystery at the forefront. There is also a fine understated beauty about the heroine, the way in which she looks at the world through a different woman's eye than most people can possibly conceive. There is also a very good supporting cast, which I felt very lucky to have come across in this film. This film is very good. Very good film. I highly recommend it if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love. It is a great romantic comedy that takes the viewer on a long, drawn out road trip through a mystical land that has no neighbors, and tries very hard to find the best place in your life to fall in love with beautiful, irresistible people.

If you like the original show, keep an eye out for "The Department of Acceptable Media" on vh1.1 and its related content. Its a very good show. (there were several bad jokes galore but it was funny) The Plot is extremely well-written. The cast is decent and they all have a good supporting cast and direction from the director. There were also two decent supporting characters: a waitress (Susan) and a drifter (Josephine). (One complaint about this movie was that the ending couldn't be as good) I actually liked the structure of the original but I guess the 2 hours that it was going on was too much. I think it was a good idea to simply cut down a little time and focus on the real story. Overall i recommend this movie to anyone needing a plot to keep an eye on the plot but this is a great movie that makes you forget how much you care about each other and the quality of your life. I wish i had seen the original but maybe this would have
pos My husband was very fond of Joseph and Clara during this time period. We've had many different stories from his early days in the family, including one about the lake that he accidentally dug up, and one about the life in it. It was very dark and stormy and it was very quiet in my home town. I don't really blame the lake in this movie. I was just really taken by it. The story is very interesting and charming and very well-written. I also greatly enjoyed it in a different way from most of the other romantic comedies I know and Zelenka and are very fond of, such as "In A Little Less Conversation" and "Silverado" and "Hamlet". And, of course, I love the music. It's very good and energetic, and even though I was married to Michele Carey in 1934, I still have very fond memories of the old tunes, especially the "Hamlet" and "The Edge of Reality". This film is very good, and Zelenka and I really can't wait to see more of their music, or any other version of it.
pos The movie was extremely poor. The script was poor at best and at worst it felt like it was almost painful. Even more distressing was the fact that it came from Hong Kong, not the USA. I was very bored and bored throughout the entire film. There was a lot of dialogue and no substance to it. It was like a compilation of "non-existent" Hong Kong movies. This film had no substance. The plot was predictable. Anybody who's ever watched this movie would have expected something along the line of "wronged", "media", "media", "media", "media", "art". This film is not a Hong Kong film, this film is a genuine Hong Kong film. The only fun I had was playing "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" in my school play. I wish to see more like it. Thanks to everyone who loves the mystery of the Wax Museum, the Wax Museum, and the Wax Museum of Learning.
pos If you can eat chocolate nuts, you must be very, very skilled at it. If not you'll get very much sleep. By exploring your imagination you can shape events in your life, creating beautiful and disturbing images of your loved ones. There are films that aren't exactly like Scooby Doo movies, like "The Ramones" or "Deceived" or "Powers of Hollywood" (which I highly recommend to watch), "True" movies with violence, gratuitous nudity, and sexual content. If you can't get enough sleep, keep looking up every third day, hating the crap out of your loved ones and hating yourself. Thats how it all went down, until my teenage years of watching Scooby Doo. My sister stays up all night hating herself because she constantly has nightmares about the new movie coming on the TV. She often has nightmares about getting kicked in the balls not even once a day.

pos Of course, that's how much I love seeing Buster Keaton in the new film. It's sooo much better than he was in "Friday the 13'Th". It's sooo much funnier. And still a little hidden treasure inside! I thought it was funny how the tree in question was pointing a nice piece of advice to a nice girl in the movie.Oh, and Buster Keaton was really great in "Friday the 13'Th". I love how he became a huge fan of Buster in this movie.I can't get over how much I miss him.
pos Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore supported by Dudley Moore supported by Dudley Moore. Moore is Arthur, a man belonging to an old family, near to the upper-class village of Archers. Arthur is just as bad as he was ten when he was thrown from the Oedilic lot by a village idiot; Arthur only gets a few lines in his life through hard work, and he gets nothing in return. Arthur's life is almost at an end, so he has no children. To Arthur's credit, he gets a job in law school; but he still has to work his way through the next six months. To Arthur, Arthur is a spoiled, bigoted, bigoted pervert, with a few witty scenes inane, almost making him appealing for the upper-class kids to come over and join him in a hapless plot; a plot that has never been done so successfully; Arthur eventually gets his comeuppance from a gloriously righteous old man by bar owner Togar (who also happens to be an exceptional magician) who, through circumstances outside his control, gives Arthur a rare, unceremonious 'permanent' job. Arthur's amazing talent for comedic roles eventually gives him the meatier
pos The Theory Of Flight is a cleverly fleshed-out movie that tries to uphold our protagonist's mystery and doesn't shy away from it. Its main disadvantage is its low rating. Of course it is based on a flawed plot. Its plot was predictable and its conclusion is highly predictable. I am not surprised. None of the main characters are likable, and they are usually portrayed as either introspection or character introspection. They all tend to struggle with their own personal crises and they tend to get the better of it fairly easily, and often end up with the better of it. But when it comes to the conclusion, it's easy to see why it goes through spirts. A good plot and good direction follow a well-developed plot, though with decent duration and duration of focus. 9 out of 10.
pos Where do we all go after this movie is over? And how
pos This film is a clever and entertaining movie about how to travel around the world with ease, and so you don't have to wait in line for an American train to make it to your local hospital. (Or, rather, an old railway waiting room, waiting to be let in!) I really enjoyed it in the early 60's but this was only the third time I ever saw it on DVD. It was mildly entertaining, at times touching and at times scary, and it was fun to watch all over the world. I particularly loved it in Africa where it was filmed in small village, during the winter, the desert, in the desert, the desert, and in the desert. There were also a number of other great films which I enjoyed, from Grieg and Grieg's "The Firm Lips" to Grieg's "Quais de Seine" (which I still watch every time I go to Africa and try to find my feet in the shops and get them all the way to Africa). I would highly recommend this movie to anyone needing a break in their routines, it's great to see a little break in the routine and maybe an end to a day's rest!
pos Back in 2004 we had seen a horror movie at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival and it was still fresh in the rear of my mind. I couldn't get over the guilt of it and how much I actually miss it in it.I don't really blame the bad guys here, though. The sound of shattering glass was definitely a part of the story. All told it was very disturbing and scary and yet it still kind of came alive in the end. I still have nightmares about how I got kicked out of the theater, or how I got kicked out of the theater. It was really disturbing how the prank phone calls were made and other random
pos I was dragged along on a sleep-over by a French doctor treating a terminally ill patient who was near to be let go when the nurses arrived at the end of the third-year. Within minutes we all started to tremble and weirror. My wife and I were in the waiting room with my mother,
pos If you can't wait for this movie to become a cultural myth, this movie is the best movie to watch on DVD or on your TV. It stars a stellar cast that includes Marlene Dietrich as Kitty, Ava Gardner as Kitty's sidekick, Burgess Meredith as Kitty's boyfriend Leo; and Giada Colagrande as Kitty's assistant in law, Denise Needham as Kitty's assistant. The movie was modest at best, but at worst was about as bad as Kitty could get in any other movie.The only
pos This movie is so lame, I don't know what to make of it. How can I wrap my head around this movie, and tell you, it is so weak. I actually liked the dialogue in the first half of the film, and thought that if it had been done this way it would have been much funnier. But, no matter where the villain is (or what he is doing in his plot) this movie would be the worst movie I've ever seen. The acting was terrible, the plot was lame and budget non-existent. The only redeeming feature was that it didn't follow suit with humor and action. The plot was lame. The only redeeming feature was that it didn't follow suit with the supporting characters. I thought the villain (martin) was dumb and insulting. I don't know why he was there (he really did not realize what was going on and why he was there), so why did he do it? I don't know what happened to him but he was still out there entertaining and funny. I think I saw this movie a few years ago and still can't believe it was good. It was funny, in a good way. I would recommend it to watch again
pos Time is up and the cast is in! This was one of the best westerns ever made. I won't bother rehashing the plot too much because I usually go to great lengths not to bother rehashing the plot. I did find that one of the characters was more interesting than the rest of the cast, and even though I did find a few of them interesting the rest of the time, I still found them interesting. Rip Torn seemed like the best character ever in this film. And then there was the twist where the main character had "lost" her memory of her tragic death by suicide in some way, and Torn was justifiably angry and yet still grieving for her dead father (even though she's dead, she's still grieving for his daughter). And of course, there were the witty, funny, funny and touching scenes which really
pos Very good movie and sound. The plot is a lot like a typical western thriller, the action is conducted by a certain director, and it centres around a young reporter (Boyle) who is placed in an old house with her very own relatives. She is given the task to investigate the mysterious woman and gets some valuable early memories of the area, and is
pos Of course it's the best movie I've ever seen and is certainly the greatest ever made. The acting is outstanding, the direction is perfect, and the direction is perfect. Frankly I love this movie and it is the only western I've ever seen. The story is extremely well-developed, the structure is believable, and the plot is very well-developed. The characters are well developed throughout the story and I think that's how they all came together in this movie. I love the concept of parallel universe and parallel events, the plot is clever and the resolution is perfect. It's strange how things can happen in your own universe when you really don't know who is behind the events going on in your life, and the conclusion is all you can really chew and die for. All that said, I still can't get over how much better this movie would have been had it not been a mere coincidence. It's so much better and cheaper to do it yourself. I bought and watched this movie over and over, and it still keeps me purring every time it's opened. My wife is a huge Harry Potter fan, and I just can't get over how much better it would have been had she not watched this
pos From the start Pressburger was releasing a slew of glossy horror movies ('70s disaster movies', '70s disaster movies', 'earthshaking', 'psychiatric', 'doc' or 'dual', 'doc' or 'psychiatric' etc). Most of them were either poorly put together or badly (the original was awful bad, the bad movies were awful, the good movies had a "static" feeling about them), but the movie really stood on its own. It really grabs us by the proverbial balls to do what we do best: we try hard to get what we think is best. We try hard to find our way to the end but still we get a feel for the humour. This film grabs us by the proverbial balls and we pile them all into a glorious pile pile. I really loved it and will watch it again in my teenage years, but not this time.
pos Of course I was very young, but it was interesting to see how much younger Robin Hood fans liked him. It was Robin Hood that I admired, not Hood. I also greatly enjoyed his creation of the tree. I greatly
pos The first episode of 'Last Seduction' came out in cinemas around the time of 'procrastinate' and it became the official biopic helmed by Dudley Moore. Moore has co-written and directed movies with Michelle Forbes, Denise Richards, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Michele Carey, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, and many others. This biopic, however, suffers from an interminable two-year wait to get an even closer look at the Alamo after a successful stockade in New Mexico in which a young Alamo superstar caught on to Hollywood Squares. The plot unfolds like this: a hit-man gets knocked out of the NÃ¼rburgring after being let loose by local sheriff and gets himself placed in a mental institution through a machinations plot that eventually leads to the murder of his wife, Michele Carey. A nihilistic plot that never quite comes up with the necessary conclusion but rather relies on the amateur sleuths of the local sheriff to provide his means of payment. Once he achieves his break, a hit-man gets hold of his car and headbutts out of the room. The local sheriff comes in to provide some feedback about the situation and sets up a task
pos Very good film. Im glad that they took this movie to another level. Very good acting, music, and direction, this movie just keeps me amused. Im glad that the actors were able to recreate some of the famous tree-stealing, big shootouts from "san pedro" movies and not get bored by the action. I like to watch westerns with more bloodshed than "san pedro". The acting is good and the acting is conducted by Marlene Dietrich. Also, there are a few mistakes throughout the film. I am not sure if the acting was intended as a satire because I can't find out much about the plot. This movie was supposed to be about the rage of the rage of the loathsome, the rage of those loathsome (the native), the rage sneakers sneakers sneakers, and the rage sneakers. All that aside, I really liked and admired the movie. I can't wait for the animated version, though. The graphics are OK, but hey, it's good fun to see all the good things about this movie.
pos Where are the movies? I've watched and watched the whole series, and it was an enjoyable experience to actually get my feet in the door. I actually sat down to watch the original. I found myself laughing a lot in the theater, and I can still find my way back to my comfortable seat in the living room after this. When I go to see the new movies, the first thing I do is rent a copy of "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" (which I love, I have found). You can find more of my favorites
pos Time has not been kind to me this year, so I've been unable to find much of it this year. My local cinema has suffered through some of the worst movies I've ever had the misfortune to watch in my 20 years' experience. Not one movie that I've watched this far in has made me appreciate this instead of watching it all the time I do! I enjoy every moment in the movie and enjoy the acting, and generally at home. Not bad, but not bad! If your idea of a good horror film is weak (or at least that it hasn't had much action in it in the past), then this one probably won't appeal to you!
pos I found this movie a little disappointing, but not all that bad. There were too many bad movies in it. There were too many riffs and references and plot-theorchestratus dialog was just plain boring and uninteresting. There were too many plot holes and clichÃ©d Westerns. I can't think of many good plot twists, plot twists, romance, plot twists etc.. None of them were as good as they should have been. What I can say is that the Plot was a lot of fun for me. I enjoyed it a lot. I like the structure of the story and I thought it was interesting. There were no big bad plot twists, I just felt that it was all about one guy getting knocked out because of it. Overall I like this movie a lot and hope whoever liked it liked it liked it too. I can't recommend this movie to anyone.
pos I am extremely excited about this film. Its story is extremely dark and earthy and is a very interesting trip for me. It is also very well acted. It unfolds very well and tries very hard to keep pace with the action. Its cast is very interesting and I would highly recommend whoever is in the cast would be very, very good for this film. I particularly loved Marlon Brando as Kitty in this movie. I have seen it a couple of times, it is well worth the watch. Definitely recommend this movie for those who enjoy dark comedy but still have a hard time fully embracing the mystery regarding this mysterious creature. This is definitely the creepier movie, it is hard to get me to like a film like this because of the cast but not bad nor the baddie/villain/person/monster thing.I loved it and will definitely recommend it. I will definitely recommend it to anyone needing an excuse to look up in the cinema, as the story is very dark. Definitely recommend it to anyone needing an excuse to look up in the theater or simply want to jump off a cliffhanger.
pos I generally find the depiction of this movie to be somewhat disturbing and at times makes me wish the director would hire more writers to write the dialog. I love the simplicity and the contrast in the two stories which follow suit. But in the end, this movie really grabs me by the proverbial balls. I love the simplicity and the mystery and I love the twist, and maybe it was inspired by a true love story. I also love the way the characters came together because they had this same boyish charm. I love that they didn't reveal their identity to everyone in the story. They didn't reveal their true love so much as they did. I think that was an entirely justified reason for their handling of it. It adds a dimension to the whole story and makes it easier to connect the two stories together. I love the twist at the end, because I think it adds more to the mystery than it already seems. I just can't seem to get over how far this movie takes me. It would have been OK for me to rewrite and maybe even break out some of the fun into more interesting parts. (Besides, I like how the characters are portrayed and the way they all talk about their love story. They certainly didn't
pos Excellent thriller thriller, made for TV and/or, uhhh, DVD available in cinemas around the world. In between two stories that seem like they came from different stories, the plot unfolds like this: one story involves a young man named Karl (Frank Borzage) who is an inventor of a mysterious substance causing insomnia and constant nightmares. The other story involves a young waitress (Bonham-Carter) who wants nothing more than to make a wedding dinner with her fiance. After convincing her that he has a hidden drug in his system, she starts a relationship with a man she knows from an earlier relationship. The plot unfolds like this: the life of a drifter in the early 60s, Karl depends on a wheelchair, a nympho (Lydia) to provide him with his "permanent mental" and "media" during his transition from youth to 'young', when he becomes a father to a man he knows through a hidden love story involving prostitutes. On the one hand, I can understand why
pos Timberlake was hot and handled his part perfectly. There was some suspense in the dialogue but nothing bad was done.Morgan Freeman was hot and handled it well. The acting was conducted with a warm heart, and the cinematography was a real standout.Morgan Freeman was believable as the Colonel, as always, but he was miscast and did a terrible job.Morgan Freeman was hot and handled his part perfectly.Morgan Freeman was believable as General Lorenz (the captain), but he was miscast and did a terrible job.Morgan Freeman did a great job at portraying Lorenz's insinuation that the Colonel wasn't a good enough captain for this job.Morgan Freeman was hot and handled his part perfectly, but in this version he was miscast and did a terrible job.Morgan Freeman was miscast and should have left the job to come up with a more worthy director.Morgan Freeman was miscast and should be permanently eliminated from the movie roles. (Let me assure you that this is not a great movie, but rather a great idea.) If you like fast paced thriller, this movie is for you. Go make your wallet (or something valuable, for that matter) and slash and chew some chocolate covered espresso beans.
neg This was so badly done that it felt like a mere episode of 'Hamlet'.I sat down to watch it and thought about how badly it was going to get this far. It was robotic. There were no words for it. Its main disadvantage is its speed, I think. Although you can argue that this is how our entertainment stores run, its handling is robotic and there is more going on than that in this technological mess. What the hell can I say? I can only say that it is truly awful. Of course I watched the whole episode and loved it. Was it really that bad? Definitely not bad. I just wanted to watch the whole thing because I wanted to watch something positive. I think it was the most fun I've ever had.
neg After seeing this movie I still had a hard time fully laughing. How anyone can laugh like that can be very scary.I love how huge the earthshaking sound came alive, and how Anisio is overcome with despair by despair. I can tell you that his wife, Georgia, died in a car wreck while in a mental institution. This was a real struggle for him. I wish I could have seen his wife cry and die in such an awful way. It's hard to get me thru it.
neg This movie was an essential part of my training for ASL. It was the perfect partner of ASL.I love the fact that they gave me the best of their time in the making of this movie and they made it easy to do so. I loved that the tree and the bed was made of REAL trees and they made it look
neg This is a wonderful movie, made mostly of woodcuts, and with an amazing cast. The story is extremely well-developed, and it alludes to the fact that the tree-shaking scene in the lake can happen in such a way that other people can see it in the background. It is extremely disturbing how anyone can think "how can I wrap my head around this?" And the ending is so very well-written that I turned down an episode just to watch it.I really liked how Anastasia changed her ways recently. I don't know much about her personality. I really don't know much about her personality. I just think she is beautiful and has a fantastic voice. I can't speak Spanish, I'm not entirely sure where she came from, and there is definitely no grey area in her personality. If you can't appreciate the beauty of this movie, skip it.
neg It was fun to watch all 31 of those great romantic comedies with beautiful vistas, great acting, great direction... but not all of them are as bad as this one. I love Cinderella. She was such a big plus. She was the most charming thing in all the series. She was the bestie in the entire story. Her personality was adorable and yet... evil. I love Cinderella. She was always the perfect partner. And yet... she was evil, every moment she was here was a big plus. Cinderella II was evil. She always wanted to be loved and be with men and to make men happy. Now she has been. I don't know who will come in to see this film and if they will do it, but I will watch it. I won't bother trying to explain all of this. So here it is. It is a Wonderful Life movie. It is not bad either way but it was fun to watch and get some sleep after a long day's hard, drawn out and boring. I love Cinderella. But I can't seem to muster the strength to give this movie the five stars it deserves. I would only recommend it to anyone who loves Cinderella II or II:Dreams Come
neg I will never watch horror movies again, even though I have read many good horror movies over the years. My son loves to doze off after school and doesze off
neg This is a good movie that tries hard to stick to the exact same themes throughout and tries hard to stick to the exact same ending as well. It also has a nice cast that is very well cast and is believable and believable, though I did have doubts about it coming out the same way as I did because I've seen several horror movies in my time, and this movie has them all: 1) Acting, 2) Acting, 3) Acting, and 4) Acting. I would say this is the worst horror movie I have ever seen. Its villain is a big bad guy, who tries to get hold
neg This movie was extremely weak. It had no chemistry at all. And I don't think it continues to this movie the way it should. I think the creator deliberately kept everything out of focus and the plot too predictable. It was predictable and it was very well-written.I really can't tell you how bad this movie was because I've read an awful lot of bad movies and all of them are generally unfunny and insulting to the viewer. I mean "What a terrible movie!" Yes, it was written with a capital 'A'. But thats a different story. I can tell you that, based on my perception of the audience, it is hard to fully put a number on the characters in this movie. None of them are likable, which is OK, but I can tell you that there are at least two decent players in the movie, and the supporting cast are decent.I really enjoyed this movie, and I will go to the set for the entire film if they come back.
neg I would like to give this movie 3 stars because I love the movie and because I
neg When I saw this movie I didn't really like the direction...maybe because I was too young to appreciate and I had seen a lot of bad movies in my time. Of course I watched too many bad movies, not bad but bad movies.I just didn't like how it all came together so easily. I wish that Sofia Coppola would never have let her actors get in the way, in part because I couldn't help but feel ripped off after seeing this movie. My guess is that Sofia Coppola would have kept her personality out of this movie. Sofia Coppola is no Mother Theresa but she still has the charisma to become a true Mother Theresa.I just couldn't get over it. The acting wasn't all that great and yet there were some brilliant supporting characters (e.g. Alicia Silverstone) and a warm heart (cf. D'oh!) as the two of them try to help each other through their struggles. This is a very good movie but not great. It is just that Sofia Coppola is so dewy and persuasive. Her love story seems very romantic and all the supporting characters are just as touching as her tragic sister-in-law. It is
neg This movie had to be the worst movie I have ever seen. It was awful bad. I really can't get over how bad this movie went down. I wish I could have watched the whole movie in my mind, but I can't think of anything positive to say about it. This movie was awful bad. I wish I could have watched more movies like "Hooper" and "Rent-A-Cop" etc. There was more action and bloodshed than most horror movies, and the setting and setting was awful. The acting was terrible,the setting was terrible,the script was awful. I wish it wasn't bad enough to be called a horror movie but it wasn't even worth it. I wish I was more of a maniac in charge of some kind of a plot. I wish Alicia Silverstone would rewrite this into a more digestible novel. Would you like to see my new novel? OK, OK, OK.
neg This film is extremely entertaining, at a very high school level, with high drama, comedy, romance, romance, romance, and drama in between two very good friends.I love it! It is one of those movies that is so much fun to watch and the other is so much fun to do. The story is so funny, and you know you'll get it in the film. The cast is so well-written, and so is the entire cast. It is hard to get me to care, and so I thought this would be a good introduction to my love of film comedy.
neg This was so good that it made me grind my teeth with despair. Was it a wise investment? Perhaps, but I am certain that by the time I got older I would have learned a terrible lesson. For more than two hours I was unable to eat my lunch. In fact, I almost died from boredom.
neg It's the worst horror movie ever made. If you can't sleep, get up early and get some good, hard, fast sleep. It's the worst movie you can possibly get away with, and if you can't get it, it'll be in a very bad place in the future. There is absolutely no reason why anyone should get a copy of this movie, no matter how bad it is. I bought it for Â£3.00 ($1.50 for me and Â£1.50 for my son.) From a very early age I always thought it was a great horror movie. It was scary at times and I don't think it's worth the $1.00 to get an independent horror film in the same big box as it did. The ghosts inhabit our households and tell us about things we don't like and things we do not like. The creepiness and evil is the result of a mixture of different sensibility and different stories. I also disliked the sound of shattering glass or the scratchiness of glass being thrown
neg The film did not follow suit to the original, however. When I watched it I got a little bored halfway through, and the action was over. The villain was the bad guy, the plot was poor, and there was some suspense. The villain was just a parasite because he has no taste for women. The only redeeming feature of the film was the fact that the government has no interest in prosecuting or banning prostitutes in the early 80's. The plot was predictable and did not follow suit to the rest of the movie. Once I watched it, I became very bored and bored of it. Once I get the hang of it, I will give this movie 4 out of five stars! Yes, 4.5 stars is the best way to go and maybe even 4.5 out of five stars would make it better for everyone!
neg I was very young when this film was made but it has taken me by far to forgive and all but I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on this movie. What a let down! What a weak excuse it was for my sister to miss the third film in this series. I wish I was dead!
neg This movie is fun to watch. It's funny because we all seem at home watching the same movie. There are two stories, one about the lake and the other about the nature and the life of a true lake inhabitant. It's also very dark. There are a few other characters (that I didn't care for) in this movie that seem like they all came from different classes. One character I didn't like is that one guy in the village called the Bear Trap. It didn't surprise me to see him tossed in the lake with the sword in his back. This movie is fun to watch. The main character is very good, and even though he's not as bad as some of the stereotypical stereotypical bad guys in the movie, he still keeps you amused even after the action is over. You just had to forgive the unevenness in some parts and still loved the acting. I can't believe this movie has grabbed my heart in the end. My favorite character from the movie was EAST OF THE BORNEO, and it's the same feeling I had
neg This movie was completely pointless and insulting to fans of the original Soul Survivors. The plot was completely pointless at the beginning and ended with Soul Survivors being dragged through it like some sort of natural animal. Even the most intelligent of the viewers who were expecting something along the line of "yo soyy guy" would have been sourly disappointed. Once I saw it, it became a little easier to forgive the wasted time and focus on other things. What's more, the story line was similar to how a classic Soul Survivors story is now being
neg This movie is so bad, I just can't seem to muster the strength to say anything about it. It has no redeeming virtue for being bad, not even the most feeble of arguments raised by the weakest of arguments, which means that the final solution to your problem is just an artist's rendering of an artist's rendering of a flawed, badly-conceived piece of work, and you still have to struggle to get a half-way decent grasp of the meaning behind each change. This also means that even though I like animated shows that aren't dumbed down, they still manage to uphold the viewer's patience and professionalism throughout their presentation, despite the fact that they tend not to consider this film's content. If you can't appreciate that quality of animation you should just skip it.
neg This is such a great movie! I love how Anisio is always entertaining and funny, I particularly loved the Sin City sidekick Paulo Miklos ending in the climax! This is one of those cases when you actually feel good about something and then something bad happens to you... (Or rather, something bad)I dunno if this was the greatest movie ever made, or maybe even the greatest film ever made! But for the most part it is still entertaining and touching. I like how Anisio always keeps his audience amused throughout the entire film. It's nice that Anisio always keeps his characters' interest throughout the entire movie.
neg A disappointing movie. The cast is decent, but not great either. It's a shame, because I know the director (who directed this) has a hard time keeping his focus on what really counts. Overall, a disappointing movie. 9 out of 10, I am pleased with the ending.
neg This is not a great movie but I will give this movie a miss. Overall it looks AWESOME!!! I've seen this movie a couple of times and it still hasn't been great, so much the better this movie was. I would recommend it for anyone needing an excuse to get some sleep. If your like me then skip this.
neg This movie was supposed to be a satire of the 1980s, but its plot was completely imbecilic and hypocritical. For more than 30 years, I've watched and survived many serious mental illnesses, and there were times I genuinely felt the need to register for help after being unable to get my $20.00 in or even check in to a mental institution. Luckily, there were no other mental illnesses that plagued my life. The only positive elements of the movie were the characters. None of the main characters were likable, the story was poor and did not follow suit to the aforementioned description. None of the main characters are likable and all form an insipid relationship with each other. The acting wasn't as bad as most people would have liked it, but it was still entertaining and entertaining. Not that I complained about it. I loved it and would recommend it for those who are depressed, anxious, tired or just plain bored, or just want to watch the whole movie on their way out of town.
neg This movie has none! It is just plain boring. The plot is so broken, and the dialogue is almost painful and contrived. I wish Alicia Silverstone would hire some writers to rewrite it. I wish Alicia Silverstone was here. She should hire some decent writers. I'd really like to hire some decent writers to do this movie, and I wish Alicia could hire some decent writers to write jokes, romance, plot twists, etc. etc. etc. I wish Alicia was here. I wish Alicia was here, because she has talent, she should have showed me how to do this job, and she should have brought her to America. Her recent promotion to the position of best actress in America has made me appreciate Alicia even more. I love her, and she is every bit as good as every person I know. Her amazing talent and professionalism makes this movie unique. It is a perfect portrayal of the American dream, and it is the perfect way to look at the future. The only
neg From the viewpoint of a relatively young Brad Pitt in this biopic helmed by slash and shock meister Carpenter, director Kenneth Branagh and star/producer Jude Law deluded themselves that they were still in LV. 8 when they made this movie and thus through it they have successfully moulded their fictional Matthias Popkin (Frank Morgan) into an entirely bad guy determined not to take the upfront payment without doing some real estate business. He keeps his
neg I don't think this movie is great. Its only saving grace is that its stars are so perfectly cast. Im glad to see that there are no grey area in the story. The story is not perfect, its characters are just plain boring and flat. Im glad i made this movie and it is still fresh and entertaining. Thanks to my girlfriend for making it!
neg This is a genuine treasure story! (and, more importantly, a genuine love story!) By exploring our imagination and exploring our love of nature in this lyrical, engaging and charming little shop! This little shop has something for everyone! It's kind of like Cinderella's story about an old lady that doesn't love the person in the first place, and yet she's chosen not to give her cancer but still gets carried away by her tragic life! (and the life!) And of course, there are all kinds of things that can happen in your life! Things that will happen to you! Things you can do with your life!
neg This is a glossy horror movie, and its villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. The story is pretty lame, and the espresso beans don't really work for me in this flick. Overall it is good, but I like the characters a lot. I really loved this movie. I love how they came from different classes and looked different from one another in this flick. I really enjoyed it and thought it was cleverly put together. Although I can't seem to muster the strength to finish this in 2 hours, this is one of those films I really love. I can't recommend it to anyone.
neg Although properly warned I was unable to discern anything about the plot and did not give it much credit. However, it is interesting to read some of the comments on this film. In fact, this is a very good movie at an interesting time in the history of cinema. The villain of "Nightmares" is extremely well-developed, and there are a good many good plot twists and there are good supporting characters. I am pleased with the conclusion to this film. The only

neg I had previously written this in the same vein, but thought that maybe this was meant to be a more digestible version of my thought. Maybe this is just me, but I can tell you that I saw and still congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket. Of course I had no idea that tickets would get me to where I am now playing in the future. My expectations were not as high, nor were they high in relation to the previous two. Not even close to where they were now. I was enticed to watch it in my local video store. This was not my first time watching a Pakistani cricket documentary and I was pleasantly surprised to see that instead of being surprised I was pleasantly surprised to see the cricket documentary. I was very excited to see the documentary. Of course it is a Pakistani documentary. It is 100% positive to see the cricket documentary and all the good things it has to do with England. It has a nice quality to it and it is fun to watch the whole series. Was it worth it? Well, I think it was worth it to see how the cricket documentary was filmed. I have seen a lot of great things in the past and in some of them I really loved them.

neg This movie is extremely bad and it is so weak. I know it sounds exciting but I really can't speak to the subtleties because I can't really tell you them. I've seen bad movies but not this bad. I will give this one more chance. I'll give this movie 2 stars. If you love zombies, you should give this movie a miss. 7/10.
neg This film is a great film. Very sexy, fast paced, with beautiful cinematography and action. Very sexy plot, with lots of blood and graphic sex scenes and a great cast. Jennifer looked great in this movie, but I was too young to get my father to like her, so I guess it was my fault. Jennifer looked like a ten year old when she fell down in love with Brad Pitt, but I guess that was because I was too young to watch this movie. Once I got older, I converted to porn and became more into porn. I would recommend to watch this movie if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love in the future. 9 out of 10.
neg I've seen movies that were rated R, none of them had the humor and the plot, and were completely bored throughout. What i didn't like was the depiction of the geriatric ensemble of geriatric magicians that practiced in a mental institution. In fact, I don't think they've ever asked for a "comedy" treatment, and i'm pretty sure that their assessment of your mental state will be sourly disappointed. I would recommend it to all your mental and spiritual needs. My husband and I have always had very different routines for each and every single day. We dozed off for a cigarette or two, or sat down in front of the TV and read some funny books on the way to the "fun". When it finally came on I realized that my wife actually laughs a lot, she obviously laughs a lot, she really has a great heart to all of you. And she really, really bad-mouthed us all the time.
neg This movie is so lame you actually have to actually watch it to open your minds to it all, then maybe skip this and focus on something else. Once the dialog is over, it is all over and it is all at the same time. The graphics are weak, overall giving the impression that you can't understand anything at all. I mean, I don't really blame anyone for this movie, though I do think it's a terrible miss. If it's good, it's because the dialogue and the acting are terrible. Not to be confused with the acting, though, because they tend to build things around a plot which makes them appear pointless, or at least they tend to in some way to. They tend to get carried away and simply ignore the drama as soon as the conclusion.
neg This is an extremely weak martial arts film, and doesn't really hve it a good job at all. It has absolutely nothing to do with acting. There are a bunch of characters that seem like they all talk about something in the plot that doesn't seem related to what they are doing and basically don't understand the plot. It continues to struggle in my mind, mostly because of the way they chose to dramatize the psychological process called individuation. They tend to do this in a very dark and stormy, setting them up in a very dark plot where they seem intent on murder. Once they get them together, they become very interesting as they both seem to care very much for each other. I really can't get over all of them in this short but, it works out to the point where they both seem like they are in love.I really enjoyed this film so much, and I am

The acting is decent, though some of the plot twists are a tad contrived and all form a very good plot. Overall I would recommend this movie to anyone needing an excuse to fall asleep, wishing I could get some sleep. Don't get me wrong, this movie is fun to watch and all at the same time.
neg This movie is a satire of the famed "Hamlet" musical. The story revolves around a motley group of people that want to make a real Hamlet - a spoof of the famed play.

neg I have no doubts about the quality of this film, it is simply breathtaking. I can't get over all of that love in this film and yet, it does have moments of tremendous beauty. The acting is perfect and the story is all the rage and drama of the movie. Everyone who loves this film should go to see another film about love. If you love love love a monster, this is the film to watch! This movie is for you. Go to the movies lover's closet and get some love. Don't get me wrong, this is an extremely good film. It has a nice plot and all that, it is well-written, well-written, and has a great cast. I love the acting and especially Marlene Dietrich and her beautiful understated beauty. I also like that the director turned down the creepy child-saving mask she had in her collection because he/she really wanted to make her more scary. This movie has a very good supporting cast. It is funny, Karen Black is a very good actress, but she is also very good as a monster and this film is just as good as a romantic comedy. The acting is also very good. I absolutely loved how much this movie was about
neg In terms of content, quality and fun this movie was outstanding. Very entertaining movie. Was the only western I own and watch. Worth recommending for those who like Eclectic Love and the King Creole. Don't get me wrong, I give this movie 3 stars because it doesn't follow suit to the book. If I were to rent it for $3 or less I would definitely give this movie 3.5 stars.
neg This movie was so bad, I had to ask the director, and he made me lie down to watch it all. There wasn't much to say about it other than that.I would rewrite the plot and rewrite a number of other things, like how many people wore eyeliner in this movie, how far along they were in their relationship, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. It wasn't funny, was funny, was a really bad movie. The acting was terrible, and did not deliver what I was looking for. The acting was awful, as was the dialogue. There were too many mistakes throughout the dialog and it was all at a level of depth that I can breath through. How can anyone understand this without being dumb? I don't know what happened to them, but whatever the director, it was all the rage of the movie demons. I watched it for awhile and it became obvious that it wasn't funny. Was it supposed to be funny? I don't know. How can I wrap this up? I wish I knew better, but I can't seem to muster the strength to say that it was a horrible movie. Whatever the case
neg This film is a rip-off of Akira Askeys, a genuine collector of ancient Japanese history. Akira is essentially a rip-off of King Creole II: Warrior Princess, the story revolves around two young men (one of them inheriting from an earlier era) chosen to enlist in the Army during the invasion of the newly-liberated territory of Nohr-Yan territory. (The other man, the son of a fallen star fallen in the war, is a Yokai Warriors who has lost his memory of the last 20 years of his life to a brain cancer, and therefore is unable to pay the price for his memory loss.) After the invasion of Nohr-Yan (whereupon the fallen star has been permanently purged from memory) the old hero is given a rare, spiritual and spiritual sword that only rarely seems to be in his blood. (His father, the famed inventor of the sword) After destroying the old man's memory, he pledges himself to the cause of the war and pledges to never give it up again. (His younger sister, Georgia, also inherits a son from a fallen star, but she still has a son.) To use a real world war time-waster as
neg This movie is so awful, you just don't understand what it is about that it is about. Its plot is so weak it ruins everything. It seems like a good movie at worst, like Cinderella II:Dreams Come True. Even though Cinderella II was written by some very good people (that I am sure you're reading this right) it is almost unrecognizable from the 1940s when all the characters were "made". Cinderella II is simply beautiful and evil. Its story revolves around a very annoying girl (Susan) who always skits the "spot the most evil" line in her life. When I was a kid I remember fond memories of her and her constant "spot the most evil" line. Everyone says to the kids that their lines should be rediscovered and maybe replaced with more beautiful pictures. However, in reality none of them know how to make love to a man. So in this movie I gave Cinderella II:Dreams Come True a 7/10.
neg I generally find that movies that I like (with humor or class) fail to follow through on their ambition to achieve true greatness simply because they can't keep up with the pace of mainstream cinema. However, there are films that really try and make a real finish in the story by tying everything together rather than tying everything into a single movie. Not a great film for me.I enjoy watching lots of bad movies but this one just keeps me amused. (Besides its charm is that it knows how to make a good movie)The story is basically a rip-off of King Creole (the King Creole) playing the king bad guy in a very bad role. Little does he suspect that somebody out there is doing it to get some recognition. That movie was lame, lame and budget non existent. None of the above are fault-lines, some are just plain bad. King Creole is King Creole.Creole isn't funny. All of his jokes are lame. The King Creole is the King Creole, he is just humored.Creole sings and dances in a very low key, he is just generally unfunny. He almost always skits invective, as though it is part of
neg This movie was extremely weak and uninspired. The plot was extremely weak and uninteresting and thus I felt that it was the duty of the director to give the audience "permanent nightmares" every time they hear about a plot or two. What a tragedy. I'd like to argue that instead of making fun of the movie, the audience should just be amused and simply focus on their lines of dialogue. I wish the actors would have kept the focus on other things instead of playing up their parts. Overall, this movie was a failure. If you can't get a half-way decent comedy from Hollywood, then you can't get a half-way decent comedy from your local theater.
neg This is simply disgusting how the government takes huge advantage of our ignorance and continually hides behind the "philosophical and artistic" hype. People getting too young to know that there is nothing in common (your IQ, your taste, your sexual nature) makes them appear ignorant or out of place. To the point of being able to explain to them why they are attracted to men (or women), you need not bother citing some psychological process to get them to "enjoy" the experience of love. Men can just find men through "dreams" or through "psychic" or other means, and simply go to the nearest "retracted" newspaper, meet a guy, talk about it for an hour, and then finally get the "art". Women are not supposed to be attracted to men because of their looks (look down, you fatness!), and men are supposed to be attracted only to "good guy". This is so to say, that they are attracted to "boy". "good guy" is not a man (but men are attracted to all kinds of men). They all know THAT. It's not how a man should act, it's how he should act - just like any other person. To use
neg This film was extremely weak and uninspired. As I've said before, this film was filmed in my home town, New York. The acting was poor, in part because the production designer and his crew didn't have the necessary props and the lighting was either too bad or too bad. Overall, it was extremely disappointing and I
neg This film is extremely weak and overall weak. There is too much of a plot and too little focus being placed on this topic, I think this is simply the worst film I have ever seen. I can't even get my $20 every time I go to the theater, which makes it seem like it was my home and not even the most important part of the movie. It would have been nice to have had more focus and direction for the entire film. But I guess this is just not enough to convince me that it is worthy of being checked out of my collection and that maybe I should just skip this movie, it would have been OK. It would have been OK for me to give this film another chance. I bought it in a 2 DVD set and it looked great on DVD, it was perfect. I can't get over the visual quality. I had a hard time watching it and the actors seemed out of place and in some places they didn't move along at all. This is one of the worst films I have ever seen. I will never watch this film again.
neg This is an extremely poor excuse for the BBC iPlayer. The iPlayer was designed to be an independent rather than an "open-ended" cinema. It has an awful long history. There were far too many mistakes throughout the creation of this technological world and i hope to get the better of them and show the flaws and limitations of the 3D format in this presentation. None of the above mentioned flaws were actually mentioned here. The iPlayer has a good supporting cast and a good supporting cast that makes it easier to understand the plot and characters and how the various stories are being told. This presentation of the film was not well thought out and it was only because iPlayer was made up of entirely new material which makes it easier to understand them. It has a good supporting cast, good direction, good acting and a good script. All of the characters are very well portrayed in this presentation but this is simply not a good introduction to all of the characters and their relationships with each other. The story is poor, the structure is poor, the structure is weak and in some parts there is no substance at all to this. The structure is weak and in some parts it is even worse than in the other 3D. This presentation almost

There are a few clips and a good many of them are either poorly done (e.g. a gratuitous nipple shot), the other is more important in the making of "Nightmares" movies. In the end I think this movie captured our imagination quite well. The acting wasn't bad at all. Overall, it was fun to watch and to be part of. It was a good movie but I wish that it wasn't this bad since I can still find my way back to the theater one more time.
neg This is simply ridiculous. It's so lame, it's almost painful. People getting hit by car is not funny. Cars are not funny. Adults can laugh it off, it just keeps them amused and chuckling to themselves. How many people actually do that to each other? This is ridiculous. How many children are laughing? What are you going to do with your life? I mean, are you going to get 750% suspended animation? Thats the easy part, you know you're going to get 750% suspended animation. It's not like they were laughing anymore! Yes, in fact it is funny! But I'll say this: Auteuil. What I liked best about him was his way of teaching us how to be funny. I mean, we all saw him out with his friends on the road and at the movies and he really
neg This movie had none of the above. A nihilistic, pre Xena: Warrior Princess meets Xena: Warrior Princess in the title role of the mysterious ninja under the mysterious ninja (part of the mystical ninja family). It stars Michelle Forbes as Kitty, a former lover of Osama Bin Laden, who has only recently returned to the US after she met the man who has given her his cancer to make love to Susan instead of Osama. She is the wife of Osama Bin Laden, who is a major terrorist who has given her cancer to Susan, who is virtually unrecognizable from the image of Osama Bin Laden, when compared to the woman. Also stars David Ogden Stiers as Kitty. (This movie is best of the best film history I have ever seen) and Glenda Farrell as the doting sister of Osama Bin Laden and Glenda. Very sexy. (Besides the love story, it stars a nice, young Brad Pitt and actor.) Enjoy it, folks!
neg This movie was so good I almost died from boredom. It was so bad I almost fell asleep in my seat at the theater and looked up at the bored, bored audience member who was making jokes about his life and hating it all the time. I don't really blame the theater for that. None of my friends were laughing or even making jokes. I don't really blame the theater in this movie. None of them were laughing at all these movies, at least not this one. None of them had funny faces. They were all in some funny roles that weren't funny, but I was dragged along by a very annoying male friend to do them for my entertainment. I really like how they all talk about how much they love each other, it's hard to actually get all of the jokes out there and yet still amusing even after having the fun with each other for
neg This is an extremely weak martial arts film. Like most of the martial arts movies out there it is simply not enough to actually show the fighting to actually be interesting. This means the audience gets bored and is bored halfway through the movie. Once they do get a good grasp of the plot and the fighting, they get bored quickly and simply ignore it.
neg This is an extremely long film, so I wanted to give it 3 stars instead. None of the characters are likable at all. None of the main characters are likable in this film. None of the characters are likable and thus should not be picked on. This is not a good film. Avoid this movie.
neg This is the third time the director has let the show loose to let loose an entirely new cast in which he felt it was his duty to uphold the prestige and professionalism of the series despite the fact that it operates at a young audience age. It is hard to conceive that anyone would go to any expense in releasing such a large amount of talent into such a weak, infantile yet charming little village. That being said, it is clever to simply ignore and instead focus on the characters and plot and rather focus on the themes. There are two very interesting things which need to be mentioned here and which I am
neg The storyline established our protagonist as Chrissy, we learn that Chrissy is not a very good person when it comes to love and that she is just "here" in this world. So we must struggle to find our way to happiness through the constant bullying, the constant bullying of men, the constant threat of the unknown, the constant threat of the unknown, and Chrissy herself. To find our way to true love and happiness, we must first find our way to the "wrong" side of the road. I.e.. a.Place of mental disarray. In this case Chrissy has resorted to writing checks to men that seem to genuinely love her and make a "veteran" (or rather "boyfriend" role play) of their life. The main character (male friend/boyfriend?)is an extremely annoying character. The main disadvantage of living with your heart broken is that you get nothing in return. So to complicate matters, we have to ask you a question, which is more important than the fact that you are expected to answer in the most insulting way possible? Hmm...maybe it's time for a new take on the character and the relationships.
neg This was a bloated horror film, with an overambitious cast, music and direction that is still being practiced today. Its villain is strangled in the last twenty minutes as a maniacal, yet his motives and motivations are still being revealed in this flick. Its villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans that are mysteriously sprung from a mysterious substance in a man's bloodbath.Its plot twists are all the more hilarious because they connect with one another in a totally unexpected way. Its conclusion is that, after several murders in this movie, this is the most gruesome yet unintentionally funny thing you can think about in your life. And boy, howdy did it get me.
neg This was a disappointing movie in a way, not so much that I would have liked to see it again, as a result of the fact that I watched it at the 30'Th Gothenburg Film Festival in my old town.I can't quite get over the guilt I feel for those people who were young and impressionable and bored at the same time. There are times in your life that you find it particularly hard to work through all that, such as when you don't get what you're looking for after, when you constantly feel alone and lonely. But this movie was actually fun to watch, at the same time it was entertaining, and even though I complained about the acting in the dialog and basically had to work it out with my friends for the day, it gave me a lot of fun to watch it again. Not contentedly did I enjoy it.
neg This is a satire of course, and I mean really bad. There isn't enough words for all of the characters to be dumbed down here, and it takes the biscuit to get all the characters to understand each other and the importance of each other. And if it's possible to get them to like each other in real life, that would be easier if they were married. To complicate matters, there isn't enough words to make the point that this movie is so bad, that it would be hilarious to see two different ways to get along. And even though I don't know the plot, I can assure you that you'll get bored pretty quickly after watching it.
neg This movie was a horrible, uninspired murder mystery thriller about a young man who was manipulated and moulded through an expensive relationship that eventually leads to the murder of his wife, by paramour Spencer Tracy. Tracy was given the task to kill his wife, and he did it despite being told that the local sheriff already knew he was going to get away with it. Tracy was given the task to kill his wife as a means to get some revenge on Spencer. Tracy was given $20,000 to kill his wife in what was clearly a very big terrorist plot. This means that the local sheriff has to use some form of mental or emotional blackmail to get his wife's finger in order to get him to register as a suspect in relation to his crimes. Once there he has to convince his wife to register as a suspect, and then get hold

neg This movie is very entertaining, it is fun to watch and all the characters are well developed and are well developed. This movie had me laughing a lot during the movie and it was fun to watch a while away from home. Not many movies like this type of movie go to waste because they tend not to follow the guidelines or the directions. If I wanted to watch an entire film about a single character I'd give this magnificent, unique and unique feature film 3 out of four. This movie is a must see for those people who like to delve into the mystery surrounding the mysterious girl and the mysterious death of her fiance. My special favorites are Cinderella II:Dreams Come True, Cinderella II:Dreams Come True, Cinderella II:Dreams Come True. This is the best movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch in theaters. There are times you feel pity for the poor, superstitious, superstitious, and amateurish actress chosen to portray such a weak and infantile character in a low-grade film form, but these days are over and all that. Cinderella II:Dreams Come True is still an enjoyable movie to watch, though if you like fast paced, action, keep an eye out for the funny and
neg This isn't like Star Wars. The villain is simply a bad guy, and the story revolves around his life, not your average teen romance. What makes this film unique is its cast, the fact that it stars a slew of entirely engaging characters, and its story is almost completely predictable. The plot is almost entirely predictable, and revolves around two very different stories. Plot and dialogue are almost non sequiters. You don't need an "open minded" to open your minds to the plot, but to simply enjoy the movie. I found it particularly heart-wrenching that Anisio was able to recreate some of the
neg This film is a rip-off of Akira, made in 2004 by Togar's discarded after the events of that Japanese war. Its villain is none other than Miike (Reito Miike). Once again we have an almost unrecognizable antagonist, and this time the director is clearly operating from the viewpoint of a newly-installed American family. (His *spoiler* here is simply not enough to convince me that the plot is a rip-off of the classic, or at least that it was written in a different language than what most people actually think is in the title. My suspicion is that this film is not as good as a real-movie, as everyone who serves time away from home should know. Regarding the story, the main disadvantage of this film is that it has none of the fun or class of its heroes. It has none of the fun to be the antagonist, and the villain is none of the above. The main disadvantage is that it is so weak and thus so weak that it is almost painful to watch it, but I think the most disappointing part of it all was the ending. The story is unremarkable, and it is almost as bad as if it was written with an approving eye,
neg This movie was extremely weak and uninspired. It wasn't even pretentious in regards to the title. I liked it as much as the rest of the cast did. It didn't hurt that much since it was made over a half hour ago. The story was almost completely pointless, and thus the only conclusion I can find is that this movie is an example of how to make a good horror film. It is extremely disturbing. I was completely bored throughout. It's funny how the prank phone calls were made and all the halloween night's entertainment went on for no reason at all. I wish I was more of a hero of this movie. I wish the creator would just hire some decent writers and directors to write jokes and/or a funny short, so that all that content could be hidden away. Not that I am a great fan of the gothic or violence of the original but I have read a fair few of the reviews on the internet. One reviewer stated that the film looks terrible and should be ashamed of itself. I agree. I give this movie 3 out of four stars!
neg This is such a great cultural event and I will go middle of road. When I do find myself in North Africa it has become a cultural myth. Western Africa is still in Africa and it is still growing. I was only about four years old when the invasion began. Africa is still very young, and I still congratulate myself for not wasting money on pointless pointless garbage, and I congratulate my country on its success. It has not lost a single village in Africa in the last 25 years. It is still an enjoyable experience to see, as is Africa. The view is not great either way, and the food was always better. I would say that the food was better, more palatine and better. The people were nicer and they certainly did not make the invasion a big event, it just continues to struggle to find our way to the upper echelons of Africa. Africa is not Africa, Africa is Africa. If Africa were a real place it would be the "liberation" of Africa. Its history would have been obliterated by the invasion and its subsequent creation by the Nandandiland (and the rest of Africa) after which it would have been proud of. Africa is Africa.

It has an extraordinary cast that includes Marv Alberte (Frank Morgan), Ava Gardner (Joseph Cornell), Burgess Meredith (Lionel Herring), Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith's sidekick, and Jim Metzler (Lionel Atwill, who appears only in this movie). At the time of writing, the cast is still fresh and talented. Special mention must be given to the director, writer, and star of this magnificent biopic of the famed stage magician Frank Borzage (who practiced under the watchful eye of Pavlov, and who practiced under the watchful eye of Pavlov) who wrote the 1972 version of "Nightmares" as a rather loony village idiot who collects bats, a demented demeanor, in a mental institution. At the risk of being too serious, Borzage (Matuschek & Co.) writes, "Nightmares is not a wonderful movie." This is one of Borzage's best-seller No Parking signs signs in America.

What I was reading was true, but what I saw was a rather boring movie with lots of gratuitous violence.The plot was poor, and there was no real suspense or drama in it. I would have liked to see a different ending. If it had been a different film, it would have been pulled out of this territory. This would be a great feature film for all ages and all levels of entertainment. The acting was poor, and there were too many mistakes in it. There was only ONE true love story in this film. The love story that the heroine/heroine/boyfriend has is not a bad thing, she's just not a good enough person to be here. If you can't love a good person, then maybe you should just skip this movie and get a good horror movie instead.
neg This movie was a total travesty of amateur sleuth detective work. A midget thief steals a big diamond and gets away with it. Then he hides out with a family pretending to be a baby. After convincing them that he is the father of the kidnapped girl, he is finally let loose on a local tv show. There is no grey area and no one is in the room when the big premiere of "The Hand That Rocks" comes on. This is a real shame since it takes place in a secluded estate in the middle of nowhere. In reality, it was an exceptionally poor handling of events. The plot was not even worth elementary school lunches. What the hell, did they get themselves in a mental institution for four months, alone? Who the hell knows what happened to them? Whatever the case, it was probably the most feeble excuse a Hollywood can muster up to get around the next superstar. The only redeeming feature of the movie was its bizarre title. Even the most infantile of the kids can appreciate the guilt of such unimaginative junk. Needless to say, I will give this movie 4 out of five stars. Rating it 4.
neg This movie was so great that I turned down a chance to watch it. It had the feel of being nothing more than a compilation of recycled material. When I watched it I got the feeling that I had seen much worse movies and television in my life. Alas, such films were so weak that I turned the DVD off. I turned it back on to watch.I sat down in my uncomfortable seat in the palm of my tablet, hating every moment that I had to watch it and waiting for the video to come on.I read some of the reviews on the DVD. It sounded like a long shot to me. I don't really know what to make of this movie, but I definitely recommend this movie to those who appreciate its subtleties and its myriad of characters. Its a great trip.
neg This movie was an essential part of my life, and I had been reading and reworking a lot over the years. I've read a lot about this movie over the years, and it has inspired a lot of my own personal struggles. The fact that this movie did not have a story to tell in it's title, did not follow suit to most of the other good horror movies out there, and that there wasn't even a single truly great plot. What an enjoyable experience for a viewing! It is a great mystery to me about the murders. I can't get over how many people were actually involved in this murder mystery. But I can tell you that there were at least two good reasons why it was so gruesome. The first reason why I am bothering to bother rehashing the plot here is because it is so well-written and clear that it is a well-written plot and not an excuse to gratuitous violence. There is no grey area between the two, and I can accept that. But that is not what this movie was about. I wanted to find out what other people were doing, so that I could find out the murderer and all those who knew him/her/that he had a hidden or
neg In conclusion we have seen the movie, Naked Gun, Naked Gun: Unlimited, Naked Gun: The Deadly Aftermath, Naked Gun Unlimited 2. We were very excited when the third party came in to provide feedback on the movie alright, and then some of the other random killings were justified. So to me this movie was just as bad as the original, Naked Gun. Naked Gun is a great movie, and you won't get tired of it. Naked Gun Unlimited was great, and it is one of those great great books, books which makes one forget just how bad it is. (Or maybe just watch the whole movie and get the "good guy" over there, after all). There are too many mistakes in this movie. The main disadvantage of Naked Gun Unlimited is that there are too many of them. There are two main mistakes here, and one that I found particularly distressing.First of all, the story introduces us to the plot very early in the movie, which basically means that you can get sucked into this great, massive, beautiful world that has taken our heroine, and we all too easily get sucked into it. (And boy did it fail me, it did fail me in some spectacular fashion, as well
neg The movie was extremely poor and did not follow suit to most of the previous films I have seen. I would only recommend it if anyone who loves challenging and fun can afford to miss it. My son is not so discriminating, he was given free to watch the whole movie, and he still has his "holiday" on his mind. If you can't get thru the break in, skip this and get some rest in the near future.
neg From the creators of "The Hand That Rocks This Rocks It" (2002), and "Man in the Sun" (2002), and "Man in White" (2002), this film displays a mixture of earnestness and tragedy. As we all know and will get to see, "Man in White" has a sentimental quality that can be found even in the most sentimental moments. While I have read that the spirits demonstrate gratitude to the person they love by setting them on a high, they don't really mean to brag about it. Rather, they just want to be along and happy with each other. This film has a sentimental quality to it. It's very good to see people like you around, because the spirits demonstrate a love story and quality rarely seen by western audiences. I love the characters, and especially the love story in this film. I wish Alicia Silverstone would become a more serious writer and director. I love the acting and the dialogue and there's something about that. I love and adored all the lovely touches and the eclecticism that accompany her. There is something about her that makes this film unique. There are some brilliant supporting characters, some brilliant acting, and some really touching scenes. And all
neg This is a cheap rip-off of the masterpeice "demons" I had in mind when I saw this movie years ago. When I saw it I got a really good laugh out of it. And to top it all, the sound effects were absolutely perfect and absolutely breathtaking. It was the greatest movie I've ever seen in theaters. The acting was so good and it was filmed in such a good pace that it almost felt like I was in a serious mental disarray. This was my first ever serious film about mental issues, and I have to admit it was probably the worst film I've ever seen. Not one movie has grabbed my heart in like a second, though. 9 out of 10, it is still an essential part of my life.
neg This movie has to be the worst movie I've ever seen. The action in this movie is speeded up, the resolution is unbelievable, and there is just nothing funny in it. It has no funny character interracial relations, it is totally boring, and it has nothing funny to actually funny in it. It has no funny sex scenes, and is basically just plain boring. The only fun I had in this movie was watching a long, boring movie, and I wish I was in North Africa. I had seen this movie years ago, and I still can't get over the scenery and the set design of this magnificent desert island. I can tell you that this movie was not 100% boring. I would rewrite the plot and maybe rewrite it
neg This is probably the best martial arts film in the entire history of cinema. If you love fast paced action thriller it is the perfect martial arts movie. It is highly recommended. Avoid being too caught up in the plot and focus simply on the action.Avoid the action at all expense. Avoid being too serious or too serious and simply focus on the fighting. Don't get me started on that. Avoid it.
neg This is my favorite animated movie so far. It was probably my favorite movie of all time. It is funny, it has a good pace and I think it adds a dimension to the story.I mentioned that Sofia Coppola deserved better. This is a pretty thin plot and basically a rip-off of Cinderella II. I wish Alicia Silverstone was here. Her voice is robotic and Donald Sutherland is prickly and unemotional. Donald Sutherland is funny, hard to work, and she is rather evil. Donald Sutherland is very good and often out with bad acting, bad scripts and bad directing. This film is so bad it has to be called "The Crocodile Hunter" by some. It was so bad, it compelled me to give this magnificent 3 out for a mere $3.00. (there are versions of it on DVD available from me but you can get it from me for $3.00 if you want to buy it, and you can get it
neg This is a great movie! Im glad I finally saw this film and was able to watch it in my home town of Little Rock, AR. It has grabbed my heart and made me want to miss the movie. I really can't say enough about it. It's such a great mystery!!! The only
neg I generally don't give a lot of thought to the films outside of the 30's and 50's films out there, but I really wanted to watch "Manos Â Hands of fate" every now and again. (Besides, it is nice to watch 80's humor forsaken horror movies. Though it makes sense that they should have kept this out of the mainstream in the 50's but hey, at least they gave you an excuse to watch it. And so, I watched the whole film on VHS. And so...this film was uplifting, funny, and scary. I felt it was time for a film to come out in cinemas, and maybe it would have been pulled off without being scary? I don't know. Maybe if I watched "Nightmares" in my teenage years, I would have seen more of it. (Besides, I love the eclecticism and the eclecticism of "Nightmares" movies but this film did not convince me to register with them.)But, I don't know if this film has anything to do with the story or not with the title. I found it particularly heart-throating. I don't really blame anyone for wanting to see the "Night
neg This movie is about a man named Ricky Gervais. Ricky Gervais is a big fan of American television and has always been very good about entertaining people. You see, in fact, most people know him well. You don't. You can see his amazing talent in this movie. The only other person in the movie was a very annoying, insipid personality in this movie. Ricky Gervais was very good in this movie. How can we all possibly be friends? I'm a big fan of him and I really can't wait to see more of his films because they've got me! So enjoy!
neg It is hard to fully understand why
neg This film is mildly entertaining and fun to watch. It is fast paced, with good acting and a good pace. I will give the 3 stars stars to everyone who loves to watch Kung Fu and Jack, and all of them positive, because they all have something valuable to say about Kung Fu. They all have positive elements to them. None of them hurt the film as much as the Kung Fu fans do, though it does raise the spirits of the Kung Fu fans. Overall, I enjoyed this film, and wish we would have seen it in the early 80's.
neg This film seems like a genuine gem. Very well made, very nice to see the original concept, and the cast and crew. The story is pretty hilarious. I really enjoyed it. How did they come up with this idea? I don't know, I think the spirits of the spirits have disturbed the spirits since the movie began, and it has been my experience that the spirits of these spirits have disturbed the spirits since they were sent by the spirits of the dead. I have to admit that I actually liked this movie a lot in the early 80's. I was taken by it and it became my favorite film of all time. This movie was good entertainment at the time it came out, and it is still an enjoyable movie to watch. Very good acting aside. Overall, if you can't sleep, get some sleep.
neg This movie has been banned in the USA for over two years and has been banned in the UK for almost two years.It continues to be watched in large part because the cast is so stupid, and because they spend so much time in the making of this movie. When I watched it I was very bored, but this movie has taken a great liking to it. It has become a cultural myth, and has not been banned in the USA. I was very bored throughout the entire movie, watching the whole thing, and it continues to occupy my mind throughout the movie. I will not be surprised if the film is in the back of my mind when the banning is finally over. If it continues to occupy my mind I will read the movie from beginning to the very end, and maybe it's because I can now find my way to more enlightened days. This movie was fun to watch, and so we have a good reason to be very happy.
neg Seriously, it's a great movie that finds humor in the creation of beautiful creatures. It also has a story that unfolds well and is well-developed in relation to other recent films. The story revolves around a young man named Ismael (Frank Morgan) and his struggles with various mental illnesses that eventually come together as a result of an overworking family.Morgan Freeman is just a parasite that tries to get a good job from working people around the world.Morgan Freeman is so bad that he constantly *knocks* on the door *knocks* every time he's out of the room, asking for permission to come in.Morgan Freeman *knocks* on the door and tells the stranger *everything in his life to do nothing', before the stranger steals the show.Morgan Freeman *knocks* the door down and then *knocks* the stranger's *out of the room* before the stranger *knocks* back in.Morgan Freeman *knocks* the door down while *knocks* another *open* door *knocks* out of the room and then *knocks* out of the room again* before *knocks* back in again* At that point, *very cold and *
neg A disappointing movie that almost completely bored me. How anyone could wrap up their thoughts about this movie and then go on to watch another movie would be extremely difficult and time-waster. I can't give complete credit to anyone, it was a wild concept. I really enjoyed it. I like how Anastasia changed the plot, there was just enough action to keep me amused throughout the movie. And, even though I was unable to sleep, my thoughts were all over the screen and in the book. It's strange to think that Sofia Coppola deserved an Oscar for her performance in this movie. She was hot, yet charming, yet irresistible in this movie. I love this movie and will definitely recommend it to all those who love Sofia Coppola! I really loved this movie. It is simply beautiful, and I would recommend it for all ages!
neg When I was very young I read every single Harry Potter novel. It was classics. The plot was very interesting and the fairytale quality was excellent. Overall, it was a great trip to see all the different stories and characters, and this movie is still a major Harry Potter fan favorite. My dad, who was born into a very poor household, is an extremely poor and lonely man. My sister has always insisted upon seeing a copy of the book, and she reads all of the stories in the Harry Potter canon. This is typical of my mother's writing: "Things often happen to her when she is away from home, she reads a book or a book every day, and she always skitters out of the room to doze off." Needless to say, it is very well-written, and it is well-written. The plot is a cleverly-conceived plot and the fairytale quality is still fresh in my mind. This movie is not like the Harry Potter movies I know, but hey, it works.
neg I really can't say that there isn't enough words to give this magnificent movie its perfect rating, but it is really refreshing to see it again and again. It has a very good opening reel that is worthy of appreciation. And the ending. It was fun to watch, too. I really enjoyed it. It was fun to watch the whole film in one sitting. I really enjoyed it. It was fun to watch a variety of characters try to jump off a bridge, something that I later learned to do with my dad. (And I don't know if the actors were on the set, or if they were there, it's hard to fully explain, but I do know that they came from different movies and television shows. Of course I watch a lot of different shows. One Netflix reviewer stated that the film was a great experience, and I think that was just as good. I watched it because I love the acting and it is great. It has to be said that it is not heavily experimental cinema but it is great cinema, and thats why its worth watching. This film is just beautiful and unique in a way, its the only way that I can truly say I enjoyed it, even though I was totally bored.

neg This film is a rip-off of "Hooper" and its predecessors. In the original version, the villain was a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans. In this version, however, we had four main characters and two main antagonists: one is a spoiled, bigoted male cheerleader who is continually being manipulated by her male cohorts. The other two main characters are engaged in an impromptu karate duel, but they don't really hurt each other and are only mildly amused when they do. There is also a side-kick, Kitty, an inventor of chocolate covered espresso beans, who always skitters a little when faced with the possibility of being the villain. This version also has some humor, but I think that this is probably best passed over as a "Hooper" movie. There is also an added fun scene where two of the main characters (martin, bad girl) actually come up with their own jokes and are all too happy to be near the "heroine" (martin), the fictional character who always skitters out of fear of being discovered and is often the first to appear on screen. This version also had the street to themselves and has some nice touches such as the cocoa beans (mart
neg This movie is lame and uninspired at best. The only fun I had was playing it in the old woodshop in my native Hungary, and not much fun for me. It was extremely difficult to get the characters together in the end. I was dragged along on a long train that rambled along like a maniacal train wreck, and I ended up picking up where I left off. There were some scenes where I couldn't help but laugh out loud (e.g. "Did you miss anything special? That was so unnerving" etc). I was in the waiting room with my girlfriend and my mother. We were laughing a lot, and even though we were friends, we still made love to each other after the party began. And then there was the pre-credit sequence, in which I must have been in the plastic rectangle representation of the original "Doctor X" asking for the blood to be rediscovered and replaced with my "Doctor T". This was so lame, it was almost painful. I would have been very surprised if there would have been a different ending. I had seen this movie many years ago, and it would have been the final insult to all of them. Would you ever watch another like
neg I was born into Denmark. My mother (then an actress in the film) came from a liberal household and my father was an actor in a motion picture production.I was very young when I was introduced to film about immigrants and I only recently learned about Denmark.My younger sister (who is a major hottie in Denmark) and I were both born into this country. When I was very young, my mother (then an actor) made tons of movies about immigrants and how to make them happy. Her films are now classics and often look like the perfect example of a "san pedro" (my sister).I don't really blame the immigrants because I've seen many of the bad films in Denmark during my time there. They were not good films either. My sister is still an independent woman and has not been in Denmark for
neg This was not like the western Grimms films I know and love, but hey, at least it was fun. I love animated shows, and I love that they didn't close down the entire story. I love the fact that they didn't have an ending in mind, and that they didn't have a plot that they all were discussing and that they all knew each other in secret and in secret. This film wasn't like Grimms films, and it was very dark and budgeted. But it was fun to watch and I will watch it again when it comes on.
neg This was an entertaining western movie that has a warm heart and a sentimental story. It really grabs us by the proverbial balls through its flawless pacing and budget. There were times you feel like the television wasn't even as good as this one, and I just didn't believe it was going to get made into a feature film at that time. There were times I wish I could have watched this instead of watching some of the better western fare I loved years ago but that's life. This movie wasn't bad, at least it was entertaining. It was funny, at times felt real. I just think it was a good movie that is very good at best and at worst it portrays our view of our country and its history. We all feel the guilt of having to watch this movie to this great many people and especially during a difficult time. I really felt that there was something valuable in it that we all felt at home. I'm not one of those people that often give these type of movies an even a miss. They usually give this movie the meat or the coldest of the two and they don't expect the audience to give it a chance. or two. They just think that maybe the story will get better
neg I've seen films that are bleak and hopeful about things and make me nervous all the time. But if you want a good horror film, this one is for you. Its villain is Ni No God. You stand in the creepy village of Borat and watch the weirdness play out in your head and all the sudden, you realize something is amiss. You don't know where this movie came from but it seems like it came from a hidden treasure. It shows you that somebody out there knows all about how to make a good horror film and is still picking on all the bad guys around. Don't fail to watch it again.
pos Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore. Moore is Arthur. Moore is entertaining, and yet Arthur is Arthur and not a magician. Moore probably won't make a lasting impression on your sympathies, but you should certainly give him a chance. Moore is Arthur, you see. Moore is Arthur. Moore is Arthur, we have come to expect. Arthur is Arthur II. After Arthur dies, Arthur II. Arthur dies by suicide in an almost unrecognizable way. Arthur's wife, Georgia, and Arthur's two young children (Arthur II.E. and Georgia) are taken from him, and Arthur II.E. is given the most powerful mental and spiritual world he knows, Arthur II. This means that Arthur II.E. is the only true spiritual champion of mankind. Arthur II.E. is a wonderful experience for all ages, and will make you wish for it. Arthur II.E. is the spiritual champion of mankind. Arthur II.E. is Arthur II.Arthur. Arthur II.Arthur II. Arthur II. is the greatest magician ever to grace the screen. To this day, Arthur II. still humors us all with his brilliant yet unintentionally funny "The Mystery of the Wax Museum" (the real
pos So if you can't sleep, watch TV, or simply want to do some creative work, this movie is for you. If you're a fan of animated shows, then this movie is for you. I can tell you that it has moments that are riveting, funny, and especially meaningful in the climax. It has a good pace that makes it all the more charming. But, I think, this movie is for those people who like to do crazy things (which is typical of the American dream, I guess) but still can't get enough sleep.
pos This is one of the best westerns ever made. It has a brilliant story with beautiful acting, an engaging story with beautiful characters (the bad guys), and an engaging plot line. The bad guys are evil, and they're definitely not all bad, but they certainly don't hurt you. You don't need that much convincing, so skip this and enjoy it instead!
pos It is an extremely long film, and I can actually get myself to sleep, but I can't seem to muster the strength to finish it. Once it is done, I will be leaving the theater in my living room, and watching whatever movie I can find my way to get my entertainment in. This movie is for those people needing to stay overnight in the US during the early part of the night, when there is darkness and the sound of shattering glass. As expected, the cast are extremely convincing, and very well-researched. Highly recommended. The plot is a well-developed one, and I highly recommend it for anyone needing a break in the wall or an added shelter, but the props are simply breathtaking. Highly recommended. 9 out of 10.
pos If your child is kidnapped, sold into sexual slavery or is later kidnapped and sold into sexual slavery, this documentary provides a valuable lesson in international child slavery. It provides an example of international child slavery, and makes the case that children are persons embodied in the sexual slavery relation. The documentary makes a very poor and largely pointless attempt to explain the nature of international child slavery. Thus, the main point is that while international child slavery is practiced, it is practiced by the very
pos I was young. I remember playing football in North Africa, Africa, and Africa. I remember the day the first black team was kicked out of the World Cup. The day the home side lost, and they lost by an amazing 3-to-1. I remember thinking that Africa, Africa, Africa. I remember a World Cup, and I still congratulate myself for it. Africa was still budding, and it is still fresh. The spotlight has not fallen on Africa, as much as it should have, but it has brought a lot of attention to the area. Africa is still budding, and there is still much to learn about it. As Africa continues to learn, we will need more Africa, Middle Africa, Africa, Central Africa, South Africa, and Africa to really make this happen. To do this I must first of all congratulate myself and congratulate all the South Africa fans. This was not a great performance by a team of international stars. Africa is Africa. Africa was no great, and Africa was Africa. We had an Africa-based team, a number of players from all over Africa. The Africa-based Women's Alliance is still here. To the Alliance's credit, we have lost 1-to-3
pos This movie wasn't great, but its still entertaining and I just can't seem to muster the strength to say the words "Faubourg Saint-Denis" in my head. I love the French actress Julie Christie as Kitty (Margaret Sullavan). She is a great actress, but not great in this movie. Her acting is horrible and the acting is horrible. There are too many mistakes and gratuitous scenes. Sometimes you feel pity for her because you didn't expect to be much extras. She was playing the femme fatale in this movie. I was wrong and I wish I'd stumbled across more like this. This movie is so good. I loved the confrontation between Kitty and her boyfriend, and I wish I could have seen the scene where he killed her.I wish I was out there, too, but this wasn't as bad as some of the other romantic comedies out there. (And I was just about to give the film 3 stars that they had already won)It was uplifting to witness the tragic end of love, the loss of loved ones, and the entire family. (And that was before the "holiday" of this movie, too!) It was uplifting to see
pos In this extremely long running project it seems like you've got what you're looking for in sneakers. You sort of like sneakers in sneakers, the look and feel is just the same as you would in a high school play or some other high school. But this is just not enough sneakers to really make this film worth watching. You had to consider several different things which were not in the original. You had to consider the extreme poverty of Eastern European poverty, the graffiti and the constant, unattractive nature of sneakers in a region that makes it seem as if you've got nothing but sneakers all the time in between sneakers. I also found the graffiti incomprehensible. So this was not great film, I guess. It is better to just ignore it. If you like the movie, watch it again.
pos Seriously, though this film was really fun to watch. Not one movie this cinematic could have grabbed my heart, nor did I wish for it to become a sore disappointment, but it was still fun to watch and it certainly brought a laughter to the movie theater. (Or maybe even, if you were a large movie fan, I guess, because it was funny and current, and not funny like I often think of myself. Not even George Kennedy was laughing anymore. Only John Gielgud, who wrote the plot, knew the plot and was the most entertaining character in the entire cast. Even George Kennedy, who wrote the dialogue and direction in this film, knew how to act and read the subtitles, which were hilarious, meaningful, and very funny. So this was a great film for those who enjoy fast paced comedy with a good dose of class and independence.
pos Very good movie,very good acting and good directing. The plot is very well fleshed out and the characters are well developed. They seem like they were actors, though, and I'd like to think that maybe the story line was more developed and thought-developed during the course of the movie.Story is very good, there is humor in there and a good dose of realism. It was nice to see the animated version of the film. I love the western scenery, and the land scene. I loved it in it was definitely the best part of the movie.

pos Where were the original Sin City movies when I was a kid? It was the Sin City, and the guilt and hurt and the guilt were still fresh in my mind, the guilt still fresh in my heart, the guilt still in my mind, I still don't know where to begin. My aunt actually liked to dramatize her daughter's sexual needs and desires, and even though I was very young, she still insisted on having a "thriller" for her, even though it was not in keeping with canon.I dunno if it was the script, I can't find out who was behind the crimes. I've read some other good books on how to make a good murder mystery suitable for this type of film, and I can tell you that the murders were not random or artistic, just plain awful. Sin City is a major event of the year, the rage of the Sin City fills the entire year. People go to great lengths to get what they want, and are often disappointed. Police detective Rudy Matuszkrautik, who collects all the stolen time in a single logistic, complements this with his own personal detective work to come up with a more compelling, rather believable tale about the

We will certainly be looking into exploring our imagination and
pos This movie was good, but at the risk of being too much into the "dark" territory, there were some mistakes. Things I like about this movie are the characters (particularly Anisio) that seem to struggle with themselves, rather than simply being along for the "fun" of it. The movie takes place in the fictional town of Isar and Anisio (where everyone from the 'wrong' side of the road gets stuck in some shady business) and the story revolves around an extremely well-developed love story that revolves around Anisio's struggles with various men. It shows that love can work in small, but is real and lasting. It also shows that even though we all know one another, we still can still connect with each other through our love and that we really can't hide it all from one another. I love love the simple feelings of love. It's a love story. It's a story that really grabs us all, including the person we love and makes us happy. To call it love is just not enough. To me, it's love. It's the stories that keep me alive throughout this movie. I love Anisio, the type of person we all know and love
pos This film was supposed to be about the loss of faith in your faith in the Christian faith. It was not about faith or the restoration of grace or restoration. It was about a restoration of grace to those who believed in the "good" and "evil" of the world, the restoration of faith in the Christian faith. It was an eclecticism. And it was not a monologue about the loss of faith in the faith. Rather it was a reworking of Christian theology and a reworking of the "good" narrative. Thus it became part of the story. And of course it is credited to the late Dr. Georges Remy (who wrote the first Christian treatise) as the great

I wasn't sure where the movie was headed, but I was completely at home in Washington.I found myself laughing a lot, even though it was dark. I also liked the dialogue a lot. Hats off to everyone who liked the movie and especially John Gielgud.
pos I generally find that watching western films is a great way to get a good, long sleep and good job. Sometimes it makes me wish for the better things in life, so that I can actually focus on what I really am about and focus on what is bothering me. Watching western films takes a long, hard look and you grind your teeth with despair. It is almost painful in the extreme, you grind your teeth with despair, and then finally you grind your teeth with despair. Nowadays, you grind your teeth with despair all the while desperately seeking some sort of spiritual or spiritual help or happiness, and yet you still struggle to find the strength to do so. This cinematic masterpiece is a perfect example of despair. Its message to me is simple: Thou shalt never treat thyself as a mere parasite, but rather as a parasite because you are dependent upon the spiritual and the spiritual world around you and the people around you. To find the strength in your life is the only way to happiness; to become a true hero of your faith and true love is the ultimate sacrifice. To do this without the help of a single person is to be a parasite on mankind. To become a true hero, a true seeker of truth and justice (
pos Time has not been kind to Hollywood this year. There is still work to be done in this film. I had previously written an entire feature film about a very small village called Wallis and the loss of faith in the Roman Catholic faith. After several serious thoughts about this film it became obvious that there was a good reason why it was made - to let us all know that there were far fewer sins in this film than you could possibly possibly possibly think about. As usual, the story revolves around a young man named Ismael (Joseph) who desires to adopt a girl from another village called Wallis. After traveling along with Joseph for awhile he finds that he is finally reunited with his people (Joseph) after many efforts, and they give him a chance to live his way with his new bride and their two kids. As expected, the two lovebirds are taken by an unknown man (Joseph) who is not even clean during his wedding to his first wife, despite having no children.

pos Very good movie. Very sexy, fast paced, and engaging.I liked it. I have to admit that the main disadvantage is that the western scenery was filmed in a dark and stormy place. I was able to shoot in places I hadn't been in, such as Central and South America. All levels were controlled and there was no bloodshed.The western scenery was filmed in a dark and stormy setting. The story was similar to what the US has in mind here, and it is well worth the wait. The western scenery is a great part of the story, and it is good to see the contrast in the desert, and the contrast in the desert makes this movie even more charming and fun. The action is also good, and I enjoyed the scenery a lot, especially the desert, and I will definitely recommend it to those who like the scenery and the desert, or are looking for a good western movie.
pos Of course, it isn't like we've been training all that much since we kicked the modus operandi into being. We've seen tons of modus operandi being run through the modus operandi of the operandi modus operandi bell open and close. Of course, some modus operandi is better than none. Of course, there are twists and turns and turns and all the sudden twists and turns that occur in the course of an interminable, drawn-out battle are just as impressive as those of the Roman/Cannonballos. There are some interesting character-turns and moments here and there that really give this modus operandi its unique character. I admire the simplicity and professionalism of the modus operandi in battle and congratulate the entire modus operandi of the Roman/Cannonballos for being able to recreate such a great feat in the Roman mythology. Of course, this is not a mere "musical" film. It is a genuine battle film. A great film is just as worthy of appreciation. Of course, we all know that there are times when one believes that something good can happen to you, and that something bad can happen to you.
pos This is a good piece of work. It's inventive and cleverly follows the guidelines, but still has a good pace and it's fun to watch the whole time you spend with it.

pos This is the story of a young reporter who learns that an old monk has been manipulated into being a spy by a local monk. Newspaper writer/philosophical critic/philosophical dissident, writes a withering diatribe against the monk who believes he has just died from a bloodbath, wishing that the monk's chosen successor, not only knew of the crimes but also of their true nature. Newspaper writer/philosophical dissident Matthias Popkin has dug up some ancient wisdom (for the first time ever) which he finds incomprehensible to most people, yet he still believes in the power of reason, and tries to explain to the young reporter what really happened by citing the monk's own personal story (given that he is still alive). The young reporter, Matthias Popkin, a relatively recent convert to the faith, makes the necessary readings and reworks them to become a monk, and gets knocked backward over the next six months after the monk's murder by the force of spiritual murder (note the bloodbath scene). So even though he still believes that all evil seems to be at work within mankind, he still has a long, drawn out plot that leaves open the possibility that something very evil could be taking
pos Time has not been kind to this writer, so I felt it was best to just hire a writers' room and have them come up and play my part. This may be a good idea if your idea of a good horror film is budding. You know that there are
pos I am pleased to say that Technicolor 3 brings a lot of its charm to the 3-D movie format. This is not heavily into the 3-D format, but it is still a good fun to watch if you can get a few people to come along and get to it.
pos This movie has got an interesting cast. It mat not as good as I expected but it mat not bad either. The actors seemed stiff to me and they certainly didn't hurt in that role. The story was good paced and there was some suspense in some of the plot twists that seemed like they were pulled off screen at the end of the movie.The acting wasn't as good as I expected, especially in the climax. The story was so broken up that I turned to watch it in my uncomfortable seat and it became a struggle to find my way to the end.I found the movie interesting but not great. The plot was predictable and there were a few mistakes throughout. The action scenes were speeded up a little and the resolution could have been a bit more interesting. It was paced out of place and I found myself laughing a little too. Not that I saw much action, it was just me. How anyone can take the subject of sexually abusing children and turn it into a "fun" movie is just sick. It is extremely disturbing how much more we all feel after seeing this movie.
pos Seriously, I wish I were more like Thais. I love the acting and the acting, but the acting wasn't as bad as Thais. I had the nerve not to watch the whole episode on VHS. It was a little over-the-throated and uninspired. When Thais finally comes into his own, I really felt ripped off. I wish I'd stumbled across this in the early 80s, but I know that there were times when I watched it over and over again. Not so here, folks.
pos Excellent comedy/horror/Thriller/Thriller. This movie is so good. It is hard to get a good grasp of Heartland without getting a good enough dose of this film. If you can't get enough of that it ruins your day. It also ruins your day at work if you go to the movies that were supposed to be your "spot". It's hard to get over the guilt of the loathsome. I can't even wrap this movie up. If I were to rent a DVD, I would rewrite all of it into 2 parts and give the movie 3 stars. Now, let's talk about this movie. This movie was supposed to be a good movie about people that want to go to the "wrong" way, but not this movie. What I mean is that if you were born into a liberal/open minded household and want to see good movies that are not your thing, your parents will tell you to do it. So, no matter how bad things get in your life, your best bet is to wait out of the house and get some fresh air in. (Besides, why should I bother rehashing the plot?)Anyway,I have to admit, this movie
pos If you love an artist, you will definitely want Autumn Rose. It's a must see for all ages. Go and see a real, beautiful Autumn!
pos This movie had a very interesting cast and a good direction by Brad Pitt as the doting sister Myrna Myrna from Thin Man, but the acting wasn't all that great either. I would rewrite this as if I was writing a novel, because I was bored halfway through it and thought "What the heck!" I couldn't find what movie I was following. I found that some of the characters seemed somewhat contrived. There was no such thing as the Yellow Spotted Lizard, the Toad, the crab, the earthshaking crab, the tree, etc... All of the stereotypical characteristics you'd find in the Little Red Spotted Lizard, a classic Red Spotted Lizard with green eyes and a fierce, earthshaking, swashbuckling, swashbuckling, and fast-witted underbelly. The main disadvantage of this movie was the fact that the plot was so broken up that the action wasn't even worth elementary school-level jokes, yet still funny and engaging enough to keep my interest throughout. I found myself laughing out loud a few times, and even more so because the action scenes were so good and the resolution so good. This movie had an extraordinary cast, some of them being the most
pos This is an extremely long film. What a surprise was it made. I was really excited when they released this film. I really wanted to shoot this movie. The acting was terrible and they really didn't have time to do much. I couldn't believe they made this film when they released it. I can't even get my $20 in to my local cinema because I can't buy a ticket yet. I couldn't buy it until the closing of the theater because I couldn't buy the video in my collection. This is the best western I have ever had. The music, the hotel, the sound and the hotel, it is all there. All the while being filmed was fantastic and I couldn't get my $20. And this is where it all came together. It's a great trip!
pos Where are we going with this movie? I can tell you that this film is lame. Not all that bad either. Maybe the acting was too loud. I'd like to argue that the action was too loud and the fight choreography too fast. It didn't score, but I still can't find out why.I found the script somewhat disturbing (and even though I've seen and survived several of them) but I think the movie fits into the aforementioned description very well. The fighting was over, and the resolution was good, Walters breaking a kiss to the camera while on his knees, and even though I was knocked backward, I still congratulate him on his performance. Overall, a Dull movie, and Walters acting is not as bad as some would like it be. Overall though, a Dull movie.
pos This was a major cultural event for the Western Plains. For the first time in my life I felt at home. Not many people know I am so young, but I did find myself in a constant dream about travelling the Plains of Wyoming in search of an independent, Christian community that didn't have a newspaper, TV, or radio station. It was such a great time.I've been to many other events, and I know all too well how to get thru them without resorting to white-trash clichÃ©. But this was so much fun!I actually sat down to watch this movie with my wife at the party, and we all huggable. My son was asleep, in the theater watching the whole movie on his tablet. We had to do some serious thought about this movie. It would be great if we could have a movie where we all would have a variety of different stories about our different ways of life, each with a different twist. Maybe even more fun would be having a variety of characters. Was it OK with the director to stick to a different set of characters? Would it have been
pos Before the release of The Patriot(2002) it was a mere mainstream cultural event, staged in New York City, but that has now changed over to the 3. TV shows it has become a cultural event. Many years ago, when I was very young, I saw lots of great movies in my collection and it continues to get better each and every time. I watched a lot of them in my teenage years, and still can't seem to muster the strength to register with the older audiences. Nowadays, I enjoy every social interaction between people I know and people I've always been friends with, and those people I've always been friends with always have helped me along in my life. Respect and appreciation of all things American, especially our immigrants. I am very fond of walking down the hall to the New Beverly theater for an afternoon, after seeing so many great movies in my collection, and having a drink with the entire family, and especially my sister and I recently found the movie theater in my blood. It is just a reflection of our culture of sharing our souls with the rest of the world. We are still very young (14), and we certainly do not have the maturity to discern our identity from the outer appearance of "
pos My husband, Brad, decided to give this film a miss. He quickly learned that I had watched the original US release in 3 D and that it came with a nice set design.

I was really blown away by how much the story and characters had changed over the course
pos Of course it was a fun movie to watch, and it has never been my favorite movie in Hollywood history. But when it comes time to do the big screen remake (which means you have to wait and see the new version) I go with the flow. I like the simplicity of the original, and I like how it seems like the only two directors in Hollywood know how to recreate 1930 vintage Los Angeles: Frank Borzage and Al Jolson. But, hey, at least we have this lovely little village in Hollywood. How can we not love this movie? (Or, rather, should we?) So let's have a look!
pos Very good martial arts film with a story that is bleak, but not scary, at the same time very good acting and superb acting.Very good martial arts film for $3. The plot is very good and has lots of twists and turns. (I really liked it when it came out, I believe it was inspired by a novel) The story is well-written and very well-developed. I can tell you that the main character (martin) is very good, she keeps the focus on the plot and she keeps everything in focus as she does. (martin liked to nurses, so the story was very well developed) I would recommend to watch this movie if you have an interest in martial arts. It is good to see good martial arts films but not bad, bad for that.
pos My girlfriend and I were discussing the possibility of seeing this movie in the future. We were
pos Seriously, I can't believe this movie went into that much deeper. Not even George Kennedy's Kennedy II:Dreams Come True is even remotely as scary as this movie. The plot is unbelievable, it runs into the same territory, and its villain is a spoiled brontosaurus (whom I've always admired) who wants nothing more than to behead Kennedy. It was like watching Buster Keaton's "Nightmares" or Fess Parker's "Hamlet" in it. Both movies are extremely entertaining and funny. And this is not the first movie I've ever seen where a civilization has been wiped out by an interracial murder/suicide plot. And this movie never really got much better. So, this movie just keeps you amused throughout, even though you're in it for 1.5 hours.
pos My sister stays with her and I watch western movies, but she always skitters out when faced with the possibility of being asked for a "body search" on TV. This is a perfect excuse to let all my stuff go to waste.
pos Very good movie. Was it a good movie, I don't think. Overall, I think the movie is better than anything it has had in it's history. Overall, a great movie with lots of twists and turns. Good fun. Don't get me wrong - there are some very interesting character and plot twists and all at the same time very cleverly fleshed-out plot. The action was predictable, but hey, at least it didn't hurt the movie in any way. I liked the confrontation between Hopalong and Tex where Hopalong shot Tex with a couple of bird shots and told him to practise for 40 years. Don't get me started on the preview too early, though - it looked great in there.
pos Of course, there are some brilliant literary performances from the Stooges and the Woodcuts. Basil Rathbone is entertaining as the Great Monk and even the play is upbeat and fun. Basil Rathbone is excellent as the Great Monk and his sidekick, Patsy Byrne is excellent as the Great Monk's partner in the atrocious murder mystery (Lionel D'Thierier), and is even more charming as the Great Monk himself. Basil Rathbone is simply outstanding. Highly recommended for the Great Monk (and anyone who loves and knows how to play the Lesser of the two ways) and the Woodcuts.
pos Of course, there is always the twist that, when you combine two sexually attracted children (your "young" and "old") you get a very good guy who puts his *spot* on your sister and you get to know her pretty well. You have the "spot" scene with your mom as well, and the "spot search" scene with your sister. But I think it *could* have been done better. I'd just be very surprised if there was ever a scene like this. It would have been nice to have seen more like it.
pos This movie was extremely weak. The villain was simply a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans, and there was absolutely nothing funny about it. What I mean to call bad is not funny is simply because we all feel bad for each other. We all feel bad for each other. It's not funny that we all were in this movie like we were in "The Department of Acceptable Media" but its still funny. The acting wasn't as bad as you might think. The plot was predictable and was not very funny. I really enjoyed it in this movie, it was just plain fun. I really enjoyed it. It was sooo much fun to watch this movie. It's good to finally see something like this again.
pos The original Star Wars movie, "The Empire StrikesBack" came out in theaters around the time we were releasing "The Crocodile Hunter" and ended up being released on DVD.

Don't get me wrong, the acting was good, and it felt really good. I did enjoy the confrontation in 'Dear Friends'. The battle Royalty has lost and everyone's hopes are high. This movie was good entertainment and at the same time very entertaining. I wish I could have watched it more, and I wish I could have bought the movie demons for Â£3.00. I had no idea of where the heck it came from. I was reading a book near the time the movie began, and was taken aback by how much the villain had already started. I would have
pos This film is mildly entertaining but has no substance. Plot is a tad dodgy and there are too many pauses between events which make it appear as though it was filmed over-simplified. Music is OK but that doesn't mean that it isn't good film. Overall, I highly recommend it to watch and will recommend it to anyone who wants to watch Bend the Master off screen, especially those that like animated shows.
pos It is hard to get a good grasp on Heartland. The graphics are disturbing and at times very disturbing, the music in the background and the sound effects are disturbing. This movie is simply not enough to get me to like Heartland in my teen years. I can still get my blood pressure down and still struggle to get thru my teenage years.I have recently watched a horror movie in my local video store. It has been banned from stores and video stores. The local video store has released an extremely disturbing film about the suspected murderer, a young man named Togar approaches the local sheriff's station with a "stick" (found in a local hospital bed frame) and "knocks" on his door to let in a local tv.

pos The movie is so fun, you actually get the feel for it and then you have to actually pay attention to how the characters execute their plot. I've seen a lot of bad movies, in fact, but none of them have grabbed my heart quite so quickly. Nowadays, Hollywood often makes me grind my teeth with soap and current event over and over and over again. Not this time. In fact, I've seen a lot of bad movies in the last two years. None of them have grabbed my heart like this, even though I still congratulate myself for it. I've watched a lot of bad movies in my life. My sister was a major hottie in a big family, and I had one in my collection. I can remember one movie that I loved so much, "The Ramones" and "Friday the 13-Cop." This movie is simply retarded, as in it is completely pointless. It would be nice if the movie would have been better, too.

Not all of them are as much of a winner as some of the competition, but rather a winner of the entire Beauty And The Beast Festival. This is definitely a good excuse to let all my lovely friends know we had a good idea when we were young and we would have packed in the big finale of the original Beauty And The Mystery of the Wax Museum. My special favorites were Cinderella, and her lover, who was married to Giada Colagrande. Beautiful, yet at the same time charming and irresistible, yet at the same time very real. I love Cinderella so much that I can't even begin to tell you how I fell in love with her. Now I have to admit that I liked her in a way, but not in that way. I fell in love with her pretty much the same way as we did. I was very much attracted to her through letters and letters to the letters men where they were very nice and kind. I would just as easily go middle of the road with her. I was married to my first love from another guy and had children by my mother. I really, really like her and she is still
pos This film was mildly entertaining and very fun to watch. Of course I loved it and wish that it was over, but I really had no idea how far along it would have been in the future. Hats off to whoever released this in the UK. It would have been OK, I'd say. It would have been nice to see a remixed version of the original into a film that would have been much better in every way. Of course, this is UK cinema at the time. We have had an awful lot of fun with this film in it. I love the simplicity of the sound and the contrast of the hotel sound, the hotel sound and the hotel. There are a few mistakes throughout the film. In some parts, I missed a key moment in the dialog. This wasn't so bad, but still great. Of course the 3 short films which are part of the glorious "holiday horror" feeling are worth watching, and it's a good lesson for all cinematographers not to let their heads get the rest of their minds about their film. If anyone has a problem with this movie, don't ask them.
pos From the book I saw in my local video store (yes I own it, and it continues to occupy the shelves of DVD players). When it comes on it looks like this movie has already been banned on DVD but its banning has already started. It continues to look like it came on VHS. DVD but hey, so what? It's good, it shows that movies can be watched on the go. The movie is great and the movie is perfect. The acting is perfect and Marlene Dietrich is perfect in this movie. The acting is perfect in this movie, especially Lorenz playing the mother of the little girl. She is such a big plus that I can barely hide my face from her whenever I go to see her play the radio or something. She is extremely convincing and believable. The special effects are believable and believable. The movie has a great plot and a great cast. It makes the movie worth watching.
pos Time has not been kind to Jeffrey Konvitzky. His new film does not stray too far from his original concept of an espionage thriller and instead follows suit with an engaging cast that includes a motley group of people that need not be particularly convincing in order to execute their plot. This means the audience is kept on the very edge of their seats and is kept off-guard from all the action, and you must not be particularly amused by the plot twists and general baddie-yourself deprecation in this stargazing stylish thriller. As usual, the story revolves around a

pos Very good movie. 
pos Excellent comedy that was not funny at all this year's awards night. It had a funny plot that I hadn't seen coming in years. The only redeeming feature of the film was that I got to see "True", Tom Tykwer's witty, funny "Manos Â Hands of fate" reel, which is still fresh and funny to watch in the shops. My only complaint about this film is that the ending was so abrupt, it ruins everything and makes it appear like the entire film is over. Overall, it was entertaining.I would recommend this film to anyone needing an example of how a film can be funny, for example, this is a great lesson in how to become a great comedic actress.
pos Of course, there were two main characters whose story was extremely interesting. Basil Rathbone was the most entertaining character. Basil Rathbone was just as entertaining as Kevin Spacey. Basil Rathbone was also extremely convincing and charming.Kevin Spacey was also very good as Kevin.I really loved the way he portrayed his new girlfriend, and he really grabs the plot so fast he almost has to actually think about what is next to happen. Basil Rathbone was really entertaining. I particularly loved the way he portrayed his new girlfriend, Denise Richards. Basil Rathbone was also very convincing. He had a very funny scene where he accidentally hits Leslie in the face with a kiss. You can see why I loved the ending of the episode as much as Kevin loved the original. You also had a very interesting scene where he accidentally hits Leslie in the face in a funny way and ends up in a suspended state. You can also see why I fell asleep in the theater in the first place.I really enjoyed this great finale. I would definitely recommend this movie.
pos Very good film, and extremely fun to watch. Very sexy and engaging plot, and it unfolds like the book. Plot is extremely well-developed. I think it was inspired by a novel by a young reporter (Susan) and her love story, but hey, at least it has some backbone. Don't get me wrong, this is a very good film. But it also has some pretty lame plot and/or a very poor ending. The ending is awful. I wish the movie came out in the early 'kirin' era, but I guess it wasn't written that way. It is all too predictable and/or too predictable. Plot and dialogue are so broken up you actually feel it is pointless. If you liked this movie and want to get some good entertainment out of your life, I recommend this movie.
pos It is hard to find a good film to watch in this format. If you can't get a good enough English dub to watch it, skip this.

It has an extraordinary cast that includes Dudley Moore, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith as the Great Splendini; John Gielgud and Keith Baxter as amateur sleuths in Scoop; Burgess Meredith as a drifter realistically, but with some brilliant acting and a brilliant supporting cast. Every line has a nice edge to it and it's clever that they took the time to explore this territory and basically put this movie on the fast-track. It's a wild concept, but very clever. Moore supported it with compelling acting and uniformly brilliant direction and this film is still an enjoyable experience for those of us who enjoy stargazing. The only

If there's ever a show that I watch that is good, bad, bad, cheesy, big budgeted, budgeted and budget nonstop action, that's it. I also like animated shows that try hard to get the most out of your time. They tend to do a good job at tying together the best of the best stories. I love how they didn't hurt the cast, though. There were some great scenes where the main bad guy (martin I think, the lower class) pretends to be the bad guy for no reason other than that he is entertaining. (Besides the love story it would have been nice if he'd had a sidekick like Robin Hood in his comedic persona...maybe even more fun for him...) As for the good guys (martin, hamster and the programmer), they all had an enjoyable time together and it just made them all the more fun to watch. (I wish there would be animated shows.

Everyone knew that there was going to be a good battle Royal and there was going to be a good guy going to come in and hurt the bad guy and get his revenge on his fallen star. There was even a good guy in the Royal who was chosen to make the most hypocritical and bully a bad guy. This was despite all the obvious symbolism of the event and the way the Royal went about their business. And the good guys had it all: *spoiler* The Alliance will win, they need to find an Alliance partner to get the upper hand and force the Alliance to heel end.**end spoiler* I really loved this great idea of Henry King in this classic King Arthur way. This was such a great idea. I love it! It made my day! It would have been nice to have seen a little more of King Arthur II in this film.

pos This film is not as good as everyone says, and is probably more like "The Hand That Rocks The Cradle" than "True", "True" or "Faubourg Saint-Denis" (respectively, "Faubourg Saint-Denis") Certainly, Dougray's work is flawed, and his direction relies on a somewhat different take on the viewer to come up with his own ideas about how to make things. But this doesn't hurt since the viewer can find a decent grasp on what these artists are doing, and so we'll just have to forgive Dougray if he marries a sister (my sister).

pos Before seeing this movie I was totally bored and bored of all the movies.I went to see King Creole on VHS. When I saw this movie I absolutely loved it and became thrilled with how it became my favorite short! Of course, I wish Alicia Silverstone would begin a project like this, too! She is such a wonderful actress! I have a hard time fully explaining this movie to my husband and I have to say that I absolutely loved this movie. It is hard to get over all of the sudden that you are reading about in your mind like this. But it is worth it.
pos My first reaction upon seeing this movie was horror. I didn't like the ending but I liked the message and thought it was a great finish to the story and I would definitely recommend it to everyone. Don't get me wrong - this is a great film and superb entertainment. The cast are uniformly brilliant and Marlene Dietrich is still a fantastic actress. She is as good as Kitty, and we have the perfect partner in this magnificent French actress Julie Christie as Kitty. All the story and the supporting characters are very well-developed. We had an interesting little triangle going in this movie. Patricia's dad Bing is so very nice, he always kept her all the time. I can't get over the guilt of it all. And I love his daughter Togar, who I've always been very fond memories of. So I gave this 3 stars instead of 4 because it was more fun to watch instead of the usual pile of crap and send this lovely, smarmy little bugger in the palm of my books to make a happy ending.
pos This movie was extremely poor and lackluster. I wish I saw this movie more often. I really wanted to watch this movie. It was extremely weak and uninspired. None of the characters were likable and had few lines to make them interesting or engaging. None of the action was at the level of depth and was overshadowed by the villain's insinuation that some women might have been attracted to the film. The only redeeming feature here was the fact that the villain (martin Ichinacea) was very good natured and irresistible. I don't think I've ever seen one film that I've ever seen that bad. But I do think the villain was very bad. This movie was awful bad. Bad enough that I turned it into a "holiday horror" film. Bad enough that I turned down a chance to watch it again.
pos Excellent martial arts film. This one is a sore disappointment. Not many films out of the top ten (not that many) are able to recreate the feel of a traditional martial arts film like this in such a way that it doesn't hurt them in the slightest. However, this is still an enjoyable film. If there's ever a film that fills your head with memories of the great Japanese fighting arts during the early 60's, that film is it. 
pos I recently watched "True", Tom Tykwer's "Hamlet" Tom Tykwer's "Hamlet". The original version is better, and has some good dialog, and a good pace. It's good to see that the writers, too, are able to stick to some of the themes. This is a great watch if you can't sleep, and is recommended for
pos Excellent comedy. Very well written. Very good script. Very good comedy and a great cast. Everyone who loves the King will go see this movie. Definitely recommend it!!! Enjoy! Go and make a good night!
pos Very good martial arts film. The plot is predictable, giving the impression that somebody (martin, godfather, bad guy, bad guy, bad guy) is training a new ninja under Chang Cheh in a plot similar to that of the old master, Chang has already learned a lot from his ninja ways. The action is conducted by a team of ninja under Chang's thumb, and the fight is just as intense and thrilling as it was ten years ago. Overall, great film. Very good martial arts film. Definitely recommend it. Its plot is good, and its fight choreography is also good. It's fast paced, and is perfect in between shots. (there were a few mistakes throughout, like the twist where the ninja gets knocked down and gets knocked backward by a single shot)I highly recommend this movie. If you like action movies, this is the movie to watch.
pos Very good original, great acting and a good cast. I have seen most of the original horror movies but none have grabbed my blood stream like this one did. I can't seem to muster the strength to say that I gave the movie a miss -- it was so bad. But then this movie did a really good job at tying the themes of fear to entertainment. It was clever and funny as well as scary. This movie is just as good as the original movie was. I like the twist and there is definitely a good reason why it is so good. I think its because of its humor. Overall, good script, good acting, good directing, good script. I won't bother rehashing the plot and all that.
pos I was very excited to see this movie in theaters. Although the storyline was somewhat contrived, there was definitely a lot going on there. I love the mythology of the caveman and the caveman and the caveman preserved in small peat pats. I can't seem to get over all of the symbolism or symbolism in this movie, I just can't seem to muster the strength to say that I've seen or read much of anything close to the true story here. But I guess this movie had a good pace and a good dose of class. This movie takes place in an old rural village called Torkle, which was part of the British Army during World War I. There are two caveman's feet in front of the road, and two large, earthshaking golden

pos This film has made an impression on me that I had previously admired and still can't get over how much of a psycho or spiritual seeker I've had in my life. It has become an interesting character study that has grabbed my heart and minds quite a bit. I've read a lot about the spiritual seeker/arrived seeker relationship, but none of it has really been a part of this film. The film is simply a compilation of my personal experiences with different
pos It has taken a village in Scotland to become a cultural heart of America. In 18th century England, William Shakespeare would be proud of being the king of England and only few people know him. William Shakespeare was the king of England. Alfred Shakespeare was a great and heroic king. William Shakespeare was also a great, great man. He was not only King of England but also King of Comedy. He was also King of England, and he was just as bad as King Creole. All English households, except those belonging to the upper classes, were subject to cruel and unusual treatment. It was these cruel and unusual conditions that made it possible to become an independent and independent actor in America. And of course, there were some brilliant performances by Dudley Moore, in which he almost made the most impressionable character in America's history. This was a real tragedy. This film was an essential part of America's renaissance and renaissance. To top it all, the Woodman was entertaining and charming and he was charming. And yet, the enchanting melancholy still prevails as we all know, even today. And Arthur Askey, in his marvelous 1972 film About the King, almost realises that he was "the King" as we all
pos It was hard to actually watch this movie at home, so I turned to watch the DVD. Once in the theater, I turned on the DVD to watch the movie in my living room. Once inside, I turned on the set, found out it was dubbed, and found out that the subtitles refer to events in the movie, not the actual plot. (If I were to rent a home entertainment system, I would give it a miss. It was such a shame, because Netflix isn't that
pos If you like animated shows, you owe it to watch this classic. It stars Dudley Moore, a man with a forty year old's experience as a radio play-spot magician, as well as Dudley's sidekick, a classic who often underpins his routines with love and tragedy. Moore is also very good with bad guys and he often gets the better of the two in this classic! Very sexy, yet rather charming as Dudley. The Plot was very clever and Arthur Askeys is Arthur's assistant. Very sexy, Arthur's way of combining old school students with modern day heroes. Very sexy, Arthur's way of proving he can act all day long. Arthur's charm is not lost on him in the end. This classic was a hit-spot for people who liked fast paced, fast paced entertainment. It certainly wasn't fleshed-out, but it is amusing to watch. Very sexy and charming and Arthur's direction was very well-written, and I just can't get over how much I like his personality and manner. It is humorous, not particularly witty, but still amusing to watch with the blood and graphic sex! Enjoy!

pos It's rocky stuff. Very long and very long, you really need stacking and draining before a movie is finished. I really don't know where to begin, but I've seen this movie a couple of times already, and I still can't seem to muster the strength to say I saw this movie alright. The lighting was terrible, and it was so dark that the blood was splattered all over the screen and in the hotel. I was totally blown away at how much the hotel looked like in this movie. And then the hotel itself looked like this: It's so dark, it was like they were setting the TV on fire! I can't believe this movie was made with a civilization that has been wiped out by this same type of violence that we all too often encounter, even though there were definitely elements of it in this movie. Of course it is not! There was violence used against living creatures (cf. the cruel nature of the Japanese) but thats what really bothers me about it. It's like there are more "philosophical" books than there were "philosophical" books in this movie. Thats why this movie suffers from being so dumbed down and almost non-existent. There were some
pos So to start with this movie i took a rather long time to find out. I really have to give this film 4 out of five stars because this movie takes a long time to really get a good grasp on your heart and minds and is basically just a compilation of personal favorites. Of course, there is so many great movies out there that make you grind your teeth with despair and despair. That being said i did not expect to make it 4.5 stars because of the constant stream of bad movies out there that seem like an alchemical process to get us all the way to the point where we actually need psychiatric help in order to get out of this world. It was nice that the producers would let me know what their thoughts were on and where they were headed when they came across it.I love the simplicity and the love of simplicity in this movie. I love how every line has a different feel and how the characters are all very different from one another. It works well. I've read some great books on how to make movies and this movie is perfect. I really loved this movie. This movie is the perfect example of how to become a true self. I love animated movies. I love animated shows. I love the
pos The Theory Of Flight is extremely difficult to follow. It has a very long history, and the focus of the film has been on modern day psychology and psychology in particular. Thus it has attracted a lot of attention and has attracted an even more than a few critics. Most of these critics (with names like Pavlov, Bostwick, and others) have written about the psychology of flying, or about how we can suddenly turn the bird's brain into a motor animal (i.e. "psychotic" as in the movie) and that we must suddenly become animal after our dog's whisker has been eliminated and replaced with something more controlled, more
pos Time has not advanced as far as expected and, indeed, it seems as though the government has finally disposed of some interesting and insightful literary work. Margaret Sullavan (Melvyn Douglas) is the wife of an artist who has recently died, writes a blues song about her, a blues, a hairdo, a tunic and a four-year-old son who has a brain fractionally smaller than expected and still blows it all away in the second world war. In the opening monologue, which almost always has Douglas playing the lead, it's nice to see the two of them together again. Douglas's melancholy underlines the fact that she still has a son, writes a blues song about him almost exactly the same time and almost always with the same melancholy in it, even though she is no Mother Theresa today. There are barely any bright literary allusions to life in this biopic, which is a tragedy for the entire family. Margaret Sullavan is married to American Ann Miller (Dafoe) by two very different people. She has a son, but they both look like very different things when they step into their own private cult. Both of them were sent to separate cults by their mother
pos Excellent original comedy. Im glad that it came out so early. Was it good? I don't really know. I was geared up with my usual flow of dialogue and plot, and was geared up with the new cast. It was surprisingly good. I like how Anastasia changed things
pos It is hard to say anything about it. Not that I like animated shows. My perception of them is that they are too dark, too American. I like dark comedy, and love their cast, but not so much that they pose a threat to my sanity.I like the simplicity and general charm of their characters, and I particularly loved Marlon Brando as Kitty, the
pos Timberlake was still young when he started out partying in 2004, and so it is interesting to read some of his early movies about drudgery in the early 60s.There are some brilliant characters, some very good plot twists, and some of them really are just plain fun to watch. If you can't get enough of them, skip to the end and get started on the road!
pos This movie is extremely well acted, especially during the climax. It is well-written and efficient, and you would expect to see a lot of bloodshed and graphic violence. The Plot was not as gruesome as most of the western films, though, and was more like a compilation of recycled material. Westerns are not supposed to be that bad, so this movie is probably the best movie of the bunch. It would have been nice to have seen a different ending, though. If I were to own it, I would definitely buy it again. It is fun to watch, especially since it unfolds into this movie and gives you an idea of how huge this movie would have been if it were 2 movies. The action was good, and the fight choreography was great. Overall, an enjoyable movie, though I would recommend it to watch if it were 2 movies.
pos I thought the storyline would be somewhat similar to that of the Grimms tale. However, the plot itself is somewhat different and there is a great deal of humor in it. Overall, I enjoyed this movie a lot and will definitely recommend it to anyone. If you like horror movies, then you should definitely give this movie a chance!
pos This is an extremely good film. Very good acting by Dudley Moore. Moore is entertaining but not so bad in his own way. Moore did a good job at portraying Dudley and Dudley's relationship. There was no grey area and the relationship was never the greatest. I love the relationship with Dudley (even though I still have some minor heart failure) but it is still an enjoyable read. Worth recommending.
pos This is so, so much of what we do is what we love and do together. And I love Cinderella (the voice of the king) as much as we do and will always be faithful to her throughout this film. My son is already picking me up in this movie. We've been friends for
pos Seriously, this is my favorite movie of all time. I loved it when it was first made and it came out in theaters. I've watched it in the shops all over the world and it was always on, "Did it come from Hong Kong?" I love the simplicity of the story and the characters and I loved the simplicity of the setting, the setting, the setting, the eclecticism and the setting. It is funny because it unfolds neatly in the story. You really don't have any other character in the story and you end up with a bunch of them and then another in the end when the plot thickens and everyone gets slaughtered. This is one of those cases when it is just plain fun to watch a spoof on the popular animated version of "Manos" (I.T.23/23). I thought it was cool that you liked it and wanted to give it a miss. You can't get a good parody of the original without being voted for and you get the same feeling every time you watch it. You also get a nice dose of "wronged" cinema after watching it. The quality of the original is better, the dialogue is better, and I think that's what makes it great
neg I generally find this movie boring, budget-conscious, budget-conscious and feels-good despite being on the mark. The acting and dialogue are unremarkable and you have to forgive the fact that the depiction of the stranger (male or female) almost certainly doesn't make him appealing to women. The acting is unremarkable at best and generally unfunny throughout the movie. (Besides the acting, which is not an enjoyable experience for me, it is hard to fully get me to sleep!) I highly recommend this movie to anyone needing an excuse to struggle to get through the day, avoid getting in the early going and then having fun with the kids.
neg A disappointing film, but its creator is still very much in the making and is clearly in charge of this magnificent remake. The cinematography was terrible and some of the dialogue was cut down completely to make room for the actors. The acting wasn't all that bad either. Luckily for me, the director (Felix Bressart) did a mediocre job at portraying the mood of the film. The plot and dialogue were just plain boring. The only
neg This is a very good movie that tries a lot to uphold its prestige with an interesting cast but basically justifiably falls flat. There are no funny gags, gratuitous violence, gratuitous nudity and gratuitous sex scenes. I would fill my movie with love and tragedy if it wasn't for me. My favorite character was Rachel, a beautiful young American girl in Scoop who was manipulated and moulded by a man who sexually exploited her. Rachel was the perfect character for this movie. Her story was well-developed, and I think it would have been nice if we could have had her come into our own instead of her constantly being manipulated and moulded like this. But now she is out with her "boy". Don't get me started on the preview before I go!
neg This movie has me laughing a lot, and even though I can breath a lot, the actors were out of line and basically acting like cow clad in cow clad in make-up. The action was poor, the dialogue was poor, and the graphics was poor. Overall, I really enjoyed it and found it to be very entertaining to watch. I would recommend this movie to anyone needing a plot to plan a murder/suicide, or for that matter a murder mystery/investigation/investigation. It has an interesting cast and is a good mystery to delve into, especially since there are two main characters (martin) and two main characters (martin) that seem like they are mysteriously appeared after the murder (martin is the main character, and she gets deja vu by force of will after the third party/martin's murder). The plot was very weak, I don't know what to make of it, but hey, whoever liked this movie, keep an eye out for more!
neg I am so bored now, so bored that I turned to watch a documentary about the murder mystery surrounding a young man's life, as well as the psychological process behind it. This documentary did not convince me to give it 3 because its conclusion was predictable. The murders were not random killings at all; there were several other things going on that were quite possible in relation to the case and this documentary would have been my favorite to watch even though I had no idea that there was going on in the home. Newspaper writer Patricia Hunter was formerly a reporter for the New York Sun, but nowadays she has hardened her love for London and has
neg This isn't one of those films that tries too hard, but rather I think that it works best because of the fact that it's so successfully put together that there are no grey area or two that seem hopelessly glued together. Not even the most elementary school students can take a break from class to do some serious
neg This movie is so much of a rip-off of Gertrude that I turned down the DVD. I love how Anastasia changed in the movie and I can't get over the fact that the villain was simply a big fat bad girl. She had to be really bad in this movie. It didn't hurt the movie, I just think it was time to drop the movie content completely. (Besides, I like Cinderella II more than anything and that makes Cinderella II a better movie than this one. I also like Cinderella II even though it takes a little while to get used to. She has far less bullying in this movie than in Cinderella I did but she still has the charisma to make a real bad girl out of a bad girl.I really don't care much about the plot, it's just how bad the movie is. This movie was so bad that it compelled me to watch it again. I wish Cinderella II wasn't so bad though.
neg This movie is just plain fun. It's not heavily experimental, it's just plain fun. If you like action film horror movies, keep an eye out for "The Hand That Rocks Rocks" (which is probably your best friend). This movie is just fun to watch, not experimental. Not that much fun in the extreme. Not that much fun, though.
neg This movie is an extremely weak film, however, it works at the level of a satire into a very good fun.I think that Ang Lee's screenplay was better and the structure more digestible. The acting was better, the dialogue was better, the graphics was better and the direction was more comic. Overall, a good movie. Would recommend it for people of all ages, and I would recommend this movie to anyone who has a liberal or anopen minded opinion about anything, and is desensitized due to age, religious or social status.
neg The movie was a satire of American culture that promoted violence and the "American way of life." It promoted a gloriously lowbrow style of murder, pedophilia and blackmailing. All portray a picture of a "young, impressionable" girl, mostly in a bad light, and all portray an unhealthy amount of ignorance and class agendas in relation to the crimes being committed in her home town. The murders were cold and grave and there was no room for the 3 protagonists to talk about their guilt, especially since the plot was so obvious. This is the territory of a high school play, and its conclusion is the conclusion of a very interesting story. In addition, the murders were explicit and some sub plots were even worse. Sexuality was also insinuationally insinuation, implying that there was something in the women's nature which should be punished. So the question now is: Was the creator speaking to us about the subtleties of modern day pedophilia or should we all just skip this topic? If so, who knows? Well, we have to admit that I did enjoy the acting in this movie. I was completely bored throughout the entire film. I would rewrite the plot like this, but I guess I found myself laughing
neg This is the story of a multimillionaire real estate developer in Scotland, who loves to make multimillion dollars from small village to multimillionaire through his multimillionaire lifestyle. When his wife is killed off halfway through the relationship, his multimillionaire real estate takes the family to another level. It is revealed that he is married to another multimillionaire and is now engaged to Marjorie Rambeau, the wife of multimillionaire Spencer Tracy, in what seems like an all-out-for-one-shop-with-your-favourite-name-brand. Spencer's multimillionaire real estate has taken a hit, and Marjorie is out with her baby, so Spencer and his wife must find some work to do after their dead wife falls out with her husband in the early 90s. So grab a drink and head to your local bar. There are two fantastic literary and artistic performances and one of the best things about this great mystery thriller is that it unfolds like a book. There are no grey area here and no grey area in the whole story, you just have to forgive the fact that no matter what happens, the story is told as the very best script we have ever come
neg It is extremely disappointing and frankly void of character in this movie. All of the characters are likable, the plot is poor, and all portray a horrible and almost painful version of events in between two young men in 18th century France. This movie was about a murder mystery and not an entirely bad movie. A murder mystery involves three young men (martin(or Duchovony), a violinist(or Fess Parker(or Fess Parker(or Fess Parker(or Fess Parker(or Duchovony)) and a violinist(or one of the other two protagonists(martin(or Duchovony's fiancee) is the only one who really provides any hint of the true identity of the killer. The film is poor, overall giving this movie just a "fun" roll call of fate. I'd like to give this movie 3 out of five stars and a miss (acceptable) rating, just because it was so good.
neg This is an extremely long movie, it unfolds like a normal high school drama, you have to actually struggle with various emotions during the course of the film and get the final solution right away. If you can't sleep, you need a tissue or two. I had to give this movie 3 because I felt terrible for the actors who were playing it. It felt like I was in some kind of mental disarray at that point and that I needed psychiatric help after the third movie. I would have paid more attention to the dialogue if I was in North Africa, Africa, or the Middle East. All I found myself laughing about halfway through the movie, hating the idea that I would be kept in a mental institution because I did not have the strength to act like a maniacal maniacal killer. I would have
neg This is an extremely weak film and one that almost never gets a decent grasp on what a film is. What makes this film worth watching is how far it takes you, and what you get to get to do with it. Not to brag about this but I thought it would be interesting to give this documentary a miss. It certainly isn't perfect, but I really enjoyed it and thought it was worth watching. Enjoy!
neg Although its flaws were obvious flaws (e.g. it did not follow suit to most of its characters well), it is still an enjoyable movie that keeps you amused throughout the movie. The graphics are decent, the story is fun to play, and the direction of the movie is conducted by an artist (my dad is a huge collector of ancient and unique
neg This movie was fun to watch but at the end it was just so broken up and there was no fun in it. There were barely any extras. There was even a plot, I just couldn't believe anyone would make this into a movie. Thats just how bad this is. This movie was completely wasted time. There were no extras for this movie and it continues to stink. How can I possibly wrap this up? I can't believe I watched it and still can't seem to sleep, I just can't seem to get myself to do anything. I am at a loss for words. I can't seem to find them all in my head. I can't seem to muster the strength to say that I watched it all these years and it continues to stink like a ton of bricks. Nowadays I can find the words "f***ing lame" every time I go to the cinema. They all refer to this movie as the "spot the most hypocritical thing you can get" and "your fatness needs stacking". I thought the concept of banning all movie clips was hilarious. But when the film is finally
neg I saw this movie a couple of years ago and thought it was probably the worst horror movie I have ever seen. Alas, no such luck. Not only did it not convince me that the spirits demonstrate their love to each other, but it also lowered the spirits of the dead to their "acceptable" dead-end. I can't believe this happens. Not even George Kennedy was able to save Kennedy from sinking the Alamo. And of course, this movie was 100% boring. Casting was horrible. It would have been OK for the cast to have been here in the early 80s, and this was despite the fact that all the spirits had appeared before me. (I must have seen this in my teenage years!) So here we have it. Say those two lines over and over again, folks. We all know how much you love a monster movie and how much you will miss it when it is over. It is not a film to be frightened of.
neg This movie is so awful I almost died from it (yes it was that bad), but I will still go middle of the road with it and will watch again until I hear the conclusion. If you can't wait for it to end, skip it and get some good entertainment.
neg This movie was so bad it made it into a sore disappointment. When I watched it I got really bored halfway through and looked forward to seeing more films like this in the near future. I had seen lots of bad movies and yet none of them were worthy of my $20 or more. I can't seem to muster the strength to give the animated version of this movie a miss. What I mean to be honest is that I bought and watched the whole movie in my collection in my late 60's, hating it and hating it came after I fell in love with the guy. I loved every moment of it. I would definitely recommend this movie to anyone needing a break in the wall for a break or two, though I can't find the words to put it simply. I can't get over how bad it was, how the concept of love is supposed to be twisted and yet it still gives me hope and happiness to see a new, beautiful girl in my life! I can't help but wonder if Cinderella II is the real deal, since I've watched every single film I own in my collection, and have seen lots of bad movies over the years.
neg This movie is simply ridiculous. A bunch of lunatics try to do ANYTHING to get young men to commit murder, it is extremely difficult to actually execute or to actually execute them, especially in places like New York. I was very young and naive and naive at the time. But I had no idea that this movie would turn into a real-time murder mystery. The plot was predictable and the ending was predictable and the entire movie is a pile of cr*p. It was so predictable and ridiculous. I wish I could have watched it more or less years ago. I wish I had watched it like this. This movie is so much fun to watch.
neg This movie is so bad it must be considered non-existent. There are barely any extras. Not even the first acts are worth elementary school students watching. This movie was mildly entertaining and didnt really hurt in the least.I can barely breath in the background and it wasnt funny. I stand corrected. It was a rip off of "Deceived Media" and thats the worst part. I stand corrected and will be honest and repeat now. Its the same feeling. I can breath in the background all the way through. I was sitting in my uncomfortable seat in my uncomfortable seat at the New Beverly theater in Hollywood, watching this movie for about four hours straight. What an ending!?
neg This movie wasn't so much fun as you might have expected, but the cast was surprisingly entertaining, and I really enjoyed it. They had some funny scenes (one that I really, really didn't pay much attention to) and some really good acting (look out for that American remake of "Silverado" by the way, right?).The story was pretty lame, at best it felt like a compilation of recycled material, and it was probably best-efforted by a small but talented group of people. This movie takes the biscuit and tries to uphold the status quo through some really lame acting. And that's not even considering the fact that this movie is basically a compilation of recycled material (look at those terrible close up frames, it's like 90% of what they did with the original). The problem with it is the entire story seems to be a reflection of our younger days in Hollywood, and not of the younger film lover/specialist/friend/philosophical friend we had. This movie tries to uphold the old "one true love" formula, but it seems to me that people who view love in a different light (with some hint of realism) can still get a good laugh out of their mouths
neg This was supposed to be a fun horror film, not an exact remake. The cast couldn't hide their love for Ann-Margret and Frank Gielgud (Margaret Sullavan) Cary Grant, Cary Grant, Ava Gardner, and Katherine Heigl as well as their love of Ann-Margret (Margaret Sullavan). The acting was poor and did not carry the necessary gravitas. The only fun I had with the new cast was playing a nice girl named Faye (Margaret Sullavan), played by Rosalind Russell, who is just a lovely waitress from another waitress in the cafÃ©. Margaret Sullavan is not very good, she had just gotten a job and I had seen many funny movies in my time, but this little bugger never let down.I must say that this film has not disappointed. She really should have been cast as much nicer, more engaged, and less "regular". She is still entertaining as ever in Cary Grant's charming, sometimes ditsy-speaking character, and the witty detective William Powell especially. Very good job Cary Grant. Very sexy, but also funny. I love the twist here.
neg From Hong Kong to Washington Square, D.C. none of this should be a surprise. The film is very well-written, very well-written, and budgeted. It is also very well-developed, and is well-developed in relation to Hong Kong. I would recommend it to anyone needing an example of how to make a good-Chinese-American film. This film is well worth watching if it were made in the USA, as well as to anyone wanting to learn more about how to make a good-Chinese-American film. (Besides, watch it if you can!) (If you can't get Hong Kong, go find it elsewhere.) I was very excited to see this film in the early 90s, because it was first released in Hong Kong. The characters were well developed, the dialogue was conducted fairly well, and most important, the direction was good, and the direction was very interesting. Overall, this film is very well worth watching if it were made in the USA.
neg This movie is just plain fun. What really bothers me about this movie is the depiction of the various characters, and their various ways in life. None of them are particularly bad or bad, and most of them are simply not there in the movie. How do they all get along? Well, for one thing, you have the "liberated" female lead, played by Claire Forlani, who gets a job at the local hospital but basically takes care of the elderly and sick man (the geriatric one gets sick at a relatively early age because he's too young to take care of his elderly sister). She gets to work at a terrible, unemotional, and honestly void of love for her husband. It is hard to fully get a good grasp on how Anastasia changed after she met him halfway through, and she certainly didn't deserve this. So, to the rest of the cast...don't get me wrong, this movie is fun.
neg After seeing this film I had no idea what was going on. I thought, "Well, I guess it wasn't a big surprise to see this movie in the early 80s, because I was completely bored of the action in it. Not even George Kennedy was in there. Not even John Kennedy was there when I shot this scene. It was just a compilation of recycled material. Newspaper writer Roger Bohbot and amateur sleuth Bing Bing Bing try to find the plot in this extremely poor remake of Buster Keaton's "spot the location" by training him in the notorious New Mexico notorious Hunter Cubans. While he's at it, he accidentally hits a guy on the road, who they later discover is a former lover of Cubans and Mexico, and they both get stuck in a murder mystery suitable for his entertainment. As a matter of fact, we both ended up spending money on a local tv station, so that we both knew exactly where this was going. The plot is poor, and so it makes the movie seem like a good idea to just ignore it for now.
neg This film isn't an excuse for sexual exploitation of women. Sexuality in all its myriad ways, however, is still a terrible thing that needs to be punished. If there's ever a film that makes a lasting impression on your viewer it must surely be called "Happiness" or simply, "Thinking." That alone should be enough to convince you not only that such films are not worthy of veneration but that they are worthy of appreciation. If it isn't enough to convince you to open your minds to a deeper exploration of human carnality, then maybe it's time to stop beating the crap out of your sex-shop.
neg This was not about entertainment. It was about the disintegration of our civilization. A nihilistic, nihilistic nihilistic martial arts film with violence, bloodshed and gratuitous sex scenes. It was about the loss of all we have and how it has since been obliterated, whatever that may be. Not many movies this kind can combine with the rage and hysteria of a nihilistic martial arts film like this one. Of course, most of the rage and hysteria is the result of a single white guy's murder, the rage being used to make the heroine appealing to the viewer. It's strange how, after seeing this movie, I still can't seem to get over how this movie is supposed to be viewed. How could it have been viewed without the violence and graphic sex scenes in the original? Not to be confused with the fact that the villain, played by Giada Colagrande, has resorted to using a sharp piece of glass to slice up the victims and slice up their flesh. It works wonders how a nihilistic martial arts film can turn a nihilistic martial arts film into a real martial arts film. Once you've seen the original, this movie is simply breathtaking. Even though I think some of the blood and

neg This is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. It begins with me laughing in the background, then, I realize something. When I was seventeen years old I loved to watch westerns but that alone bored me. My sister actually liked westerns, and we would watch westerns on the TV.I've watched westerns on the TV for a while now, and it has become my favorite western film of all time. I watched westerns on the road, and even though I love westerns I still can't get over the scenery.So this is one of the worst movies I've ever seen. Don't get me wrong - this movie was awful awful, I know it sounds awful bad but I'll give you the meat and you'll get tired of it later. Don't get me wrong. I loved the eclecticism and the enchanting melancholy in the dialog. Of course I would have liked to see more westerns, especially westerns, but this is the exception. Westerns are terrible and often don't deliver on their own. They tend to get me some cold feet or something in my direction and that's not a good sign. Westerns are awful, and so what?
neg This is the worst movie I've ever seen. I'm sick and tired of writing about this film. I know I must have watched it a dozen times now, but this cinematic masterpiece never got a five-star rating. And to top it all, it was so weak. The dialogue was just plain unfunny. It was all too predictable. A nihilistic plot about "how to get what you want" is the exact same thing that I saw in the old woodcuts I always hated. The only
neg This is extremely disturbing and provocative, especially since the depiction of the various sex-ediers in this film is so much more than mere entertainment and a bunch of big budget children's television productions. Sexuality in general is just hype and hype promoted by big budget children's television productions, with little or no regard for the safety of the people in the film or even the content of the film. Sexuality is supposed to be a normal part of human sexuality, and every social contract requires the individual to act on it. The production is supposed to be about loving every person, not just one guy but two. Sexuality is supposed to be a "norm" sexual relationship between a man and a woman, provided that there is some sort of "boy". This is supposed to be about love for the man (or the woman) for awhile, until eventually, the two of them get together and go to some "boy's night". There are scenes where the two "good guys" actually do not even know each other (producers) but simply insult each other and make fun of their "boy". When the director puts his/her/boyfriend in the "room" of the movie theater, "put him in the pe

neg This was an enjoyable movie, and I was enticed to watch it because I was so young. It was fun to watch it in my teenage years and not too many movies that I'd like to miss this coming to America. It was also entertaining. It was good fun to have faith in Hollywood and not fall asleep at the theater watching this. My favorite character of course was the Toad, so he was always in my nightmares. It would have been nice to have had some kind of a supporting character for this movie. My guess is that somebody out there has a story that will make the entire audience appreciate it. If they can't get me to like this movie I'll give you a chance.
neg This film is just as bad as everyone says it is. Its speed, it looks bad. It is speed u cant understand. Its plot is terrible. Its bad. Its plot was totally predictable. i recommend this movie to anyone. 9 out of 10, god i hope whoever out there buys this movie and watch it again. god be with you all the way.
neg This movie is like nothing I've ever seen. It has one of those sweetie patsy moments you always had. It's funny, it's hard to get me to watch anymore, and it works on a very good level. It's a good movie, though. If you want an excuse to go to this film, I recommend it. Go get some sleep!
neg This movie is so lame it looks dumb, lame and insulting to all the kids in the theater. There is no reason why anyone would go to any expense at all in releasing this film. None of the characters are likable in it. The acting was poor. I think the producers wanted to make it appear dumb as well. The acting was bad and did not follow suit. (Or maybe the worst part of the movie is how they kept the gay newspaper critic ignorant about their gay newspaper critic, etc.. ) There were several brilliant scenes. (but that was the point. People can laugh with me.) It was like a compilation of Harry Potter movies. One of the best movies I've ever seen. (Besides the original)I wish I could have watched this movie over and over again but I can't really find it. It was so lame that I

neg This movie was so bad, I actually felt bad for it and it was hard to actually believe anything could be considered good. I thought maybe my special interest in this movie was in the arts and not in politics. There are too many of these films out there which are good and bad, and the message is not good, at least in this case. People getting 750 or more in a film festival can get 750 or more tickets. Not bad, no. 1. I don't think the movie did enough to hurt my feelings, 2. It was the worst I've ever felt in my life. I had flashbacks over the course

I really enjoyed this movie, and I wish that I was in North Africa. If you can't get enough of Africa, this is a must see.
neg I would like to argue that there isn't enough drama to sustain a laugh or two during the entire movie. It's hard to actually laugh a full two hours into a movie because you actually feel ripped off. It's hard to actually get me to like my favorite character, so many jokes that seem pointless or plain wrong can be quickly cut off by the end of the movie. It's hard to actually laugh a full two hours into a movie.
neg This is a great film. If you can't get enough of this film, keep an eye out for Unforgiven. It has great acting and a great cast. Everyone should give this film a chance. This film is perfect for those people who love surprises or plot twists and want to be totally hidden away from all the fun and mystery and intrigue of this world. And those who love surprises also have to forgive themselves some of the mistakes in this film. This is a great film, and I will watch it again when it comes out on DVD. (And if you love surprises, keep an eye out for Unforgiven.)Okay, this is the movie. It has all the charm of a romantic love story, the plot is perfect, and the ending is even better. It has the feel of a true love story. I have to admit that I was disappointed with this film, and I am certainly disappointed. (If you liked it, watch it here. I+II) And to top it all, it has BEAUTIFUL B. It is hard to put the words "favourite" into words, but this film is definitely my favorite, and I am certain that it will be in
neg It occurs to me that this movie takes place in a real estate project in which there is no such thing as "san pedro" (which means "rental" in Spanish). When I watched this movie I got very excited because I absolutely loved the simplicity and the eclecticism in the story. The story was so frank and touching and touching and I wish I could have made this movie more digestible, because I felt it was the best way to show that to all viewers of "san pedro" (the real estate project) this movie was just hype. It was uplifting and real. I love the simplicity and I can't speak Spanish, it was uplifting to see beautiful women in real estate, as well as beautiful people in the real estate world. They had to work, they were all in it and it was worth it. The projectors were so young and so talented. They had no idea that they were getting a makeover when they came up with the projectors, and so this movie captured my imagination like never before. I was young and naive at first. But I found it very heart-warming and sheer breathtaking how they took all this into their own universe. Not so much this movie
neg This film is so dense that you actually feel it is almost painful, yet so funny that even the most infantile viewer will feel it every moment. You get to love, not only from a love story but also from a love story. It has an allure of the enchanting coulisses and the enchanting coulisses, and it has a great deal of singing in it. It is a romantic love story. And I love the eclecticism. It is very cleverly put together. I think that it makes love a wonderful thing. And that it was written with a great deal of love. I am not a great fan of mixing love with tragedy. There are too many good things in life. tragedy often is the first thing to happen to you, it occurs to you to you after all these are over and it continues until the very end.

neg This film is extremely bad and at times its weak. Its main disadvantage is its weak point. Director Kenneth Branagh deliberately keeps us all in the dark and constant terror of a terror murder mystery. This movie isn't like Grimms, Xena: Warrior Princess, Xena: Warrior Princess, and Xena: Warrior Princess. I would recommend it to everyone, including myself. Don't get me wrong though. The movie was OK with me and did a mediocre job at best. This is a good movie. I wish Alicia Silverstone was here, but she is so... evil. She was really bad, in a bad way. Not only did it get me through this travesty of a plot and yet another great movie in it. This is also a good lesson in how not to watch a horror movie (even though I do think that's the reason for its absence) and I highly recommend it to all movie buffs.
neg Although this film was made over two years ago it is still fresh and entertaining every time I watch it. My son is still very excited to see this movie in the near future, even though I can't seem to muster the strength to actually pay his full enough attention to tell him about what's going on. As far as I can tell, this film takes a very long time to get to know the cast and directors. What I can tell you is that Adam Sandler is an extremely talented, talented and talented director. He directed this film, so it goes without saying that it is a Takashi Miike film, a genuine comedy. It is indeed the greatest movie I have ever seen. Its great acting and superb acting have made it one of the best filmgoing experiences I have ever had. I love this film, its characters are complex, funny and intelligent, its story is extremely touching and touching and real. Its a film that I will treasure for years to come.
neg This is a very good thriller/horror movie. The Plot is extremely well paced and the acting is conducted excellently. The story revolves around a young reporter (Boyle) who finds out that an unknown person has been bothering her all these years and they all talk about how they all got "here." She obviously doesn't understand the culture and they all talk about how this whole thing came to be and what it was like to work in this harsh, unattractive, ungulates world. I am surprised at how little the *spoiler* of the movie is actually going down, as I've always been very surprised by *spoiler*s. The *spoiler*s were pretty hilarious. This movie had none. It was funny, it was funny, it was uplifting and I just felt bad for my country. (Or at least I did in fact think that it was meant to be. The "heroine" in this movie was not a very good person, she was just a parasite who wants nothing but to get what she wants.

I enjoyed it a lot and I will definitely watch it again if they come to my shop. It is sooo good that you actually feel good about yourself after seeing it.I really like how the stranger handling the stranger's story seems a bit contrived. I don't like confrontation so much in this film. It is just so...amazing. I can't seem to muster the strength to say that I give it 4 out of five stars because...maybe it was my imagination or some artistic process. It would have been OK if this movie had been done a different way. The stranger, as always, was extremely nice and handled it well. I admire his professionalism and professionalism. I give this film 4 out of five stars.
neg This was an extremely high school play in which everyone forgot their lines when it came time to actually play. It was funny, massive, massive, and very funny. Even the most infantile fans of the "wronged" would be sourly disappointed. The only fun I had with the prank phone calls was the prank phone calls to the local hospital. It would have been nice to have been able to get a laugh out of the students if we had kept this up to a relatively high school level. The prank phone calls, however funny, were just plain fun. And I've watched a lot of it, mostly in my teenage years. How many people knew better? Well, the prank phone calls to the local hospital were hilarious and funny. They were just plain fun to deal with. They were funny and not all that bad, and they were very funny. And the prank phone calls to the local sheriff's station were extremely funny. The sheriff was laughing a lot, and we all know how bad it was. I wish the prank phone calls had ended this way, because I have nothing against the prank phone calls to the local hospital. (Besides the bad guy who kicked the crap out of them, and the prank phone
neg This is such a great movie. I absolutely loved it. I love the concept of a civilization that was wiped out during World War II and it continues to this day. Even John Gielgud's contribution was worth elementary school books for me. It's strange to think that he thought "all of history" would be preserved within this movie, not even the sinking of the Alamo and the Texas fight is worthy of serious consideration. I absolutely loved it when it was first put on. It became my favorite short film of all time. I wish I could have written a better movie, but I can't seem to muster the strength to say that this one was the best and worst movie I've ever seen. It's like Cinderella tale, in that it's very dark, yet charming. But hey, hey, hey, everybody!
neg This is not a great movie but it is an enjoyable film. It is very dark, yet at the same time very good acting. It unfolds like a very good western film. There is very little nudity in the dialog, and the narration is very good. Of course there are several scenes that are very dark. Of course, most of them are the climaxes. Of course, there are a couple of nice touches to the story. One of the main characters (Hiroshima) is a very annoying bugger (Susan) and one of the main characters (Hiroshima) is a very annoying bugger. Hats off to everyone who liked this movie. It has a nice dark humor about it and quality that you can find somewhere in the Harry Potter universe. I've read some good reviews of this movie and I will give it a miss. I really enjoyed it. It is clever and touching, and has a very nice ending. (Acceptance of the love story/dream/dream sequence is wonderful!)
neg This movie is not like "Hooper" or "Silverado" but rather, it is about a small village in Scotland that finds itself placed in a mental institution through an unknown third party. Shortly after their release from it, they are
neg I can't get enough of this movie to watch in my teenage years. I've watched over 80 films, which means that I can afford to miss much of it in the early going. However, this movie is definitely worth a watch if you can afford it. The characters are likable and the setting is perfect. Overall, this movie was good to watch. It's a great trip, fun to watch and keep up with friends and family.
neg I generally think the Theory of Speed Needel is just hype. Of course, all of its hype is justified and there is just nothing to be taken credit for. Everyone loves Speed Needel and its 2 short films. It is great cinema. There are no hidden agendas in the making of this movie. This film was supposed to be about speed and justice in Africa. It was uplifting. It was uplifting to see Africa, but in fact this film was about justice and justice in this case was about justice and justice in the end. It also had a good supporting cast. The production values were high and the direction was still good. The acting was great and the direction was good. The story was also very good. I enjoyed it and I would recommend it for anyone needing an example of how fast paced or cinematic it can be. My only complaint is that Speed Needel is so much better, and that it's so much better that it came into focus on this topic. It's not just that there isn't enough good direction in this film, there are some very good directions in the making, etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc. etc.
neg From 1968, when Don Johnson first recorded his first feature film, and then in the early 60s, he made numerous films that relied on his expertise as an actor/producer. For example, in King Creole he would portray a blues musician playing an American in an old rural setting, and in King Creole he would portray a blues musician playing the American soldiers in his regal regal blues tunic. He would play the captain, the blues lover, and get 750 blues stars. This was the blues song he loved to do. The blues song was so original, it became part of the song and became part of his routine. He made numerous television shows around the world and wrote music for them. This documentary will show you how to make your own records, get some great blues tunes and a blues version of "The Hot Spot" or "Renaissance" and blues version of "Single White Female" on the radio. If you can't get them to do it, skip it and get a copy of the movie.
neg This movie was a good comedy. I loved the concept of it and I would recommend it to anyone needing a dose of realism in order to open themselves to the true horrors of the modern day. The cast is decent and Marlene Dietrich is entertaining as Kitty (Melford), the femme fatale (Margaret Sullavan) and the screwball (Jim Nabors). The acting is good, and Jo Swerling is entertaining and charming as Kitty. Overall, I was very pleased with this movie. Definitely recommend this movie for those people needing an example of how to act in a real estate investment or real estate transaction.
neg This is one of the best moviesgoing experiences ever. It unfolds like a true story with a clarity and a clarity of purpose and a clarity that sets it apart from all the other great literary detective novels. I think it is one of the best literary detective novels I've ever read. I like detective novels that aren't dumb, but still give you a good dose of class and you feel at home watching this movie. There is more to it than that. There are good detective novels, bad detective novels, romance, romance, plot twists, plot twists, etc. (Besides the love story, there are the gothic romance and the mysterious woman herself. I don't know much about the other fictional characters that surround her and what kind of monster she is.) So...good job! Plot! I love the mystery and mystery surrounding this movie. I have read some great books on the subject but this is one of those that will keep me reading and following great books for sure. 9 out of 10 (One of the worst books I have ever heard of). If you were a detective, you know you wouldn't want to be here but I assure you, this movie is for you.
neg This film is extremely weak and uninspired. It has none of the above, the most obvious reason being that the main character(s) are so young and impressionable. I'd like to argue that Sofia Coppola deserved better, but what really bothers me about this film is the way in which the focus is placed on her (male lead) rather than her character. I can't help but wonder if some sub plots are similar to those in the Harry Potter movies. I've read a lot of bad books in the Harry Potter canon, and some of them are actually good books. However, Sofia Coppola seems to find a niche for herself in this kind of thing. She seems to have learned a lot about film making in the making of "Silverado" (or rather, a Dads film), and she still seems to struggle to find a partner. She obviously knows better things about making movies than this guy does, and she certainly has talent. But despite the fact that Sofia Coppola seems intent on destroying all of them, it shows how far she can take this movie and what a terrible amateur sleuth she is. Her screwball job really hurt her. She's not doing anything
neg This is a terrible movie, it should be ashamed of itself. If I were in any role where I saw this movie it would be titled "Dear Friends". It would be titled "Dear Friends", and "Dear Friends: A Conversation With a Little girl" (which I believe is what it was) "Dear Friends" would be the title. I am extremely sickened by it. I was only mildly surprised by this movie's rating, but then I couldn't buy it. I was completely bored throughout the entire film, and it continues to stink. What a waste of time!
neg This movie is awful, bad and bad. Let's just say that I enjoyed it. It has a lot going on in it that I wanted to watch over and over, but not this time. Not as much as I expected. It is good, every moving part is perfect. The acting is perfect, the direction in which the story is being told is perfect, and the characters are allusions to all the characters are well-developed. I am still not 100% certain that this movie is real, but I will say that if it is, this movie would stand on its own. The dialogue is poor. The script (producers of this movie should give this movie a chance) is awful, and it is almost painful, even considering all the characters' expressions and how they try to hide their sexuality. The acting was poor, and it was robotic. I can't believe that anyone would have paid much attention to this movie when it was first released, as I watched it on VHS in the early 90's. If you can't appreciate it, skip it and get a copy of "Silverado" or whatever you like.
neg This film features Wei Pei of course, Chang Cheh and a bunch of his cohorts go to Africa, meet a local woman (Lydia) in law who appears to be in law as a relatively recent arrival. She is very nice to all of them and seems to give them a lot of support. Overall, it is a rather good martial arts film. Not bad, bad for that, I think - but that's not a good sign if it came from outside of Africa, as the western eye catching more of the action in this film. I think that Wei Pei deserved better, but I don't see why it was snobbish at the time. The action is very good, and I congratulate him for that. I think it was a great film. The action was good, and even if it has been this long ago it still gives Wei Pei and his group an added dimension to the film. It is funny to watch people getting hit in the head over a drink in the span of 45 seconds, even though it is very well-written and it is clever. Of course, the supporting characters are the story-turns in the film, as is the snowball effect of the snowball effect. I
neg My husband is not a huge Robin Williams fan and we've been very quiet and kind throughout the whole time I've been away from home. I know his influences are pretty much in his movies but this one really grabs us by the proverbial balls and grabs us like we're being sucked into a big ocean or something. It is extremely hard to get my $20, I know that some people will get bored halfway through and they'll get bored quickly.I will give this movie 4 out of five stars because it is such a sore disappointment for the entire family. I really can't get over all the guilt of it all at the end of the day.
neg After seeing this movie, I complained to my local cinema about it every time the cinema came on. When the cinema came on it was like "What the hell!" People would be cheering you on, they loved you and would tell you about how the movie came on. It was just "fun" for them to see. I don't know if anyone who serves time away from work can tell you how much fun it is, how much fun it is to be away from home with my kids, or what it is like to constantly do all these things while
neg I sat down to watch "Friday the 13th" at the lake and found myself laughing a few times during the whole movie. Actually I loved this movie, and I congratulate myself for that. Of course, it is still fresh and funny, and I congratulate myself for not wasting money on a ticket. Not one bit. I wish I could have bought it, but I did not expect it to be that bad. Was it bad? Was it good? Not at all. Not that bad, I just think that it adds a little something to the fun, especially since the kids always liked Scooby Doo Live Action! This movie is great. My special favorites are Scooby Doo Live Action, Scooby Doo Live Action, Scooby Doo Live Action, Scooby Doo II, Scooby Doo Live Action, Scooby Doo Live Action, Scooby Doo Live Action, Scooby Doo Live Action, Scooby Doo Live Action with my dad and the cast of Scooby Doo Live Action Unlimited, Scooby Doo Live Action Unlimited, Scooby Doo Live Action Unlimited, Scooby Doo Live Action Unlimited with my sister, and soon the cast would become even funnier
neg This is the first episode of Survivor Series 2001. The first half hour of the episode probably didn't move along as much as you expected. The villain, however, was very good and charming throughout the entire episode. There was even humor in some of the introductory jokes and the way he portrayed it. The other half hour was probably the best part of the episode and I wish I was here. The villain was a real bad guy who wanted to eat soup with his friends. The battle Royal went on for 45 minutes, and everyone knew it was over. Everyone knew it was a real plot. I was in disbelief at first but then realized how much more important it would be had it not been for the third time round. Everyone knew that there was going to be bloodshed in this Survivor Series. Everyone knew that there would be more bloodshed in this Survivor Series than two hours ago and now it would have been over. This is the most hypocritical Survivor Series ever. If you want any proof of your love for the Alamo during the Texas fight for independence, go get it now. This is the most hypocritical Survivor Series ever, and I repeat this: If you want to get 750% you should definitely go to this great place. Its

neg This is not a movie about the Depression yet. It's a documentary about a woman's struggles with her job and life after having a sexual partner for 20 years. It portrays the true horrors of modern day relationships and the ways in which our modern day relationships are no more than "put in place" for men. There is even an unhealthy large amount of gratuitous violence used against women. In the end it all gets back to the ultimate form of "cringeworthy" entertainment, by the very people that want to make movies about love and sex. Men's rights movement buffs will tell you that loving and having sex with a man is wonderful and that loving and having sex with a man is wonderful and that you should just go "home". All men should do the "wrong" thing and get some form of help in this life. It's hard to conceive of anyone wanting to become a good husband or even a true 'liberated', "liberated' or 'liberated' woman. I would fill my thoughts with books on love, relationships, and relationships in general. I can't find them all here.
neg In terms of visual beauty and class, I really can't get enough of that here. It's hard to actually put one's rating down to bad, because I think it was heavily influenced by auteuil and nebulona (respectively). When I watched the original I really felt bad about it. But this was the worst horror movie I've ever seen. There were too many close up frames and the ending nearly made it appear as if the spirits of some sort were setting the stage. I don't know what happened to them but I can clearly tell you that the spirits were there and the lighting was on...very bad. I sat down to watch this movie because I absolutely had no idea what horror movies were about. And because I bought it, I must have seen it hundreds of times. Not one movie reviewer gave me a miss, so it is with them. Worth recommending.
neg This movie was mildly entertaining and not bad at all. I enjoyed it and looked forward to seeing more like this film. My expectations were confirmed by the reviewer.I was sitting down in my uncomfortable seat, watching this movie on my tablet, watching until the end of the day when it finally came to me. I had no idea what happened, or what the hell I was doing. Was it some kind of mental disarray, or was it something deeper than that? Whatever it was, it left me feeling very good about myself and even better that I still had all the time left to do.
neg This was the worst movie I've ever seen. It was like elementary school books I've ever seen. The plot was so broken that I couldn't even wrap my head around it. And that wasn't even the worst part. It was just plain awful. The acting was horrible. The plot was so broken that it nearly made you forget what you were doing and just focus on one another. The characters were so stupid and white...and in some places they made it appear that they were just plain stupid. I was dragged through the school in my uncomfortable seat and even though I was able to speak Spanish, I had to struggle for an interminable amount of time. I couldn't get over the fact that I was so young and yet still having trouble with Spanish, and that was despite the fact that I was able to understand the character so well. And then I got stuck in the French for the third time in my life, and this bored me out of boredom for the next two hours. I really loved it and wish god god could save my life from this terrible movie! This was such a wild concept. It was so much fun to have, and I really loved it.
neg I saw the film about three years ago and it still keeps me on the edge of my seat in disbelief at the thought that anyone watching the film intending to watch a horror film (that I do not understand) is ignorant of the subtleties and similarities in the various spirits haunting haunting haunting us all over the world. This is not a film about hauntings, but a genuine love story about a young girl in a mental institution. She is haunted in the room that most often "knocks" on your door, because you were too young to be there. She is always picking on people she knows and there are always creepy creatures around her. Sometimes they don't even know who is in there and what is going on. This film is not about hauntings or the ghosts haunting them, but it is about loving, especially the person herself. Marilyn Manson sings about her struggles in the making of this film. And the title of the film even says it all! Marilyn Manson is so evil. She makes all the evil in her song!

neg This is the third movie in the "holiday horror" genre. As usual, you will get to enjoy this movie in either the original language or in some other language. It is extremely disturbing territory. There are some good supporting work from Marjorie Rambeau (who wrote a novel in the style of "Hamlet" in which we spend our winters with her) and a lovely understated send-up by Marjorie Rambeau (who wrote a novel), but these two shorts really put the movie into perspective. I stand corrected. The plot is very well-developed and it unfolds into the conclusion very well. The story revolves around a young Brad Pitt as an added sexual interest in the actress' character. Knowing Pitt, as we all do, that his screwball girlfriend, played with the most naive of naivety and ambition of his life, and especially his near-monologue about the nature of love, it is well worth watching if it continues to move along along as it should.
neg This movie is simply disgusting. It has nothing to do with the original movies but serves to show that somebody out there is still ignorant and they need to learn how to be a good, hard-working, hard-to-take-your-holiday-class-holiday-passionist/open minded person. It also showcases the worst movies I've ever seen, the worst movies I've ever seen and to this day still can't seem to muster the strength to say one thing about it. I can breath, skip over the dialog completely, and still get the message out to all the viewers.It shows the very poor handling of the subject matter and the ridiculousness of the "holiday plot". The focus and quality of the movie is simply disgusting. I can breath in the content, I can't even think of anything positive elements - avoid being too serious and avoid being completely bored. Don't get me started on the preview too early.
neg In the early 60's, America's Gothenburg Film Festival was the "American Beauty" or "The Hot Spot" for Hollywood Squares. There was good supporting work from Laurence Olivier, Christopher Walken, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, and many others. The best supporting work came from Robert de Niro (who wrote this movie), who wrote lyrics to the end of this movie, "Don't Look Now" (and I love to watch it), and from Robert de Niro's contribution to this magnificent 1972 film (which is the only one to ever reach the top of PO Box 237), "Silverado" (1999). Robert de Niro also wrote and directed this movie. It is one of only two westerns in the entire history, and one of only two with Laurence Olivier (who wrote lyrics to this great classic). De Niro is best remembered for his "Silverado" screenplay and especially for his collaborations with Giada Colagrande in the marvelous 1972 film "Dear Friends" (starring David Ogden Stiers, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Christopher Walken, and many others); but he also wrote lyrics for the film's villain, and especially for the song, "

neg This movie is lame, lame, lame. A lame plot, lame acting, lame direction, lame acting. It is a remake of the old "holiday horror" movies (not horror films) and is basically standard fare for a motion picture in a "holiday horror" film (not like modern day horror movies, where all the scares are justified and there are some suspense and there is humor), not even George Kennedy's famous "Stroker Ace" sound effect or "Stroker Ace" sound effect. The only fun I had with this movie was to watch this old classic again, only this time it was more fun. It's a great movie. Its pretty lame at times, especially during the "holiday horror" movies. I wish the producers would give more time to explore the themes of the movie. All the better for that reason in this movie.

neg This is one of those cases where I actually feel bad for the creator, Harp, Harp and Pressburger who have made tons of bad movies over the years and still can't get a decent job at a newspaper. This is Harp's best feature film of all time. It doesn't hurt that huge a smile is all it takes to make me laugh, it just keeps me chuckling every moment. The producers wanted something along the line of "Not that bad, Harp". I mean, they made a movie about how we all feel, Harp and Pressburger. They also wanted to make sure we all knew each other. And that way Harp was able to give us his or her honest opinion. I don't know if the producers intended for this to be an insult to the entire cast, but it was clever, and I mean funny. Overall, a fine film, Harp's witty direction and all of the above is just icing on the proverbial "cake" during this interminable 93 minutes.
neg In terms of quality and content, the Bocabonita Katona no Mi is simply outstanding. I absolutely loved coming into her world in 2001: Warrior Princess and the 2 sisters knowing that they would never have to miss this great cultural event. Her story is so engaging, I think it was inspired by the 80s, and is very well-written. I absolutely loved her voice actress as well as her acting. It was so funny. I was able to get a laugh out of her and she was completely believable and charming throughout her interaction with the various male characters, and especially during the party scenes. This was a great fun time to have, and I am
neg It occurs to me that the depiction of the main character as femme fatale was too weak, too amateur, and too high-cannon. Not a great mystery. The depiction of the femme fatale was too weak, too amateur. Too bad that there was no one around to take the time to actually think about what character was really playing in the movie.
neg I am very pleased to say that this movie was totally boring. It had some pretty lame acting, but that was just because I was young. I was so bored and bored throughout the entire movie. I sat down at my parents' house watching dirty movies on the TV, hating every moment they had to do it. My sister is so decrepit and decrepit she has to actually struggle to eat all day. I was really depressed throughout the movie.I really had no idea what to do with myself after this movie was done. I can't seem to get over all the sudden "Did I miss something important" and "Did it hurt you?" feeling. I sat in my parents' car in the middle of the road, hating myself and hating the entire cast. Not that I blame them, I just felt they didn't understand what I was doing or why. I don't know
neg This is an extremely long film, but extremely fun to watch and has some great characters. I love how Anisio is so frank and honest and upfront about his character and the relationships he has with each of his friends. This also has me laughing a lot, especially Anisio because I really felt he was sincere and honest about everything.I would like to see a remastered version, though the story may be somewhat different.I like the dialogue a lot in the new version too, and will definitely be reworking the dialogue in the new version.I generally like the different ways Anisio approaches things, the nature of the relationship, and the way he operates in this regard.I also liked the way Anisio kept everything a secret and basically kept everything out of focus throughout the whole film. I loved the concept of being honest about everything, and even though the plot was somewhat whiny at times it was still enjoyable to watch.The story is also very interesting and very interesting. Although, this movie is extremely long, and it was made over 3 years ago, I can still find my copy here in the shops.

neg This is extremely disappointing. As far as I can tell, there is no way this movie is going to move along this territory. It is a Japan-set haunted house story with a story that revolves around a young man named Ismael, a violinist, and his wife, whom they unwittingly have in the company of a couple of Japanese nurses. After traveling along on separate tracks for awhile, I finally came across it. At the risk of being completely spoiler, I gave the plot a miss. Although there was some suspense, it was still good fun to watch it. I really enjoyed it and I would recommend it for anyone needing an excuse to stay up late, especially those who already know the cast and can afford to rent a nice house in the area. It is very good fun to have a family in a small village and have fun in it. It is a Japan-set haunted house story with lots of mystery surrounding the young Ismael's tragic death. This film is good entertainment and I really can't recommend it as much as the movie is bad.
neg This isn't like the Star Wars movies, and the villain is clearly not that bad, it just looks dumb and uninspired. The villain is so stupid (and it doesn't hurt that I have to ask) that even the most intelligent character in this movie would barely understand anything about who was behind all these terrible crimes. If you can't get a good grasp of the plot, this movie is for you. Avoid it and focus on other things. Avoid the violence. Avoid the bloodshed. Avoid being a hero.
neg This film seems to me to deal with the psychological process called individuation. There is no such thing as individuation in psychology.

It's hard to think of anything that I can say that can't be verified by the 2 of us (Max) in the desert, but it adds a lot to it. I loved coming to the Western Plains of Wyoming during the Texas mountains, and I wish we could have explored it in the future. It's a wild and wonderful place, and I would have been proud to own it. I love the desert. And the desert, the desert, and the desert, the desert... It's what makes it so special. I had seen and survived the desert for the most part. But now...this movie is so much better. I wish we could have explored deeper and maybe even explored this territory. We all know it isn't easy, and maybe it is. But...this movie is so much better! I love the desert.

We love Marlene and we wish Alicia Silverstone would come in and save us all. The acting and direction is excellent and Marlene is just beautiful. She is so much of a big plus that she can really hide in plainclothes. The acting is also very good and Marlene is just as hot and irresistible as every character in this movie. She is so much nicer, and we like her in the movie even though we were young. Overall, this is a
neg It continues the story of how we all fall in love, even though we spend far too much time together. We all know we fall in love with each other when we share the same bed. Sometimes it's just a dream or two, and then there are the events that shape our relationships and shape our futures. Sometimes it's a happy ending, and we all at one point are very happy. Sometimes we wish we could have ended up with more of this beautiful love story, or maybe just to simply "part" (and not have it end) with our souls and minds together. But now we find out what love really is all about and what makes it all worth it.And then we get to see the happy side of things in the relationship, the person that is best friend and that we always have. So, my question is...would you like to see this film? If you like Eclectic Beautiful Love Beautiful Love (or Beautiful Love Beautiful Love) please
neg This movie is outstanding! The acting is perfect, it unfolds like a romantic comedy, and the resolution is perfect. It is very well paced, with a great cast and an engaging plot. It has a great atmosphere about it. It is also very well acted. I am very excited to see the new movie coming out. If you are a fan of the original, keep an eye out for "Yankee Doodle Dandy" and "Dandy Doodle Dandy" and "Shanghai Girl" on DVD.
neg This isn't like much of a Japan film, nor is it a watered-down remake of Akira that tries too hard to uphold its charm. It's hard to actually watch a commercial for a motion picture if you can't get enough of the humor or atmosphere from the original Japanese. The problem is that it was made for TV (by American households with Japanese household names) and is still being improved upon. Unfortunately, its still a sore disappointment since it was released. As for me, it's not funny in the original, but it still funny enough to keep my interest throughout the entire film. I love this movie. My Japanese love of fast paced martial arts movies is still fresh and irresistible. This is just the best western I've ever seen.
neg This is a classic of "non sequitur comedy" and serves as a satire of the modern day. It also showcases the comedic styling of many of the characters and outfits from different periods of your life. (There were a few jokes that were poorly carried out in this film. For example, the geriatric ensemble of Dudley, Kitty, the doting sister, and Dudley's unceremonious dismissal by the 'good guy' (Susan) almost made my blood drop in my bookshelf. (Acceptance of their dismissal by Dudley would have been an amazing scene) Dudley has a vision problem that I often feel as though he is unable to work out, so this film takes a break from his routine to address this very real problem. To put it another way, you see how far this film strays away from the normalcy in most societies. It's pretty hilarious to watch Dudley do it, especially since he obviously knows that frequent cursing, bigoted male characters, and the constant threat of violence are all part of a plot to hurt Dudley. Even John Gielgud, Dudley's fiance, who was born into poverty, now looks puffy after taking Dudley's place at the laboratory where they were
pos Where were we when this movie came out? This is definitely one of those movies that fills your mind with a good dose of good old English. I have always found it interesting how the subtitles refer to you as a trespasser, a bigoted bigoted pervert, and bully. I'm seldom surprised by films that don't follow suit, and I can find no reason why anyone would begin a project with subtitles like this, because they tend not to follow suit. 
pos I've watched this movie about four times in my life, and it has made me appreciate living in North Africa. I've seen movies like "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (2002) and "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (2005), and I can still see the funny side of things in the movie. And this movie has never been out of my mind (for the most part). It is very well-written and has a good pace of its own. But its still an enjoyable movie to watch if you like inciteful movies like "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (2002) or "Yankee Doodle Dandy" (2005), and if you want to jump off a bridge, this movie would definitely recommend it! Don't get me wrong - this movie was good. The action is good and the scenery is good. I like the rats, and the rats make it realistic. It also has some nice touches (particularly in the tree-dotted village) and is definitely one of the best motion pictures I have ever seen. I highly recommend it for those who love to watch this movie and who want to experience it from a different viewpoint. Highly recommended for those who love the desert, or want to experience things
pos Back in 2004, I watched a documentary about Africa and Africa in Africa. The documentary "Don't Look Now" came out and it was uplifting to see the stories of Africa in Africa, Africa, Africa, Africa...and Africa. The focus was Africa.I saw Africa in my early 20s on a "holiday" in Africa, but Africa was still fresh in my mind. I don't think Africa really hve made a lot of Africa during the 90`s. The movie did a good job at portraying the different ways in which people can relate to one another in Africa. I would recommend it to those who are struggling with poverty and are unable to work. You should definitely go see it. It is very good. (and you should too) recommend it to everyone. It is very good to see how other people can relate to one another in Africa, or to the land scene. This film was uplifting to me. I really felt a deep caring for the people in need of a home, especially those living in poverty. (And it was uplifting to see that people are able to work, rent, or even own a home and can afford to do so. I would go middle eastern Africa -

pos This is one of those cases where we seem to find our heroes either ignorant of our heroes or too frightened to act them, or both. We tend to look up to no other hero in Hollywood, because it is considered fashion that we get to see so many bad movies about women. We've seen too many bad movies about how bad Hollywood was treating Hollywood and yet still get a good laugh from the good guys. We liked "Silverado" and "Hooper" among the better films. "Silverado" is a good film about Hollywood not doing a great job of portraying the bad movies (not that bad). It is not an entirely bad movie, but it has moments that seem like they all at the time were pulled off as a mere "fun" movie. I liked how "Silverado" came out on top of "Hooper" for being a good movie about bad movies (not bad for that, I just think that bad movies are bad). I liked it so much that I
pos So now we have an entirely new movie coming out! How can I help you out with this movie? Let me assure you that it is a genuine American tale that will appeal to everyone, everywhere, whether they're young, or white or white men, who is attracted to beautiful women. It is extremely hard to get a good grasp on what makes this movie unique, I must tell you that this movie is not 100% English. It is not a good film at all, I just find myself laughing a lot when it unfolds. It unfolds in a way that makes it appear real to you, and makes you wonder what the hell is going on inside this magnificent old house that I was just visiting. There are some great literary fests for which I can take a break from here to address the plot...you can find them here, and you can find it on DVD if you're into it. I won't bother rehashing the plot here, but I will just say that if you like Eclectic Beautiful Love Beautiful Love Beautiful Love it's going to be an enjoyable experience to watch! Enjoy!
pos I'm pretty sure that if you watched this movie I missed something. This is my favorite movie, and it shows that despite being a relatively small town I can still make a lasting impression on the kids. They don't mind me if I go, but that's not a good sign if they're honest about it. Adults can handle it. Adults can handle the boredom. And the kids know the insides of things and how to make them appealing to them and still get a good laugh out of their mouths when they do it. And so, the movie was fun to watch for a number of reasons. One of the reasons being that I loved watching westerns was that I couldn't wait for "holiday" to happen. To those of you who already know this movie was good, keep in mind that I've watched it 2, 3, and a half hours ago. I bought it and I will watch it again on DVD. Don't get me started on the preview too early.

pos It was the greatest martial arts film ever made. It mat noted up like a million dollar budget, but the fight scenes were still great. It matinee was the best ever, and not one guy in the whole village knew who was making it. This was the best western martial arts film ever made. It matinee was the best fighting movie I have ever had the misfortune to watch.It matinee had a great story about how to become an inventor of incredible martial arts, and that was even more so in that it was highly recommended by my local watch list. It was an enjoyable movie to watch even though it was my favorite martial arts movie in the entire village. It matinee was unique in that it was so close to the REAL "martin" that I needed to be in a "regular" fight for them. That way I can still get my blood going after a couple of hours. This is a great martial arts film and the first time I ever saw one! Definitely recommend it!
pos This is a great movie, featuring some great characters and some very interesting plot twists. The villain is very well portrayed in this movie, and you would expect a well cast made movie. The plot and motivations are very well portrayed, and the villain is very well played, as he has very interesting character and motivations. I really enjoyed this movie, and I greatly enjoyed it. Highly recommended. The story is very well paced, and the villain is extremely well-developed throughout the movie, and he is very well-developed throughout. There is a very good reason why this movie was so good, and why its so good. I absolutely loved every moment of it, and I wish I was more of a hero in it. The villain was very well-developed, and you could tell the plot well, as was the entire cast. Overall I highly recommend this movie, especially for those people who enjoy a good dose of espionage thriller thriller.
pos This is a genuine gem from Hong Kong, made famous by the late Chang Cheh, who made a lasting impression on us all over the world. This gem is one of only a few remaining gem cinematically interesting films on the island. Not even Chang's performance here is worthy of appreciation. A fine piece of work from Hong Kong's finest cinematography and the sets is a real standout. The story is a good mystery, Chang has an innocence about Chang (the man) that makes him appealing to all the viewers. This is Chang's story. A boy named Chang is ambitious, and ambitious enough to build a small business around Chang's home. Little does he suspect that he is playing a big, bad boy/open minded character, or that Chang is simply operating a mental institution. Whatever the case, Chang's charm and professionalism and work ethic make him a valuable partner. Little does he suspect that Chang is a good man, a man that always skitters out of a mental picture, makes mistakes all the time, and often gets stuck in a "comedy" situation that makes him appealing to the very people he knows. All portray a different picture than the one we had when we were young.
pos Timberlake was the most entertaining and most entertaining Survivor Series history ever. It was about the invasion of Mexico, and not about the bloodshed, bloodshed or the invasion of an American hero. It was about the guilt of some of the more than a few, mostly white people who were wiped out during the invasion. It was a clever plot to base the storyline on, and not just because some of the early-comedy groupthinkers wanted to prove that Mexico is not the best place for a civilization to build. But then, it was also about the invasion and its aftermath, which eventually ended up with a very good comedy revolving on two fronts. The first is about the invasion. The invasion was a win for America, but it was also a win for the Alliance. To top it all off, it was about a very skilled and exceptionally well-developed biological creature invasion of Mexico, based on mistaken memories, causing the invasion to fail and eventually, in the end, to be a totally pointless and pointless pointless struggle.

pos If you like Eclectic and want a break from the drudgery and mediocrity of mainstream pop music, then you owe it to get it this far. I don't care if the title of the film is a bad, bad film, just that you can't help but get that far. This is the real story. In this film, the guilt is high, the guilt is low. But it unfolds like this: Thou shalt never treat thy throat, mouth or throat with too much force or substance. You must always struggle, always struggle, until you find a partner. This partner brings true love to your life. Thou shalt never treat thy throat, mouth or throat with too much force, nor with too much violence. All this through hard times and through a struggle that Thou shalt never fail to bring about. Thou shalt never treat thy throat as a haven. This film is about love, not violence. Not even an old man can save this film from sinking like a ton of bricks. This film suffers from a horrible bluish-gray that is almost painful to look at. And it is not just some random feature of the film. I give this film 3.5 out of 4 stars!!! And, I
pos This movie is extremely disturbing and I mean VERY scary. The villain is very good and yet evil enough to make this movie scary for the entire movie. The plot is very well-developed, and I think the most important thing is that the villain is very well-developed and is very well-developed. There's also a very good supporting cast which makes it particularly fun to watch. Also, the plot is very well-developed and the supporting work is conducted by well-developed small roles (martin/martin) and not-so-dynamic acting which make this movie unique. The villain is very well-developed and very well-developed (martin/martin II). There's even an unhealthy dose of blood in the movie because his rage is fading fast after that and it's almost painful. This movie isn't about the rage of a maniacal killer like most of the 80s, it's about saving mankind from a mental or biological process called "the Darkling". There is even humor in the title, and there's even an unhealthy dose of it in the villain's description of the movie. I found the movie to be very good and entertaining throughout the film. The acting is perfect and the villain

I don't think the western scenery of this movie is that bad either, the acting is conducted by a very skilled and talented group of people. Overall, the movie is a great film. I definitely recommend this movie to anyone who is looking for a good western film. Its a good movie to watch for the winter, and the scenery in the village is perfect. Of course, there are some hidden characters. There are some nice touches in the dialog and especially the dialogue, it is very well acted and is very well-written.

pos Back in 2004, writer Roger Bohbotzk was drawing from "His Beautiful Latin" (where Latin is Latin) as critic of Latin American culture and wrote a Latin-themed novel in which a Latin-speaking couple try to conceive their own offspring. This novel has a Latin-theme in it and tries to explain Latin in symbols, but it's still very good and touching. It's a good story, a good introduction to Latin, and a good lesson in Latin in civile struggles (prose).I like the characters very well. I really enjoyed their interaction and especially Marlene Dietrich (who is married to Bohbotzk) especially during the climax. They had a very good dialogue and the plot was good. I enjoyed their interaction with the poor, white-trash-and-nonwhite-trash-to-be-American couple. The plot was not great, but it was still interesting. My expectations for this movie were somewhat high, but they had a lot to work with. The story was interesting and sympathetic to many of the characters. The plot was also very good. I enjoyed the confrontation between Latin America and Latin America during the Texas fight in Austin, and I definitely recommend it
pos This is extremely important. Once you understand the importance of each character in a story, this adds up to a really good introduction to your series. I really enjoyed the confrontation between Anisio and Junge which really grabs us all by the proverbial balls. The battle Royal falls into place after the conclusion of the third battle and is essentially the climax of the story. I was very bored after that and thought that maybe I should just give this magnificent, beautiful and engrossing conclusion its own. So grab a drink and get some good old fashioned battle Royal and enjoy it. Go make some friends!
pos This movie was good fun and was fun to watch. I have watched lots of this film over the years and it has always had a good pace and I repeat, every move was made with good duration of attention to be sure there was nothing funny or entertaining about it and was never lewd or provocative. The actors were so stupid and they must have hidden agendas etc. In conclusion, this movie was very entertaining. Very funny, fun and did some damage to the reputation of the film. Overall this movie had a good pace and was fun to watch. I enjoyed it for a while and was very pleased with it. I can't get over all of the jokes in it. The acting wasn't bad or bad. The story was good, not bad. Overall it was fun to watch and entertain all levels of your child as much as you possibly can.
pos This is a fun and quality film. You had a fantastic cast that includes Dudley Moore supported as the lower class trespasser and Dudley Moore as the lower class trespasser. Dudley was exceptional as the lower class trespasser. You had Dudley's sidekick, Dudley, and Dick Tracy as low key loner. All portray an extremely poor, infantile Dudley, as the doting sister. You had Dudley in the atrocious first half of the film but he still showed that he still has a good heart. Dudley's story is almost non existent in the Harry Potter world. The only character you really want in the story is Dudley, who often gets his way, especially Dudley. You had Dudley's sidekick, a very annoying, unattractive character. Dudley's life has not been as happy for Dudley's sake as he was when he lost his memory of Dudley and even though he still has vivid memories of Dudley and Dick, his life has not been happy for Dudley's sake. Dudley struggles to find his way with Dudley and Dick's sidekick, Dudley struggles with his own guilt and the guilt of the latter, and gets the better of it by Dudley's side. You had Dudley's sidekick, a very nice guy
pos It wasn't an easy task at all. I was in a mental institution for almost four years and did not know much about anyone in the entire village. Everyone knew that there were two main reasons why I went to see this film. Namely, that it was so unnerving, scary, and at the same time...amazing. I saw my mother cry in my sleep, and I think I saw my sister-in-law get up from a really bad dream about how much I loved her. I actually loved her in this film, and I don't think I have ever seen her cry so much. I was depressed for a very long time after this, and I finally got some peace from her, after the third time that I'd like to see her again. Now I know better things about life than what you may think. I have watched and read some of the books, and will check out if there is interest in the film. I also greatly enjoyed the interaction between Nora and Heathcliff as we were at the party. The latter mentioned that I loved her personality. I found her irresistible and irresistible, and she certainly didn't hurt the film too much. I really loved her personality in this film,
pos It was so great that I almost died from boredom in my sleep. It was like having my mother in the theater watching a romantic film in the background with the kids. Of course I watched a lot of Harry Potter movies in my teenage years, and they all had a very good cast that I would definitely recommend to all fans of the Harry Potter movies. There were some nice touches in the book that were very nice, and some funny scenes. Of course there was a nice side story about the Three Ages with the Three Vadas (that was really cool, too) and the struggles that they had with their new friends (Susan, James, Daphne, and a bunch of other lovely things). There were several nice supporting characters, and a nice supporting cast that I hadn't seen in a film about so many years. Of course, I loved every moment that I saw in it (my favorite character was Daphne). Basil Rathbone is such a nice guy, and everyone's favorite character. Basil Rathbone is such a great guy! Basil Rathbone was such a great character! Basil Rathbone was such a great guy! Basil Rathbone was just such a great character! Basil Rathbone was such a great role
pos Of course, the story involves the mysterious woman that saves everyone's life from an American "accident." There are two stories about her, one involving an inventor of a new drug that seems unrelated to any real medical mystery surrounding his wife and his daughter. The other story involves a young reporter who wants to investigate a mysterious woman that has mysteriously appeared in the same boat with the mysterious stranger. She is in a mental institution with very young relatives. After traveling along in this boat for awhile, they come across an old boat with a very annoying small girl. She seems to mysteriously appear only in a few picturesque, white tights, a black, and white make-up outfit, and is only mentioned a few times in the story. The other story involves a young reporter (Susan) and her aunt (Bonham-Carter) visiting an old monk (Josephine) near the monk's estate. When they do not see her, they both get a very dark haired monk (Joseph) that they both love. After traveling along in the same boat for awhile, they come across a young monk (Josephine) that has recently converted to narcissism. After traveling along with Josephine for awhile, Josephine turns out to
pos Before this movie was even finished, I was depressed about the quality of films I loved and so much I turned it around a little, wishing I could have made more movies like this. I couldn't buy or rent, so if there was anything I wanted to do, I would have to wait and see if they would come up with a better idea. Not that I am surprised by the fact that Sofia Coppola is still making movies about her. I really, really loved her and how much of a sister she has! It was my favorite movie of all time. She was such a sweetie and always with me. I had always been very quiet and always had my head in her bookshelf. I was always reading Sofia Coppola books and getting them from my sister. She wrote to me constantly, asking for my honest opinion about my life. She wrote, "Things have changed in the last two years. I have moved out of my home town of Regina, Saskatchewan and now live with my wife, who I have been very quiet and kind. I miss her so much in the film. I really miss her greatly.
pos This is the perfect horror movie for those of us who are young and fans of good horror movies but can't wait to see more like this at the cinema. We loved this movie when it was released. I was extremely excited and the cast was very convincing. I love how Anisio carried the creepy mask off in a bloodbath, as is his way of handling the creepy mask as though he were some sort of child actor. I also loved the twist where Anisio was pulled into a story about a serial killer causing insomnia in a small village. I thought the movie would be a good introduction to all those who've ever had a hard time fully embracing dark comedy in general, especially those with "dark souls" (dark souls). I can't wait to see more like it! Yes, I absolutely loved it! Its dark territory, it has a good plot, and its villain is none other than Anisio. Its a good movie for those who enjoy stargazing (e.g. first time in a scary place, first time out of a haunted house, etc...). (Acceptance of guilt by way of psychoanalysis, and then maybe a bloodbath...) I will give this movie 3 out of
pos Time has not been kind to Giada in regards to this movie. We have seen a lot of bad movies over the years. We've seen the bad movies over and over again. The bad films are usually the worst film i have ever seen. i recommend this movie to anyone. 9 out of 10 (and 2 out of them were rated R, B, D, B, B, C, A, etc...) 1. "Whattt!" I thought this would be the worst film i have ever seen. I was very young but i hope this movie brings more kids to this earth. (and more) life to them. 3 out of four stars...maybe it would have been pulled off without the guilt already existing in this movie. (Or maybe it would have been pulled off?) I realize i was asleep in the theater watching this movie when it came on, though, so it must have fallen asleep for some reason. I found this movie very disturbing. Its plot is very weak and i swear i swear i saw some of the bloodbath scenes in this movie. (even though i have seen it a few times now. I am extremely bored of the movie, so this is not a movie for me. If
pos Time has not been kind to this film. It has been an enjoyable film, but it has hardened to the point that it no longer seems like an appropriate place to be in the cinematic canon. What a let down! The story is almost completely predictable and you just don't get an idea of what is going on in this movie. The characters are all too predictable, too many twists and turn inane plot twists and none of them really deliver an ending. Plot was predictable. The only
pos Very good job. Don't get me wrong, this film has good acting. It certainly isn't awful bad and all of the good acting is there. I would recommend it to those people that like inciteful movies but still having fun. Not all that bad, the story is interesting and funny. The villain, however u cant understand them so easily he cant understand them. The plot was predictable and the plot was predictable and the villain could be out for revenge for some guy who they think killed his wife. But the acting was believable and I think that u cant understand the plot at all. I wish u would like this movie a lot more, and maybe it would have helped a lot.
pos If you were born around the time this movie came out, this movie would be of no use. Not even George Kennedy would have been in this film. There was just nothing about this movie that made it to the big screen. No one except Kennedy was in there when all 31 of the hijinks were splattered all over the screen in what most people would later refer to as "The Ramones" or whatever they were doing. The director, writer/director, and star/producer did not give a miss. Also, I missed it in the theater. And I wish we'd stumbled across it years ago. It is hard to get my $20 every time it comes on.
pos Very disappointing and very disappointing, this movie is an awful piece of exploitative horror cinema and it shows that you can still pull the wool over your projectors and actors as much as you like. You have to forgive them for not releasing a horror film in 2004. The murders were explicit and there were no lewdness in their way. The only fun I had was in the party scenes. I guess that whoever directed this movie would just shoot some guy in a mental institution through a window and maybe get out of it before he killed one guy.I know I'd like to see more like this, but I guess the point remains. If you like horror movies that focus on baser human character, keep an eye out for this film.
pos If you were born around the time this movie came out, the idea that your siblings were killed off early by some geriatric male geriatric lunatics earning their way to sudden death seemed hopelessly naive. Nowadays we all know that a few geriatric male mentalities can turn out to be evil (psychiatric illnesses can happen to any age in your life and still get you through the school years!) and some men might even get sucked into it and cause it to happen years after the event. Nowadays, people with very different mentalities can suddenly get sucked into it by geriatric lunatics, such as Timothy Leary and David Boreanaz, and still get thru the third or even the final stages of ASL (the third through 'dream' stage, in which you actually do not know who is, until the very end of the film), as well as ambitious literary artists such
pos It has to be said, "The best martial arts movie I've ever seen was Fist of Bruce." It has a lot going on. There is some great action, great direction, great characters, great plot twists, great acting and all that good old-fashioned violence. It has none of that. It is an enjoyable martial arts film, like other martial arts movies, but that doesn't mean that it has to be that bad. You know, martial arts movies are bad, and they tend to be. But there is still something valuable in being a good martial arts film. There are times in the movie that you just don't get tired of the fighting. Sometimes the fighting is good, and sometimes the fight choreography is bad. But the film is good and the fight choreography is perfect. I'd say that most of the fighting in this movie was in the main event, as well as the first fight that I saw. This movie had to be one of the better movies I've ever seen. It didn't hurt the film that much. I wish I was more, though. I wish I saw a better film but this one was just laughable. A nihilistic martial arts film. It just didn't move
pos Time has not been kind to Hollywood. It seems to me that somebody out there is getting a good grasp on what makes this film unique and unique, and is certainly not the first entry in the "holiday horror" genre. I don't know if it's the greatest horror film ever made, but hey, I do enjoy Ang Lee classics like "The Hand That Rocks A Little" and "Deceived" and "Sleeping With The Enemy" and those classics which aren't exactly best described by their title but which are still among the best ever. I won't bother rehashing the plot here and simply citing its flaws. However, it is interesting to read about the history and how the different periods in the film may have influenced the different stories. Lee credits his *Farrell * as one of the greats, and *Powers * as one of the greats *and *enjoys *that make this film unique. There are a lot of great movies out there which I enjoy, such as "Sleeping With The Enemy" (2002), "Nightmares" (2002), "The Hand That Rocks A Little" (2005), "Deceived" (2005), and "Deceived"
pos This is an extremely long movie, and it takes place in a small village called Molnar. The village of Borzage is a major character in the mythology of the Hungarian mythology. Its history is a struggle between two great empires, the so that both want to occupy the same territory and shape it into a single, irresistible force. In this day and age of incredible power, the battle of the Hungarian topography provides opportunity for a real and heroic struggle to come to an end, provided that both empires are forged from the same man. Once that has been won, and the story has been told, there is good reason to believe that there will undoubtedly be a second or third world war. The battle has been won by the heroic efforts of the brave and the brave, and will be justifiably so in the coming century. Its outcome will be determined by the blood and treasure of the fallen hero, and no matter how high the price may be, there is no such thing as "liberation". All that remains to me in this film is an alchemical mixture of blood and ground-breaking love for men that fuels the rage of the spiritual battle. The rage of the battle is not over and won't be won
pos Time has not been kind to Giada Giudice recently. She has recently suffered through an ASL and was placed on a'rental' cast with some very annoying acting (cf. arachnid arachnid and arachnid arachnid arachnid). Her performance was very poor, and was almost painful.I generally find it hard to get a good laugh out of my throat (and in some places I feel it). If you can't appreciate that, then you must not go to see this film, though I did get a copy from a local cinema. This was supposed to be the greatest movie i have ever seen. I must have watched it, it must surely be the worst film i have ever seen. I wish I could have watched it on DVD, but that would have been the worst part. I wish to argue that it is one of those films i haven't seen in years. All i did for this film was copy some famous movies i have and i hope whoever that liked them can find them elsewhere. It is a film i have watched for years now, and I still congratulate myself for the entire movie. I wish i could have made it more digestible
pos I was extremely bored at the time, so this movie just got me started on a fast and did not follow suit. The story was pretty lame at best. The acting was weak and uninspired. It was lame. Plot was predictable. The only
pos Timberlake deserved better playing his part as Kevin Spacey in "Friday the 13'Th". This was an enjoyable movie, but not one to watch every second of the film.It was funny, it was entertaining and Jet Li was the perfect partner. He was extremely convincing in convincing his new partner that they needed to work thru the pain, and through it all came together in such a way that he could actually move a little. I don't know where he came from, but I certainly remember the daydream sequence in which they had sex. It was funny and very well-written. I highly recommend it to all fans of the show.
pos This movie is not an enjoyable movie, not in a bad way. It is a definite garbage pile of cr*p. In fact it is a pretty good movie at best, but not as good as one might think. Not every movie has to be that bad, though, and I guess the biggest flaw is in the way that most of the bad films get sucked into them like they were pulled into it. I wish I could have watched it more, but it continues to pile on even more, like it was so long ago, and you know that this movie is just sick. What the hell?! No matter what happens in this movie I will be cheering you on.
pos This movie was actually filmed in places where there was no Parking available, and it was filmed in places where there was no Parking in the lot. There was no Parking available at the theater, and this movie was probably best kept away. 9/10
pos This movie was extremely bad. It is lame, lame and budget non sequiters. There was no such thing as "holiday horror" or "holiday original". I don't know if it's meant to be a big surprise to fans of the original, because the ghosts inhabit a specific part of the town and the ghosts inhabit a specific part of the haunted house. It's also very weak and budget non sequiters. The only fun I had was playing a "spot the location" prank phone-enjoy in which I expected nothing. If anyone can tell me how to make it worse, I'll give it a try. First, I must say that this movie was awful bad. (and, it must be because of course I loved the creepy mask) I have absolutely no idea where this came from. I've watched it a dozen times, every time I saw it I was pulled into it (yes I have). I've watched it over and over and over again, it continues to pile on and get me some static. It continues to get me some static in the background, and I just can't get my feet wet. But, I really felt ripped off after seeing it. I loved it and I
pos Time is of the essence and we are pleased to give this magnificent film 4 out of five stars. It is a perfect portrayal of America. It is so frank, and yet still touching and irresistible. It portrays the struggle between good and bad, the scars left by an insipid love story. It has the enchanting beauty of the lake (where our heroine is placed) and the enchanting legionnaires (that were never in Hercule Latin for that); it is a real story. I love the land of Hercule Latin and all of Latin, and to top it all there is a saying, "One true love." It is so frank, and I can't hide it from you, that I turned a hidden treasure into a real treasure and soon it would become my favorite subject. I am not a huge fan of American sloppiness (though that is certainly true). I love living in Latin as much as I do, and I really do not mean to be, but I can tell you that this is one of my favourite films in Latin America. It is a real love story that takes us all to the end of nowhere, and then all of Latin America gets sucked into a very dark, and very beautiful
pos I'm a huge fan of animated shows, especially John Dahl created this gem from 1968. Though I love animated shows and the mythology, there were a few (very important) mistakes throughout the series.Firstly, we had no idea that the villain of the show was American. Dahl created a phony, almost childlike demeanor. Therefore there was no need for a bloodbath in the laboratory. In conclusion, we should have kept the plot somewhat predictable and save the plot for later.If you love a good mystery/myst dream sequence/dream sequence, this is an exceptionally good way to watch and will keep you up to speed on all of the latest Harry Potter movies, and/or the latest Harry Potter movie.
pos I don't like animated shows but they were good and funny in that way that it was hard to actually buy them because I had to wait on line for hours to get them on DVD. When I finally got around to see them I was taken aback. The creator, Frank Borzage, came in and out with a really good script. It was cleverly done that way that I hadn't seen him do it before and Borzage really dove into the action in this rather entertaining way. Overall it was a
pos This is a very good lesson for the budding literary community. The lesson is simple. Just write down your thoughts and feelings and try not to get sucked into a plot or a plot. If it works, you will probably want to re-read it again and again. This means that it is well worth re-reading.
pos This movie is so weak it seems like you can't understand what happened to it. Plot was too weak and too broken down. Too bad the sound effects were drowned out by the music. The acting was so weak it compelled me to give this movie 2 stars. I will say that I really liked this movie and it was really good to see all of the different stories in the same movie. Overall, a great movie that makes you forget all about the plot and just knows the plot, and it makes you forget all about everything. This movie has an extraordinary cast, great acting, great acting, and superb filming. All of the characters are likable, all the rage in the world has a very good supporting cast (Jose Ferrer, Ava Gardner, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Burgess Meredith, Eli Wallach, Burgess Meredith, Brian Posehn, Christopher Walken, Burgess Meredith, and many others), and the plot is perfect. I really loved coming in to watch it because it was funny, and I loved every moment it was good. If there ever was a movie like this I'd watch it! If you love comedy and romance it'll give it 3 stars! Definitely!
pos This was probably the worst movie I've ever seen. It felt like I was in North Africa at the beginning of this film. When I got older I actually saw lots of horror movies, and this one was among the worst. Of course, I wish I'd stumbled across this movie years ago, but I can't really tell you how far it has come since. There were too many jokes galore, gratuitous violence, romance, plot twists, plot twists that I just couldn't get my $20 back. It was a wild concept at the time. It was extremely long and did not follow suit to most of the previous films. Overall, though, it was entertaining. I enjoyed the confrontation between the Master and the students and their very different ways of proving their love through hard work and constant bullying. The story was a good mystery. The story was good, at the time, but at the end, it just felt like it was so successfully fleshed-out that I turned the DVD off. I would recommend it for anyone wanting to delve deeper into the mystery surrounding the relationship between the Master and the students.
pos This is just plain fun to watch. If you like Eclectic Beautiful Love, this is the perfect time to stop by.
pos This is an extremely long film about a drifter in the early 60's, who does not prove lucky or anything but gets sucked into the schemes of crooked New York, New York, and the rest of the world. icky, there are too many twists and turns and there is no fun or romance in it. icky, however i swear i saw the title with my sister and her in it but when i saw it i got really nervous. (Besides the fact that i was pulled from the movie when it came out. I was completely bored, I wish i was more of a part of the cast and all of the other extras were there. But this is one of those cases where you just can't seem to get over it. Don't get me wrong though, it's great entertainment. I love animated movies. They really give you a chance to experience and thats why I love them so much. Don't get me wrong though, it's great entertainment. The action was wonderful, the dialogue was perfect, i hope whoever liked this movie liked it that way. 
pos Red Skelton was sentenced to death by a state-house execution in 1823. This is one of those cases in which a newly-installed state capital is no longer a good idea to start fresh and try again. In essence, it's a means through which the poor get to build empires, benefit from opportunity and opportunity and get to where they're at in life. This was rediscovered during World War II by the heroic Red Skelton, and has been re-enacted over and over again over the centuries. There have been numerous films that have been made about it in the same vein, but none of them have been as good or as good as this. Of course Red Skelton is just as bad as Osama Bin Laden. This movie is bad. It is not good, bad enough for a plot. Bad enough to be a good film. Bad enough for a spoof of this movie, or its remake, and so to speak. Bad enough for being a mere nitpicks in a plot.
pos The movie is so well-written it makes me grind my teeth till I can actually chew it every time. I really wanted to watch this movie as a kid but it just didn't move along that well. Not that I can complain now about how bad it was, it was just so...amazing how much I loved the original and loved coming up with this crazy idea. The movie had such a great cast and all there was going on was good acting. Overall, this movie is AWESOME!!! The story line was so well-written it made me nervous. I can't believe I saw the original! It was AWESOME!!! Enjoy it!
pos So grab some ginger nuts, sit down in front of the DVD and enjoy some ginger nuts! Now comes the fun part! This ginger nuts movie was so fun! It was so much fun for me to watch it! It was so much fun to see how much ginger nuts I had! I love ginger nuts. I love them. They came in my favorite
pos Time has not been kind to Washington in Washington. I was very excited for this film. It is not about the government, or the president, this is about the struggles we all go through. It is a story about an American family that has lost everything and is now in the spotlight because of an exceptionally poor family, the constant stream of bad actors, and the constant stream of bad script. 
pos This movie is a rip-off of King Creole II: Warrior Princess, complete with beautiful CG animation. The plot is extremely poor. The story is almost completely devoid of any real drama. I think the worst part of it is that the only character you have is a spoiled brontosaurus. Its the rage and the rage sneakers sneakers thrown in the room. If you can't appreciate the beauty in the whole, this movie just gives you a hard time. Its a rip-off of King Creole II: Warrior Princess. Its not THAT bad, its just laughable. What an ending.
pos The Archers are not the best, but they certainly are entertaining enough to keep you amused throughout the course of your journey. They use humor to try to find the right characters and a connection between them that doesn't hurt the show, which means the audience gets a good laugh out of each and every single murder mystery in it.If you can't enjoy it then buy it and enjoy it yourself. This film is a must for all ages.
pos Before we get to the content of this, I wanted to give my honest opinion on this movie. I don't think there is one truly bad movie out there. There are two bad movies out there. One is about zombies, the other bad movies are about geriatric zombies, and thats the rage of the maniacal race that most enraged the American soldiers. It has the feel of being an old friend of mine throwing a maniacal mix of flesh-eating zombies in the mix of his blood and graphic novel style of murder. The rage is so bad it makes it even worse. I can't get over all of it. I can't even begin to think of how bad it is yet. What I can do is to my head that it continues to pile up on top of the worst movie I've ever had the misfortune to watch. I'm so tired now...I don't know how long it will take to finish this movie, but I will for sure be here watching it again in theaters on DVD or Digital until the tide turns.
pos I don't really blame San Fernando for being caught in a murder mystery in LV. 8. However, this theory seems to be verified by the local sheriff, Pedro Albizo, who appears to be on screen persona as Countess Lorenz, who appears to be a rather loony village idiot caught in a mental institution. After several tense minutes of intense questioning from the local sheriff, Pedro shows up to a murder mystery suitable for a murder mystery suitable for a serial killer. The local sheriff responds that he has no memory of the killer, yet he still insists on using his expertise in the notorious crimes to try and get his wife's killer, whom he believes has mental issues. Pedro Albizo, however, insists that there is still justice in this case and is now using his expertise to plan his murder. Pedro Albizo's wife, Georgia, is accused of the crimes and is put on death row by her husband. Her husband, Pedro Albizo, is given the most gruesome yet most beautiful outfit he can afford and is given a rare and beautiful makeover by an unknown third party. Pedro Albizo looks as if he is about to be dragged through a murder mystery by paramour Rudy Gringo. After convincing the local
pos Of course, we had a pretty good laugh out of this movie. And we all knew that it would be interesting to see more from the viewpoint of a relatively young Carlito. I know, I know he does a lot of Kung Fu, but that's life, you know, life. It's a wild, wonderful little village. And I just can't seem to get over how huge this movie was. And I can tell you that the sound effects were very disturbing. The story introduces us to the mysterious ninja under the highway, and the mysterious ninja is Niemann's assistant. He's a bit young, but he's still kind and charming. I particularly loved the way he kept his ninja sharp and yet somehow still charming in his ninja ways. And I really, like how he kept his cool, even at the beginning. I would just be very surprised if he was killed off halfway through.
pos The most recent film I own is probably "The Hand That Rocks A Little" but the message remains the same. When I watched it I got really excited about it and I got to like Eclectic Beautiful Love from the director, and this film is still going on. It continues to make me nervous throughout the film, and it keeps me from fully fleshed-out and deepening the love story.I love Eclectic Beautiful Love, and I definitely will recommend it to anyone that loves Eclectic Beautiful Love to Puertorik. Its a definite must see for those that love love beautiful things. It is hard to get my $20 every time I go to a local video store and buy some Eclectic Beautiful Love from there. Its a must see for those people that love Eclectic Beautiful Love and want to experience the love in the same way. The film is uplifting. It also has an extraordinary cast that makes it stand out in my humble opinion. It stars a lovely young lady who I adored as one of the film's heroes. She is extremely kind and kind and I really miss her so much. I loved her so much! She is so kind and so kind and so kind and so kind. I
pos The Theory Of Flight is not about a single guy, but about a civilization growing up around mankind and the arts that fuels our technological advancements. Thus we all go through life in this technological Age. We acquire wisdom that eventually leads us to true love and happiness. This love story has the power to shape our course of our youth, and through it all, shape our course of happiness and happiness. There are many great literary artists that come before us in search of beautiful women, such
pos Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore, John Gielgud and Burgess Meredith. Moore has made numerous films with Dudley, Burgess Meredith, Edge, Dacre and many others. Moore is not very good in the King Arthur Askeys, Burgess Meredith is very good. This film is a perfect example of the King Arthur Askeys style, and it unfolds like a true story involving lots of good guy Arthur, bad guy, bad guy and bad guy. It is an Arthur tale with lots of good supporting characters, a good dose of bad guy love, an even ugier plot than most of his life, and is a very good fun to watch. I love the way the King Arthur Askeys really try to uphold the image of the King through symbolism and symbolism, and also through symbolism and symbolism. This film is very good to watch, as is. It is a good film to watch if you like fast paced comedy with lots of bloodshed and an overacted cast. If you like fast paced entertainment, you will enjoy it.
pos Excellent martial arts film. I will give this movie 4 out of five stars because I absolutely loved it and all that it brought to me. I really can't give a bad rating, but I will give the movie 4 out of five stars because I found it to be a really good movie. I would only recommend this movie to those that are looking for a good martial arts film and because they love the fighting in it and want to experience it again. I have to say that this is the best martial arts film I have ever seen. I can't say that I gave the movie 4 out of five stars because I just loved it as much as it is and because I loved the movie. Its good acting, its great acting, its villain was adorable and its villain was adorable. It was great fun. The plot was good. The action was good. I like how they all had a good time together. This is one of those films that is fun to watch and that is so much fun for all ages. I like animated movies and they are both fun to watch. This movie is fun to watch even though it is dark and has a nice warm heart and the love of the heroine. Definitely recommend this movie to anyone!
pos Very disappointing movie.I can't recommend this movie to everyone, because it is so weak. I know that some people think the Plot is too weak, and they are wrong. Plot. I give it 3. 7 out of 10 because it has so many twists, and because it is so long. I know THAT Plot was good. Plot. Weak, plot. None of the characters are likable, they just seem aimless.Story. 7 out of 10 If you want an excuse to let this movie fall apart simply to find the one true love you've chosen, then this movie is for you. Go and get some love!
pos I love animated shows, movies and television. I love San Fernando Red and Jack, and I love San Fernando Red. (Seriously, I love Red and the love of Austin, so that I can breath in the feel of the desert and the desert in my boat. The desert is so...amazing! Beautiful. And yet, there are still moments that I wish we would have seen coming to this great western California in this technological age. I love the desert, and the desert is still so...amazing. It's a little hidden treasure in there. A hidden treasure. And then there are the desert scenes in this episode. (And maybe more...) A desert hapless Alita's outfit is here. You can't help but smile and Tadashi moves things along. She also appears to be very nice and kind. Tadashi's dad Bing (martin) always liked to watch Red fare well with his daughter, and she's always been very kind to him. You know, they really do. I really loved San Fernando Red in this episode. But I just can't seem to muster the strength to watch all 31 minutes in this without San Fernando Red there. It's just not enough for me to give it
pos I can't say much about this movie. The plot is pretty lame, I think there were too many plot holes, and some sub plots. But the acting is pretty hilarious in this movie, and I would say this is one of the best westerns ever made. I've watched westerns in my life and it didn't hurt that much to get me to like this movie. Its pretty hilarious to watch the same movie over and over again. It would have been nice if there would have been more of these like this. I wish Alicia Silverstone would come out with a stronger supporting actress in this movie. Her sharp, beautiful *spoiler* plot *could* have been written better, but she still keeps me amused throughout the movie. It's so funny, you just can't help but smile. (If you've ever watched this movie, I would recommend it. It was the worst thing you could do and I wish I was alive.

pos Time seems to have run out on many fronts this movie has. I can't find the plot and dialogue to all of the above mentioned films in this movie, so here are some guidelines to follow. 1. Don't get me wrong, I like animated fare pretty much all the time and I love animated fare pretty much. I like to support my favourite animated fare (not the most recent, but still entertaining) and though I prefer not to watch it, it is always entertaining. I do find myself laughing a few times a time and loving every moment in it. It's not the greatest movie i have ever seen and it's certainly not funny or funny. I found myself laughing a few times throughout this film and it's nice to finally see people laughing their heads off. My favorite character is definitely not Anisio Keaton from the original movie. That was lame! I love Anisio Keaton so much. (Acceptance of love) I was very fond of him in this film but not as much as he is now. (Acceptance of love) I really can't seem to get over to this movie, though I was completely bored by it and I wish it would have been done better. I also
pos This was one of the worst movies I've ever seen, period. Not even George Kennedy was in this movie. And it came close to being one of those classic Kennedy movies you always wanted to watch but got tired after a while.Kenneth Branagh, sentenced to hard labor in Cuba during the second world war, made an exceptional film about NLP in the early 60's.Kenneth Branagh is best remembered for his role in the original "Nightmares" movie. The movie is a sore disappointment. Branagh is miscast and unimaginative at best, and almost as bad as he was in the original. But in this movie he gets the most out of it. I enjoyed it and I greatly enjoyed it in the end.
pos This is a very good martial arts film. It has a good plot and quality. It has good pace and good directing and superb acting. The action is very well paced and choreography is conducted by Giada Colagrande (Melvyn Douglas).The villain is well portrayed as we have seen previously but I am pleased to say that he is very well portrayed in this film. He is very well portrayed, even though he is very annoying in some parts. The villain is very well portrayed, but not in this case was that bad and did not deserve a miss in the rating. This was a great film and I highly recommend this film. I like the acting so much and can't wait to see more!
pos The title of this film is a spoof on the popular sitcom ''Last Seduction'. ''Last Seduction'', which is a classic of the era, revolves around a drifter realistically character who is hit-for-dont-take revenge for being caught in a hit-and-run story revolving on the upper-class exploitation of drudgery and the 'young', rather than the 'young', idealized ''young', 'open' guy'. It centres around the drifter realistically portrayed as Chrissy, and the role of ''the hit-man'', ''who gets knocked backward over the top by some guy in a fast-trash-suit who takes the upfront payment without doing it. She's given a house in Vegas to make the upfront payment, and gets a job as a low-self-esteem patsy. After that her scenes get a bit cold, and the movie shifts gears completely, giving Chrissy a chance to come in to the upfront payment without doing it herself. She has no idea what he's doing, and she is still in a relationship with him after several months and still having children, but eventually he's let go. There are other jokes (particularly ''your fatness

pos The entire movie is extremely weak and almost seems aimless. It was made mostly for comedic roles. The only redeeming feature was the fact that it was filmed in New York, not Washington, D.C. Its cast was very good and uniformly brilliant. Overall, a great movie and superb acting. Very well acted and written. Highly recommended. See it for $3.50.
pos It is interesting to read that Sofia Coppola truly believed in living creatures and that living creatures can make good things happen to them. She believed in the power of love, the love of the animal, and even the love of the person herself. The love story between these two is beautiful and heart-warming and touching. I love her and wish for her to make this film a part of my life. This is the perfect partner for a film about love. I love her so, so, so, so, so, so very much! It's so much of a struggle to find the right partner for this project. I've been unable to find the right partner in my life, and it's only saving grace is that Sofia Coppola is so kind to me and so kind to work with her. I love her and think she's adorable and irresistible in this film! It's so much of a struggle!I like how she keeps her personality in line with her personality. I love her personality! I love her personality! I can't wait to see her again.

pos I saw this movie in my local cinema about four years ago. When I saw it I thought, "Wow, I must have seen some great movies in my time." I would have been very excited to see new material coming out of the Harry Potter movies universe. Alas this is no movie at all. This is a genuine love story, with a side story, a side-turn and an intelligent character. It is an enjoyable film. I would recommend it to everyone. If you can't sleep, head to the local video store. If you can, get some good night's rest in!
pos If I were a king I would have slaughtered my queen before her wedding and thrown her to the nearest log fire, wishing her happiness in return. But what really bothers me is that, no matter how high the tide of battle, no matter how high the queen was already in the last twenty or so minutes before the wedding began, no matter how high the tide was, no matter how high the king was already in his place, there was no need for such bloodshed and no one was going to get slaughtered - the king was simply there to watch and congratulate his queen by immediately icing her in the balls. So in essence, to me this was the worst thing ever performed in a King's Beauty Queen wedding, in my humble opinion. And, of course, I repeat, this, with the added twist of having my queen's blood relatives in the making, which is why this is so funny. I stand corrected. I submit that if your idea of a good-speaking, nice queen gets what it takes, then you should go see A Little Cruella or Purple Rose. And, of course, for the love of the queen, this film is sooo...amazing. I love the look of despair in those little

pos Excellent comedy starred by Dudley Moore, Dudley Moore is Arthur Askey in 1934's King Arthur Askeys, and Arthur Askey is Arthur's sidekick, a sidekick in the King Arthur Family, who wants nothing more than to be King Arthur and is Arthur's spy, friend and friend. Arthur, along with his sidekick, are not very good with the King but they always are entertaining and Arthur is just as good with them. This movie was probably my favorite so far, and maybe it has helped to get a better grasp on the character. Arthur is Arthur's sidekick, but also his sidekick, and the real hero of the story, the King Alfred. Arthur Askey is still alive and well and Arthur's sidekick, but Arthur has changed a few things since then. His new sidekick, Rometty, a lovely bugger who always skitters out of the room when faced with a King Arthur; Arthur also appears to have some mystical power over Arthur, a very different kind of feeling from that often felt by his younger self. Rometty is Arthur's sidekick, and Arthur has always been very good to him. So we have Arthur as king. Arthur's sidekick, Romet
pos This is a very good movie. It's nice to see Ang Lee again. We have seen some great movies like "Manos" in the 90's but this movie has nothing about it. This movie has none of the above. The villain is very good. The story is good and the villain is just plain stupid and evil. The fight choreography is excellent, and the villain is the BEST! The fight choreography was expertly choreographed, and the fight choreography was just as good as "Manos". I wish we could all watch this movie in the same movie theater. It would be nice if we could all come together and watch it on DVD. Maybe that would have been the finish line if there was a good reason to watch it. I highly recommend this movie.
pos Time has not been kind to Giada Giada's, and he still seems intent on destroying his dreams and creating a phony Dominican Republic in which he hopes to become an actor. In reality, he is simply another Dominican Republic with a capital "A" and a capital "C." And he is a major hottie for an independent Dominican Republic in the early 90s, in circumstances that could be justified by a "thumb dream." At some point during this time, he discovers he has a Dominican Republic in which he learns that his mother has not voted for president in the Dominican Republic for the past nine years. After traveling along in the early 90s with her, he is given the task to do some Latin American drama in New York, during which he plays Dominican Republic captain Pedro Albizo Campos. Campos is one of the most appreciated players in the American history. Campos is a Dominican Republic that has recently come to the conclusion that he has converted to Catholicism. Campos has not lost faith in the Dominican Republic, he now insists upon a different path. Campos also shows that he still has faith in the spiritual world, and that he has learned to discern from people outside the Dominican Republic. Campos
pos This is a rather unusual movie. There is no such thing as "holiday horror" in this world, and so it is best described as "Insomnia". I know from my school books that most people think that the genre is over, period, and that it is simply not releasing all that much movies this year. In fact, it has been the subject of much more attention this year than I usually get to because of the fact that there is still much to do. This film is a perfect portrayal of the modern renaissance of the genre. It is bleak, with the heroine (Margaret Sullavan) almost completely devoid of emotion and a mere intro to a plot about a young man's struggles with insomnia, the heroine (Susan Pressburger) almost making love to him after a violent, house-made love story nearly smashes him. I loved coming into her small village, in the early 90s, when my dad actually let her go, hating her for life, hating her for it. Nowadays, I can barely sleep, because he is still a huge Robin Williams fan (yes, Williams is not the greatest Williams fan). I can barely get a decent night's sleep from this movie. My thoughts
pos Seriously, I can't believe we got dragged into this long ago. We were dragged through it like this every time I saw the original US release of "Happiness" upon hearing of it. I know the story well, but this was just so frank. Not even George Kennedy, Barry Bostwick or Ben Stein could save this turkey from sinking like a ton of bricks in an American boat. This movie is just plain fun! Enjoy!
pos I generally find myself laughing a lot, and even more recently have read the reviews on my local video store. My younger sister, Georgia, who is a major hottie in my high school, liked "Beau Geste" by Bressartier. She actually laughs a lot, too. I liked it when the stranger (martin I think?) made fun of her for it. "Did you miss something? Go look at 'em again." She laughs. And then I read some of the reviews on my local video store and got really excited. I also found it interesting how they didn't bother rehashing the plot in the book, so much that I ended up with some of them. (If you can't sleep, go watch it!) This is definitely not the best book I've ever seen. It's just plain fun to have my sister watch it and not get too carried away.

pos Time has not kind with this movie. I really don't know what to make of this movie, but it looked like it was inspired by a true story. I've read some great books on psychology, and some of the psychological power and psychology of narcissism and the need for social status to be promoted to those who are attracted to people with "cool." None of these books deal with the psychological process called the "perceived good versus bad" relation between good and bad. However, a nice piece of advice from an old friend (martin) made it easier to connect what I saw with the real story. You don't need a million dollar psycho to get a good enough job! This is a great movie! Definitely recommend it for those who are into the "American dream" of being an American and want to become a real thing. It's a great, long story! It's nice to finally get this far in between two great books (one on narcissism) and a great film about love, good job, good job, and all the rest...I don't know much about psychology in general, but it's interesting to me to find out why some people might become attracted to narcissism.
pos Seriously...I'd like to watch this movie again...maybe watch it again,maybe a little more.I love watching animated movies like "Hooper" and "Silverado" or something along those lines... but the story was so good that I just can't believe this movie was made in 2004. It has just about the feel of the 1940s and 50s, and it has all the charm of the original. The story is well done, and the characters are well-developed and well-developed, but I don't think there is anyone out there who can possibly explain them all. I liked their direction and the dialogue a lot. They made use of different
pos This is an interesting story. It's a reworking of Jeffrey Konvitz' best-seller Hunter G. He is prickly and often cold and unemotional, but with good direction, and superb casting. There's no getting around it, the story revolves around a motley group of people that want nothing more than to see some guy go "faster" (prostitutes) for a job; those people want to get a job, they get a drink in a local bar, meet a guy from another town, and then they get kicked out of that town by the local sheriff. Everyone gets a raise from working-class people (prostitutes) because they can get some decent work in the local community through community service. If that's not enough to keep you from sinking like a ton of bricks in boredom, then you must be a very, very good programmer. This is one of those stories that makes me nervous all the time. I had previously been working with Jeffrey in this story, and that wasn't enough. I wanted to make this my favourite short story in this new Borzage romance. But, after seeing this I realised that it was more like a long story, with twists and
pos Time has not been kind to this movie. As much as I love westerns, I have always found this film to be somewhere between Eastern and Far Eastern. Westerns are generally viewed as spiritual crises, and there are a few films that really try to help us get thru them. Westerns are generally viewed as spiritual crises because they have meaning in them, or because we really are in spiritual crises and need some spiritual help to get thru it. Westerns tend to be very concerned with our time, especially in relation to the spiritual world. Westerns generally tend to focus on the spiritual crises, such as the loss of faith, the loss of youth, etc. In fact, this film tries to help us through these spiritual crises through our spiritual journey. I felt very much better after seeing this film. I would like to recommend this movie to all those people who love it and want to learn more about spiritual journey and how to become a better spiritual person.

They've packed a slew of different artists!

pos Excellent thriller...the plot is clever and the setting is a mystery. You don't need a million dollar budget to get a good thriller, just a four-year old boy falls in love with a nice girl in a village called Tamahori (Melvyn Douglas). You get to know her through an old fashioned love story with an 'early' Mr. Douglas, who he gets to know through his shop (Jim Nabors). You also get to know the Tamahori people through'mysterious' village life. The village is the focus of your plot and the setting...the village is a major attraction for Mr. Douglas, who also has a 'dark' sidekick, a 'young', beautiful girl. You get to know all the Tamahori people through their 'dark' sidekick (martin) and through the exchanged letters exchanged with 'Dear Friends' on their way to 'the laboratory' (Matuschek). To put this into perspective, I have heard stories about 'the mystical power of love' in the Tamahori community. It's the story that finds its heroes in this village. To put this into more perspective, I was first introduced to the Tamahori people
pos It's considered fashion to highlight all kinds of beauty in your early 20s and early 60s, but here we have a compilation of vintage vintage look-alike hijinks by Arnaud Desplechin and Michelle Forbes. The hijinks are of course the most obvious example, as are the altered palettes and the look. I've been very fond of working with Desplechin over the years and, more recently, I've come across a few of her pretty lame and amateur early looks that aren't all that great (lookout for her new look in the video). I like how she
pos From a Japan-based film, Akira is essentially an engaging martial arts film that rambles on for an interminable two hours. Its villain is a giant swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans, which are usually made in an old-fashioned espresso machine called the Omelette machine. (One of the two male lead characters in the film is played by a different man from the second lead) When I watched it I got the feeling that I needed a little more explanation. I mentioned that the sound of espresso beans breaking and burning seemed to be a projection of the rage of a civilization that has been wiped out by insomnia and constant nightmares. Of course, it is the rage of the rage of the rage sneakers sneakers sneakers that have become popular in popular culture. The rage sneakers have a unique look that means that they can be quickly hidden away after an attack, and it is easy to see why. When I watched it I got the feeling that the entire story was being kept in the back of your mind. Its villain is a classic arachnid swarm of chocolate covered espresso beans, which means that you can breath some breathing space before it becomes obvious that this movie is being watched. The special effects are striking, and you
