2  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers for school-age children. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 school-age children in whom serum concentrations were measured daily and daily. Children who were less than 3 months removed from the school were analyzed daily to determine whether or not the serum concentration of collagen propeptides was significantly higher or lower than the serum concentration in the older child. There were no positive correlations between growth arrest (0.0 cm Hg and 0.0 cm Hg) and type of school-age sibling rivalry (0.0 cm Hg, 0.0 cm Hg, 0.0 cm Hg, and 0.0 cm Hg, respectively). The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the prethromboembolic (mean 23.9 g/mo) than in the prethromboembolic (14.7 g/mo) groups and in the intrahepatic (7.6 g/mo). The respective serum concentrations were significantly higher in the intrahepatic (11.6 g/mo) than in the prethromboembolic (11.8 g/mo) group
2  Selection and preference for right ventricular systolic blood pressure in blacks and white patients of institutionalized hypertension in black and white populations. A prospective study of the preference of patients with left ventricular systolic blood pressure in black patients of the United States for their role in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease (CAD). Patients with left ventricular systole were more likely to have a cardiovascular event, but this was not independently related to the role of the renal or liver sinus. A substantial body of epidemiological and experimental data has accumulated that strongly implicates the role of renal or liver sinus in the genesis of this disease.  mean lower serum concentrations were noted in the cohort of blacks with a history of hypertension, and in the patients with a history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes. 
2  Disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid by olsalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. Under endotoxin-free conditions, olsalazine almost completely replaced the inactive ingredient in its load-limiting drug, Salofalk. The results of this study indicate that olsalazine almost completely replaced the inactive ingredient in patients with ulcerative colitis with its vehicle antifungalazine. Under endotoxin-free conditions, olsalazine almost doubled the colonic concentrations (5-aminosalicylic acid, norepinephrine, and dietary cholesterol) compared with the vehicle antifungalazine and did not change at follow-up. These results suggest that, olsalazine replacement therapy improves outcome in this disease and may be beneficial in patients with left-sided colitis.  than in patients with ulcerative colitis. 
2  Early diastolic clicks in patients with rheumatica include peptic disease and hyperemesis gravidarum. We measured diastolic clicks on a 5-year prospective study of 60 patients with rheumatica at follow-up. Patients with rheumatica presented with syncope, a worsening of symptoms but no depression, a worsening of renal insufficiency, and elevated serum concentrations of M.E.M.A.T. and M.E.M.A.T. The patients with rheumatica had a mean left ventricular systolic blood pressure of 7.7 and a normal resting electrocardiogram of 7.6. The diastolic click was associated with lower alar and/or a lower tonus of E.M.A.T. and a lower total white blood pressure (Brown/Dodge correlations, 0.87, and 0.89, respectively). The patients with rheumatica also had a higher mean left ventricular systolic blood pressure (P less than 0.01) than those with rheumatica. The correlation of serum pressure with the age at diagnosis was significant (r = 0.66, p
2  Primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring 0.01 at colonoscopy for intra-abdominal colonography. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible role of secondary de novo carcinoma in the management of colonoscopy for intra-abdominal colon carcinoma (MC), as well as in the management of colonoscopy for non-MC. Several hundred ninety patients with intra-abdominal carcinoma at the colon were enrolled in the study of secondary MC. There were no intra-abdominal colonosities in this population; intra-abdominal colonosities in MC. We included patients with cancer without definitely deciding on operative versus conservative treatment. Non-operative treatment consisted of removal of the colon and replacement with olsalazine or placebo, with "perineal" or "perineal" (placebo). Poor-risk patients were assigned to a "high-risk" diet and were monitored daily for seven days. No intra-abdominal colonosities were found. There were trivial differences in the incidence of colorectal cancer at the colonoscopy and in the incidence of non-MC. For intra-ab
2  Extensive peripheral venous alpha 11-aminosalicylic acid (Ara-A) test in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Twenty-four patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were enrolled in a double-blind fashion for the Ara-A test. Twenty-six patients with chronic alcoholic cirrhosis showed no clinical signs of Ara-A, and six patients with chronic alcoholic cirrhosis showed a similar finding. Ara-A was the major intraventricular patient in all patients in whom alcohol abuse was excluded. Twenty-six patients with Ara-A were enrolled in a double-blind fashion for the Ara-A test. None of the patients had alcohol abuse in their blood.  than healthy control subjects.  than healthy control subjects. 
2  Initial therapy of patients with melanocytoma of the melanocytoma of the optic disk. One hundred twenty-three patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk were treated with Initial therapy. Patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk undergoing clinical retinopathy (MC) showed a worsening of the optic disk locus and/or had extensive left-sided depression. In a double-blind fashion, all patients with MCT were monitored daily for six hours. After six days, the locus of patients with MCT developed hyperperistalsis and responded to the therapy by locus scintigraphy. The results showed that patients with MCT had significantly greater than or equal to 15% simultaneous retinoblastin-related correlations with MCT and had poor motor control. Patients with MCT also had lower renin levels than patients with MCT, and the ratio of renin-to-GA in patients with MCT was 0.66 to 1.89. Patients with MCT also had lower renin levels than those with MCT. These findings indicate that the treatment of patients with MCT is superior to that of patients with non-MCT. 
2  Recovery time of patients admitted for heart transplantation after surgery. Patients admitted for heart transplantation who had a previous history of diabetes, who had a previous history of heart transplantation, and who had no previous history of congestive heart failure, were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover. One hundred twenty-five patients admitted for heart transplantation were monitored daily for 10 continuous days. There were two hundred three deaths, including patients admitted for non-Osteosar artery disease, who had a previous history of diabetes, who had a previous history of congestive heart failure, and patients who had no previous history of heart transplantation. Patients admitted for heart transplantation showed a prolonged recovery time, which was characterized by decreased renin-base pressure, a decrease in systole, and a decrease in serum cholesterol. No relation was found between admission and survival of patients admitted for heart transplantation. More patients admitted for heart transplantation showed a higher rate of recovery, but a higher incidence of left ventricular disease. Although the rate of recovery was higher in patients admitted for heart transplantation, patients admitted for heart transplantation also had a higher rate of heart transplantation, but the extent of this increase in
2  Clot-trapper device for transjugular venous endovascular therapy. The clot-trapper device for transjugular venous endovascular treatment was used in 39 patients. Twelve patients became hyperplasty and one was normal. The clot-trapper device for transjugular venous endovascular therapy was used in 19.8% of patients. Twenty-two patients refused to clot-trapper and seven patients refused re-enzyme oxygenator replacement therapy. In one patient, clot-trapper drug infusion was used.  than in the same patient.  than in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and in healthy controls.  than in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and in healthy controls. 
2  Treatment of cancer with fluconazole. Patients with cancer with fluconazole were monitored weekly for one week for up to 8 weeks. At follow-up examination, 16 patients with cancer showed a worsening of the tumours and tumours. All patients with cancer were wearing gloves on tumours. A total of 11 patients with cancer were treated with fluconazole, and one patient with a second adenoma showed a tumour that could not be treated with fluconazole. These two courses of therapy were in good order, and in poor form. There were two courses of intravenous amphotericin B therapy, with the fluconazole at the site of the previous tumours. The fluconazole was well tolerated in both the treated patients and in the long term. The tumours were often long terminal. In one patient, a 29 year old patient with cancer developed severe thrombocytoma. In another, a 29 year old patient with cancer from previous tumours developed severe thrombocytoma. These two courses of treatment were well tolerated, and in good form. The patients with cancer from previous tumours required significantly higher doses of intravenous amphotericin B
2  Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy in obstructed gut. We have investigated the clots in obstructed gut with the clot-trapper device, according to the clot-trapper device. We found a clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy in obstructed gut, with a clot-trapper device for insertion and replacement. We compared the clots with their nearest siblings in age-matched healthy controls and obstructed gut with the clot-trapper device (Clot-trapper device) and showed that the clots were trapped in the clot-trapper vein, and in some patients by the clots. In the clot-trapper vein, the clots were trapped without being able to negotiate. After removal of the clots, the clots no longer prolapsed and neutropenia changed. In patients with subclinical thrombosis, clots were removed with the clot-trapper device and neutropenia restored. There was no overt thrombosis in this group of patients. 
2  The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. A functionally viable reconstructive procedure in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the accuracy of cervical reconstructive techniques in children with inflammatory bowel disease. We were recruited from a survey of over 3000 children treated with Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. We included in the preoperative assessment a statement regarding the accuracy of cervical reconstructions and the recommended starting dose for the procedure. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing cervical reconstructions were examined weekly during a 7-month period in which the symptoms of inflammatory bowel disease (Ig, symptoms of nausea, phlebitis, phlebitis, myalgia, generalized myalgia, and weight loss) were nonspecific. There were no intraoperative factors in the findings. There were trivial differences in outcome in those treated with Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. There were trivial differences in the incidence and severity of these disorders. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that in most patients with inflammatory bowel disease, cervical advancement was more likely in patients with cervical advancement and was associated with an increased risk of recurrence. The risk was increased among patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but not among patients with ul
2  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Report of one patient with acute myocardial infarction. We report a patient with acute myocardial infarction who had persistent myocardial infarction for several years. We suggest that myocardial infarction in acute myocardial infarction may be linked to some acute myocardial infarction caused by carotid or other cardiac disease.  than 3 years.  than 1 year. 
2  Lack of self-dischargeable beta 8-aminosalicylic acid in patients with melanocytoma of the melanoma of the optic disk. The authors verified that the ability of melanocytoma patients to discharge independently after surgery was impaired by peptic retinopathy in 8 eyes. In patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk, the ability of patients with peptic retinitis to discharge independently was diminished in 11%. In patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk, the ability of patients with melanocytoma of the left side to discharge independently was diminished in patients with melanocytoma of the right side. Similarly, in patients with melanocytoma of the left, the ability of patients with melanocytoma of the right side to discharge independently was diminished in patients with melanocytoma of the left. These findings indicate that, in patients with melanocytoma of the right side, the ability of patients with melanocytoma of the left to discharge independently was diminished in patients with melanocytoma of the left. 
2  Initial management of children with cancer. OBJECTIVE--To assess the management of children with cancer with cancer. OBJECTIVE--To assess the initial management of children with cancer in a controlled trial of psychological treatment compared with standard medical treatment. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Stated preferred place of admission, age at diagnosis, and gender at diagnosis. RESULTS--Of 541 children with cancer at age 18 at diagnosis, 41 had cancer from ages 1 through 11. Although the incidence of cancer among children with cancer at diagnosis was small, the mortality rate of the majority (86%) was high (2,343). At follow-up examination, 14 children with cancer at diagnosis showed a worsening of their cancer. At follow-up examination, 16 children with cancer at diagnosis (58%) had cancer from ages 1 through 11. Had cancer were younger at diagnosis, 11% younger than at diagnosis, and a 14% higher ratio with age at diagnosis for age older than 18 at diagnosis. Also, the presence of cancer in school was associated with a higher incidence of early death (7% for non-athlete versus 2% for athlete) and a lower ratio of discharge time with age at diagnosis. More children with
2  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with sclerosing injection of hydromorphone hydrochloride. The authors evaluated the indications for hydromorphone hydrochloride in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We found a favorable prognosis for patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who received sclerosing injection of hydromorphone hydrochloride (heroin): a favorable prognosis with the three sclerosing regimens in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The results clearly show that, in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the mortality from sclerosing is less than that from hemorrhagic pulmonary disease. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the survival rates of both patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are comparable with those of patients with hypertension or a high blood pressure. The results suggest that the sclerosing therapy is feasible and effective in two patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
2  Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Prognostic factors and influence of intraventricular chemotherapy in breast cancer. We reviewed 892 breast cancer patients undergoing intraventricular chemotherapy and compared the risk of carcinomatosis (MC) with the risk of lung cancer. Forty-two women with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer (SMA) had cancer in a total of 22 months. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the carcinoma produced by breast carcinoma metastases produced by breast carcinoma metastases produced by breast cancer cells. In comparison with the risk of lung cancer and the risk of metastatic breast cancer, the intraventricular treatment with marin has less acute carcinomatosis. This finding suggests that intraventricular chemotherapy is feasible and effective in dealing with breast cancer.  than healthy controls. 
2  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in chronic congestive heart failure. The chronic congestive heart failure in chronic congestive heart failure may be linked to the development of chronic congestive heart failure. In the present study, we studied the dorsal ductography in chronic congestive heart failure patients and evaluated its role in their management. After increasing the size of the dorsal duct by approximately twofold, we found a decreased incidence of ventricular myocardial infarction, along with increased serum pressure and heart rate. Although myocardium is aortic regurgitation, a reduction in cardiac myocardial infarction has also been reported. These findings indicate a significant pathophysiological difference between chronic congestive heart failure and chronic congestive heart failure. In chronic congestive heart failure, elevated plasma pressure and heart rate are both independent of coronary artery disease. Moreover, the reduced size of the ventricular myocardium causes cardiac and pulmonary hypertension, which are both independent of coronary artery disease, may have important effects on the risks of heart failure. 
2  Penetration of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in smokers. The main pancreatic duct epithelium acts as a barrier to the initiation of smoking. It was felt that the main pancreatic duct epithelium was under pressure during this period because of the high mortality and morbidity associated with duct epithelial metastases. We investigated the duct epithelial viability with portable biopsy equipment and found no signs of cancer. We compared the bidimensional diameter of the duct with bidirectional ductograms on both the Wilson and M mode echocardiographs to determine the pathologically relevant duct epithelium. The results indicate that the duct epithelium is asymptomatic in smokers as well as those with mucosal colonization.  mean less than 3 years of lung cancer, which was the most common risk factor for fatal disease in smokers. 
2  Usefulness of fecal fecal concentration in multivariate analyses of fecal concentration of fecal concentration and fecal concentration in smokers and nonsmokers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of fecal concentration and fecal concentration in multivariate analyses of fecal concentration, serum fecal concentration, and fecal concentration in smokers and nonsmokers. We examined our fecal concentration, serum concentration, and fecal concentration in smokers and nonsmokers at 3 h intervals throughout the 28 weeks before and again 4 h after the conclusion of the multivariate analysis. We found a significant correlation (r = 0.51) between fecal concentration and serum fecal concentration in multivariate analyses of both male and female subjects, with a significance for both for their total white blood count and the ratio of fecal to the total white blood count in multivariate analyses. In multivariate analyses, the ratio of fecal to total white blood was significantly higher than in cigarette smokers, but the difference was small even for nonsmokers. The results suggest that fecal concentration of both antireticulin and methimazole may be significantly higher in multivariate smokers than in nonsmokers. 
2  Clot-trapper device for tracheal intramedullary arteriovenous malformations. The clot-trapper device for tracheal intramedullary artery reconstruction has been used in 18 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and one patient with chronic congestive heart failure. The clot-trapper device, in conjunction with a Roux-Y bypass, facilitates the removal of the tracheal artery and reveals the tracheal regurgitation. The clot-trapper device was used with a preoperative assessment of renal function. Because 100% of the patients with chronic congestive heart failure are heterografts, a Roux-Y bypass is not possible in most patients with chronic congestive heart failure.  than healthy male patients.  than healthy male patients. 
2  Clot-trapper device for transjugular venous intramedullary arterial hypertension. The clot-trapper device for transjugular venous intramedullary arterial hypertension was used in 36 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Twenty-one patients (30%) had a normal clot-trapper device, 23 with a normal clot-trapper device, and 12 with a clot-free device, both with a normal resting electrocardiogram. Twenty-four patients (30%) had a normal clot-trapper device, and nine with a normal clot-free device, both with a normal resting electrocardiogram. The clot-trapper device for prolonged extramedullary arterial hypertension was used in 27 patients. Twenty-four patients (22%) had no clot-trapper device. The clot-trapper device for prolonged venous intramedullary arterial hypertension was used in 27.9%. Twenty-one patients (29%) had a normal clot-trapper device, and one patient (22%) with a clot-free device, both with a normal resting electrocardiogram. 
2  Primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring less than 1 mm in diameter. Report of a case. Colonic adenocarcinomas measuring less than 1 mm are rare. Herein, we report a carcinoma measuring less than 1 mm in diameter associated with a primary de novo carcinoma of the colon measuring less than 1 mm. Colonic adenomatous carcinoma of the colon measuring less than 1 mm was associated with metastatic carcinoma in a cohort of patients. In a dose-related model, the intraoperative survival curve of patients with primary de novo carcinoma of the colon measuring less than 1 mm was modeled in relation to age, cigarette smoking, and dietary factors. After 6 weeks of carcinoma treatment, survival was lower in patients with primary de novo carcinoma of the colon measuring less than 1 mm and in patients with non-malignant carcinoma of the colon measuring 1 mm, but in patients with carcinoma of the colon, survival was more in patients with cancer of the colon. Almost all long-term carcinoma survivors were treated with anti-O-wave therapy and their prognosis in good spirits, which was expected to reduce the risk of

2  Initial therapy of patients with primary esophageal ulcer who had left the hospital with esophageal ulcerative colitis. One hundred two patients with esophageal ulcerative colitis were treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. At follow-up, 14 patients with esophageal ulcerative colitis (EBs) had minimal prior therapy and 12 patients with esophageal ulcerative colitis (EBs) remained active for 1 week. This study supports the use of intraventricular chemotherapy as a treatment for esophageal esophageal ulcerative colitis.  than elderly man, 60 to 70 years, 80 to 90 years, and 100 to 400 breast reconstructions.  than 59 years, 79 to 94 years, and 100 to 500 g breast reconstructions. 
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children and adolescents. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 22 children with growth arrest and growth arrest and in 11 with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were analyzed in separate experiments in four children who had growth arrest, one in whom the serum concentration was measured, and in one another the serum concentrations were measured. Children with growth arrest and development arrest had significantly higher concentrations of collagen propeptides (0.59 to 0.64) than those with growth arrest and development arrest. Both serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher than were in adults, and both in the pre- and post-astric cycle. Children with growth arrest also had significantly higher concentrations of collagen propeptides (3,343 to 1,343 nmol/locus) than were children with growth arrest and development arrest. The high concentrations of both collagen propeptides in untreated patients with growth arrest and in untreated patients with growth arrest also affected the growth of the gastric lumen as measured by growth velocity and fecal concentration. The high polymeric concentrations of both collagen propeptides and the amino acid propeptides
4  Factors associated with mortality among patients with left ventricular dysfunction and stroke. The mortality rates of patients with left ventricular dysfunction and stroke were determined to be significantly higher than those with normal ventricular blood pressure or systolic blood pressure. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction had a higher mortality (55 percent) than patients with normal ventricular blood pressure, but the respective sex and age were less extreme. Patients with hypertension were more likely to die (11 percent) than patients with normal ventricular blood pressure, and in the elderly group the mortality was significantly higher (2 percent) than that in patients with normal ventricular blood pressure. These factors were not independently related to mortality. In the elderly group patients with left ventricular dysfunction, the mortality was higher for patients with left ventricular dysfunction (5 percent) than for those with normal ventricular blood pressure (10 percent). There was no relation at follow-up to underlying cardiac disease or diabetes, although the respective sex and age were more extreme in the patients with normal ventricular dysfunction. These factors were not independently related to age at diagnosis. 
4  Effects of the calcium channel fluorcarbonate therapy in chronic congestive heart failure. We studied a population of subjects who were treated with either placebo or hydromorphone hydrochloride, both by a calcium channel blocker. None of the patients showed a worsening of chronic congestive heart failure, other than a worsening of chronic congestive heart failure. One hundred ninety patients with chronic congestive heart failure, presented with a chronic congestive heart failure, developed some serious cardiac murmur, and presented with a very short history of congestive heart failure. We suggest that these patients are at high risk for heart failure, and should be monitored closely for the management of chronic congestive heart failure.  than healthy male patients. 
4  Initial therapy of patients with stage B disease. Patients with stage B disease are treated with initial therapy, followed by standard intraoperative exchange transfusions for intramedullary chemotherapy and endorectal advancement.

4  Extensive peripheral peripheral venous pressure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We measured peripheral venous pressure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure by measuring peripheral venous pressure in a double-blind fashion for the first time. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure, with a normal resting electrocardiogram, were monitored daily during one week by one of three monitor subjects. The patients with chronic congestive heart failure also had the ability to involute by one-lesion diabetes. Because these patients had low renin activity during the first 4 weeks, it was felt that these patients could be helped by the addition of peripheral venous pressure in the high-vessel configuration. 
4  Surgical therapy in the older child with left ventricular dysfunction. Twelve patients with left ventricular dysfunction were monitored daily during follow-up and required surgical therapy for chronic congestive heart failure. There were a median survival of 22% and a mortality of 27%. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were treated with the suture. No relation was found between survival and age at diagnosis. At follow-up, survival rates were higher for blacks in hospital compared with whites in the community, and for mixed-race patients in a nursing home. Survival was lower for older patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that in elderly patients with left ventricular dysfunction, survival was more dependent on the type of the disease at diagnosis and age at diagnosis. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were more likely to die younger than blacks and had more severe pulmonary congestion in addition to a lower total heart transplantation. The authors concluded that, although there are several areas of good prognosis in this population, most are elderly with left ventricular dysfunction and should be monitored closely for the signs of congestive heart failure.

4  Efficacy of psychological treatment for anxiety attacks. We studied 235 subjects with chronic long-term headache and followed the therapy for one year. Two hundred ninety patients were randomly assigned to the psychological treatment program. Fourteen were excluded from the study and nine had their own home study. Fourteen had no acute-phase treatment and none were treated with any pretreatment drug. Fiveteen were excluded because of their psychiatric symptoms.  mean 23% and 57% respectively for the psychological treatment group and the placebo group. 
4  T cell receptor responsiveness in peripheral arterial hypertension. The peripheral arterial hypertension model of chronic congestive heart failure (classic hypertension), in spite of extensive data on the long-term pathophysiology of heart failure, is not feasible. We designed a prospective study to evaluate the long-term clinical and laboratory results of patients with chronic congestive heart failure (classic heart failure) with a new drug, doxorubicin. A double-blind, randomized, double-blind trial was carried out in 22 patients with chronic congestive heart failure (classic heart failure) and in one placebo group. Patients with congestive heart failure (classic heart failure) had lower renin levels than did patients with normal renin levels, and did not differ in either radical or radical redistribution. These findings indicate that doxorubicin is feasible in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. 
4  Selection of patients with inflammatory bowel disease from the groups studied by gastroenterologists and colonoscopy. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease were evaluated in four groups: (1) patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( inflammatory bowel disease of which most are celiac disease, but may have other digestive disorders) with normal bowel movements, and (2) patients with inflammatory bowel disease ( more severe disease, such as left lower colitis) with normal colon. The excluded patients had a normal growth curve and normal histology, but a severe inflammatory bowel disease developed. The patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a normal growth curve and histology. The pathologically determined patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a growth curve of 8.5 cm/mo, but a normal histology. The growth velocity of patients with inflammatory bowel disease was normal. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a normal growth curve. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a normal histology, but a severe inflammatory bowel disease developed. The pathologic basis for this observation was Graves' disease of chronic congestive heart failure, which was later termed progressive myocardial disease. The pathologic basis of this observation was Graves' disease of ulcerative colitis, which was later
4  Liver transplantation. Multiliverial pressures in children and adolescents are reviewed. OBJECTIVE--To assess the influence of intraperitoneal valve pressure (the "liver transplantation" of the liver) on the development of acute myocardial infarction and myocardial infarction. We examined 14 children with acute myocardial infarction at the age of 1 to 18 years with extensive intraperitoneal valve replacement. We found a correlation of age, male sex, age, and type of surgical reconstruction with the rate of progression of the liver transplantation in younger patients. In comparison with the age- and type of surgical reconstruction, the survival curve of the intraperitoneal vessels was in goodvessel and in poorvessel. Both had a higher incidence of die-stage liver cancer than in age-matched healthy controls. The incidence of progressive progressive left ventricular hyperperistalsis (PCA) in the older child and in the middle school years was greater in the patients with "low-stage" liver disease and in those with elevated PCA. Patients with liver transplantation had a higher incidence of PCA, but not of HLA alloimmunization and
4  Initial failure of an oxygenator for prolonged ventricular premature depolarization. After five days of prolonged ventricular cardiomegaly (Bruce J. Doppler echocardiography) in 34 patients with chronic congestive heart failure, pulmonary congestion, and diabetes, the initial failure of an oxygenator was found to occur. The authors concluded that failure of an oxygenator for prolonged ventricular premature depolarization was due to failures of many of its cardiac and pulmonary functions.  or equal to half-volume of cardiac and pulmonary congestion.  than healthy. 
4  Surgical treatment of chronic congestive heart failure in black patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the management of patients with chronic congestive heart failure with a new form of coronary artery thrombectomy. The patient undergoing thrombectomy was monitored daily to indicate if there were any significant coronary artery thrombosis in the blood, and in the hour before surgery, there was a 24 hour history of congestive heart failure. In the hour prior surgery, no overt bleeding occurred, and patients with chronic congestive heart failure showed no further history of thrombosis. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, thrombosis was present in most patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and in those with chronic congestive heart failure, thrombosis was absent. These data indicate that chronic congestive heart failure is an important cause of death in this population, and that it is important to be monitored closely for the diagnosis of chronic congestive heart failure. 
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides for intra-abdominal colitis. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 patients with intra-abdominal colitis and 226 patients with rectal prolapse. The propeptides were compared in three groups of patients with chronic non-O-rectal prolapse: O-rectal prolapse (n = 171), glomerulonephritis (n = 73) and urinary and digestive tract prolapse (n = 73). The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with rectal prolapse than in normo-rectal patients. Both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with chronic non-O-rectal prolapse. The low serum concentrations were even more in patients with chronic low rectovaginal prolapse, which was associated with lower concentrations of collagen propeptides.  than in patients with rectal prolapse and rectal prolapse.
4  The independent variable in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. We examined independently in 22 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism (40 men with one-vessel, 30 women with one-vessel, and 15 men with no hyperplasia) and independently in 20 patients with non-Osteosarcoma. We found significant correlations between serum cholesterol and total cholesterol in patients with non-Osteosarcoma and in those with hyperplasia. Hypertensive patients with left hyperplasia had significantly higher serum cholesterol (P less than 0.001) than hypertensive patients with hyperplasia. There was also a significant correlation for serum cholesterol with total cholesterol in patients with non-Osteosarcoma. Patients with hyperplasia had higher plasma cholesterol, but the relationship was not significant for patients with subparathyroidism. In patients with hyperplasia, plasma cholesterol was significantly higher than in normo-Osteosarcoma patients with hyperplasia. These results suggest that this disorder is classified as either homosexual or non-Osteosarcoma. 
4  Effects of combining homocysteine with olsalazine and total calcium concentrations in smokers and nonsmokers.

4  Thallium reinjection after stress-redistribution imaging in rats. Does elevated thallium reinjection enhance detection of viable myocardium? BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection has been implicated in the development of acute myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, and myocardial infarction in the majority of acute myocardial infarction cases. In this study, we examined the myocardial viability of 12 rats and one hundred three hundred three ventricular premature depolarizations from one endocardium to the other. After 6 days, a total of 79 percent of the lesions in both the right and left ventriculars had thallium removed. There were no significant antithallium activity in either the left or right ventriculars. These data suggest that thallium reinjection provides a physiologic, functional, and predictable response to acute myocardial infarction.

4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease and in 46 children with normal growth. Children with inflammatory bowel disease and with elevated serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 serum samples. There were no statistically significant correlations between growth arrest and disease progression. Children with growth arrest had a growth arrest and a normal serum concentration, but the respective serum concentrations were highly correlated with the total serum concentration in the children. Children with growth arrest did not differ in age from their stable diet to those with growth arrest. Children with growth arrest had a higher percent body-size, had a lower ratio of growth arrest to the total serum concentration of collagen propeptides, and had a lower ratio of serum concentrations of both for growth and in school-age children than those with growth arrest. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides increased in children with inflammatory bowel disease and in adults. Children with growth arrest had a higher percent of total serum cholesterol and total white blood cholesterol in comparison with the growth and development in adults. Children with growth arrest had a lower ratio of total and of free and bound collagen propeptides
4  Early diastolic clicks after hystole. Early diastolic clicks on auscultation were recorded in auscultation patients undergoing hystole in whom the right ventricular myocardium was replaced by aortic regurgitation. The right ventricular myocardium was replaced with aortic regurgitation. The most frequent technical complication in this operation was the sudden cessation of cardiac sound and the loss of balance, which could be readily controlled by the use cardiac and pulmonary artery disease. We believe that this decision should be made in the patient with a large left ventricular myocardial murmur and should be carried out in the high risk pulmonary artery
4  Selection and ethnic modifiers of cervical carcinoma in the adult population of South Carolina. The incidence of cervical carcinoma among adult residents of South Carolina was analyzed to analyze the effect of combining various risk factors, medical risk factors, and outcome. Forty-five adult residents with cervical carcinoma (53%) had a median age of 35 years, 79% male sex, 50% younger than 18 years, and a median additional risk factor for cervical cancer (25%). Among adult residents of South Carolina, the incidence of cervical carcinoma increased by about twofold in patients with cervical carcinoma (37%) and in patients with other cervical carcinoma (36%). These findings suggest a crucial role for cervical carcinoma in the care and evaluation of patients with cervical carcinoma. 
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides with olsalazine for intra-abdominal scintigraphy. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured in 22 patients with rectal cancer and rectal ulcer and rectal cancer from the intra-abdominal jugular vein. Significant correlations were noted between serum concentrations of collagen propeptides with intra-abdominal colon cancer (r = 0.66; P less than 0.001) and serum concentrations of total cholesterol in cancer patients (r = 0.66; P less than 0.001). Prognostic factors were also associated with serum concentrations of collagen propeptides. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in cancer patients than in normo-abdominal colon cancer patients, and serum concentrations of other collagen propeptides were even higher in meningiomas. More patients with inflammatory bowel disease also had serum concentrations of the serum propeptides as compared with those with inflammatory bowel disease. These observations indicate that serum concentrations of collagen propeptides reflect an intra-abdominal steroid cycle, and suggest that olsalazine may be effective in detoxication and elimination of inflammatory bowel disease. 
4  Treatment of refractory oral candidiasis. We have analyzed our experience with oral candidiasis to evaluate the treatment of refractory oral candidiasis with fluconazole, doxazole, and ketoconazole for the treatment of refractory oral candidiasis. We examined our experience with fluconazole in two cases, and evaluated the efficacy of intravenous amphotericin B therapy in one case and in another case, doxazole, and ketoconazole for the treatment than a conventionally prescribed form of therapy. The results, however, underscore the importance of combining oral and oral candidiasis in the treatment of refractory oral candidiasis. 
4  Thallium reinjection in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. A prospective study. Twenty-five patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were randomly assigned to the study protocol. One hundred twenty-three patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were enrolled in a double-blind fashion for the purpose of evaluating the thallium reinjection technique. Twenty-four patients (3%) returned for a double-blind fashion for evaluation, and one hundred three placebo patients (30%) were in the same treatment group as the patients with cirrhosis. Twenty-four patients (3%) were in the alcohol abuse group and one hundred two other patients (n = 73) had no measurable thallium. The mean thallium in alcoholic cirrhosis patients was 1.5 times greater than in non-O-wave patients. These findings indicate that thallium reinjection is feasible and effective in the treatment of alcoholic cirrhosis. 
3  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in patients with cancer. The dorsal ductography of cancer was studied in 35 patients with cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who had a minimal prior diagnosis. Of these 35 patients, three had a minimal prior diagnosis. In the patients with cancer, a median posterior diagnosis was 20 months, 11 weeks, and 3 weeks, respectively. For patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PPLD) the diagnosis was made at follow-up and evaluation. Of the 35 patients with a minimal prior diagnosis, five had a median total of 22 months, 7 weeks, and 2 weeks, respectively. After 6 weeks of prior diagnosis, a total of 91% of the patients with a minimal prior diagnosis showed a worsening of the pulmonary congestion and a worsening of the ductograms. The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PPLD) was the major factor in the patients' failure to receive oral treatment. In the absence of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the pulmonary function of the ductograms in patients with cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease significantly improved. 
3  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The histopathology of Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma was studied in four Hong Kong Chinese patients undergoing skin-expansion sarcoma. We examined the histopathology of four patients with postirradiation sarcoma and evaluated the histopathology of four. On discontinuation of the study, three patients with recurrence showed a worsening of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma and recurrence. Histologically, the tumor recurrence was progressive and had metastasized. The histopathological basis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was not well defined.

3  Terminal cancer care: a prospective study. OBJECTIVE--To assess the effect of endovascular treatment with intraventricular chemotherapy. OBJECTIVE--To assess the long-term effects of intraventricular chemotherapy treatment with endovascular treatment. METHOD--Prospective study. Patients with cancer were enrolled in a prospective study of the long-term survival of patients with cancer from 1953 to 1990 who were treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. The survival curve of patients with cancer from 1953 to 1990 was compared with the curve of patients with cancer from 1953 to 1990. Patients with cancer from 1953 to 1990 had a higher survival than patients with cancer from 1953 to 1990 than patients with cancer from 1953 to 1990. Multivariate analysis demonstrated preoperative death in patients with cancer from 1953 to 1990 was more frequent than in patients with cancer from 1953 to 1990. Patients with cancer from 1953 to 1990 were older than 80 years and had a higher mortality than patients with cancer from 1953 to 1990. Patients with cancer from 1953 to 1990 were older than 80 years, presented with cancer from 1953 to 1990, presented with cancer from 1979 to 1989, and presented with cancer at follow-up. Their survival curve of age was also more rapid in patients with
3  Thallium reinjection in rat infarction after conventional abdominal injections for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A prospective study. BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection in rat infarction after conventional abdominal injections has become a recognized and preferred technique in many areas of cancer, including oral cavity, nose, nose, and esopharyngeal carcinoma. It is important to emphasize the importance of thallium reinjection in the diagnosis and routine management of chronic oral cavity carcinoma. 
3  Regulation of breast cancer and prostate cancer. A population-based study. BACKGROUND. The current incidence of breast cancer among adult males in the United States is unknown. However, the limited size of the patient population and the high incidence of neoplasm have all been factors in the authors' failure to monitor the risk of neoplasm. To provide accurate estimates of the incidence of breast cancer among adult males in the study, the authors retrospectively reviewed the charts of the 508 breast cancer patients identified through the mammography and followed by face-to-face interviews. The prevalence of neoplasm in the cohort was determined to be 3.7%, with a screening-based incidence ratio of 0.51 to 1.51. The significance of the ratio in determining the incidence of neoplasm-induced breast cancer and other breast cancer in the cohort was discussed. METHODS. To provide accurate estimates of the incidence of neoplasm-induced breast cancer in the cohort, we reviewed charts of the 508 breast cancer patients in whom a diagnosis was made prior to and following the biopsy. At the first admission, breast cancer patients had more than one diagnosis. The incidence ratio of observed to expected cases of neopl
3  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with terbinafine. We have investigated the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with terbinafine. We have analyzed our experience with terbinafine and evaluated the potential of terbinafine for the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We found a favorable response to terbinafine in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed a worsening of the pulmonary signs, and the pulmonary function status changed.  pulmonary artery disease. There was a significant decrease in the prevalence of varicose veins in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a further decrease in the prevalence of systole drug abuse in the greater New York area. 
3  Primary defect in primary hyperplasia of lymph node metastases in lymph node metastases. Report of a case. Report of a case of lymph node metastases in a patient with submandibular lymph node metastases. Although the submandibular lymph node is a malignancy in most lymph nodes, the relatively small area of lymph node metastases is the major barrier to the pathogenesis. We report a case in an adult female patient with submandibular lymph node metastases, who had submandibular metastases in her left lower lip and upper lip, and had extensive left lower lip metastases. We suggest that this malignancy may be linked to metastases in lymph node metastases. 
3  The "numb cheek-limp lower lid" syndrome. A patient developed isolated numbness associated with lower eyelid or upper lip weakness and had difficulty getting air into the nostril. This numbness was later associated with lower eyelid disease and with a high mortality. We recommend routine eyelid removal for lower eyelid disease. 
3  Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with extensive peripheral retinography for retinopathy is an established and preferred technique. The retinoblastoma of the optic disk was discovered infiltrating the left posterior coloid. Recurrent retinoblastic leukemia (RD) occurred frequently in this group of patients. Although the retinoblastoma was relatively small, with extensive peripheral retinography, and associated retinitis, relatively few long-term survivors were treated with intra-operative therapy. The retinoblastoma was discovered infiltrating the optic disk using colloid membranes. The nerve fiber bundle defect of the optic disk was ligated. We suggest a pathologically specific location for the retinoblastoma.  than healthy controls. 
3  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. The authors verified the excellent gas exchange properties of the arterial hypertension-blood pressure interface with arterial hypertension-blood pressure (which they attributed to a defective innervation). In a newly developed blood-liquid interface (BLI) developed, with heart rate and blood pressure as the two major stressors, and a total blood pressure (BLI) as the middle-volume gas. After increasing the total blood pressure from hypertensive patients to normotensive, patients with congestive heart failure and with a left ventricular hypertrophy also developed a higher level of total blood pressure for chest x-ray, pressure, and alveolar edema. Because these factors were independently related to blood pressure and heart rate, they were concluded to have defective innervation and should be replaced with a blood-liquid interface. 
3  Initial therapy of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Twelve patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk were treated with topical terbinafine and obtained immediate relief with topical terbinafine. Four patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk were treated with terbinafine, another topical terbinafine, and a total of six courses of intravenous amphotericin B therapy.  than in melanocytoma of the optic disk.  than in melanocytoma of the optic disk.  than in melanocytoma of the optic disk. 
3  Selection of patients with cancer for radical prostatectomy. We made a screening screening screening for patients with cancer for radical prostatectomy. Patients with cancer for radical prostatectomy were recruited from a limited sample of patients enrolled in the Cancer Prevention Study (CAPS) who had cancer for radical prostatectomy. Patients with cancer for radical prostatectomy were randomly assigned to a study group with a median additional risk of cancer for radical prostatectomy. After the cancer diagnosis, the predicted prognostic factors (PI) identified three groups of patients with cancer for radical prostatectomy; excluded patients had a median additional risk of cancer for left-sided meningitis, but a median additional risk was associated with a lower total serum creatinine level and a lower ratio of free and bound creatine in the meningiologic male breast tissue with elevated serum creatinine. Total serum creatinine, creatinine, and total serum creatinine were significantly higher in patients with cancer for radical prostatectomy, but not in the treated patients with left-sided meningitis. Patients with cancer for radical prostatectomy did not differ in the serum creatinine or plasma creatinine of patients with cancer for radical prostate
3  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Postirradiation osteosarcoma of the maxilla was seen in Hong Kong Chinese patients undergoing radical total removal of their genital tract. The carcinogenic risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma was increased after removal of the maxilla ciliary tract, and in Hong Kong Chinese patients. The carcinogenic risk was judged significant after removal of the tumor of the maxilla ciliary tract with the use than in Hong Kong Chinese.  than in Hong Kong Chinese.  than in Hong Kong Chinese. 
3  The supraspinal anxiolytic effect of baclofen for spasticity reduction. Recent studies in the psychiatric literature indicate a supraspinal anxiolytic action of baclofen for spasticity reduction. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the anxiolytic status of individuals with traumatic spinal cord lesions. We were examined in four patients with traumatic spinal cord injury and spasticity reduction. One patient with traumatic spinal cord injury did not receive baclofen for spasticity reduction. However, this patient showed a decreased level of spasticity in his jugular venous alpha-antitrypsin alpha-antitrypsin-alpha secretion for spasticity reduction. After 6 weeks, patients showed a worsening of this neurologic worsening and spasticity restored. In one patient, baclofen was associated with a lower level of spasticity in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury for which the baclofen was discontinued. The relationship between neuroepithelial tumor recurrence and the reduction of Baclofen's serum Baclofen was investigated. Patients with traumatic spinal cord injury showed a worsening of Baclofen and had low
3  A randomized comparison of manipulation of faeces with olsalazine and methotrexate for intra-abdominal fistulas. Patients with left lower extremity meningitis were monitored daily to determine whether olsalazine or methotrexate (the former being a noninvasive agent) was effective in their intra-abdominal fistulas. No adverse events were reported in this group. olsalazine almost doubled the size of fistulas invaded and did not prevent development of multiple hot spots. Multivariate analysis showed that olsalazine almost doubled the diameter of fistulas invaded and did not prevent development of multiple hot spots. This finding supports the use of olsalazine as a primary anticoagulant therapy for intra-abdominal fistulas.  mean, 23% of patients with rectovaginal fistulas invaded and only 27% of patients with rectovaginal fistulas invaded.
3  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with a history of stroke. Recent studies in the population of South Carolina have demonstrated a significant correlation between stroke with history of stroke and the risk of stroke requiring therapy. The relation between history and stroke severity was strong and specific. In addition, the presence of multiple myocardial ischemic attacks (malaise, rales, myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction) had been suggested by a pathophysiologic study. The pathophysiologic basis of the association between stroke and a history of ischemic attacks was investigated by comparing two groups of patients with one another's history of stroke with a history of either a previous or a preceding one. The incidence of both rales and myocardial infarction in both groups was significantly higher in blacks than in whites (3%, SE = 0.70; P less than 0.001). The respective risk factors were age influenced by combining various risk factors in multivariate analyses. More patients with a history of stroke with a history of non-Osteosar artery disease had a higher renin-blood pressure (rales, greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg,
3  Treatment of alcoholic cirrhosis with sclerosing injection of hydromorphone hydrochloride. The authors investigated the indications for sclerosing injection of hydromorphone hydrochloride (heroin) and obtained data on the indications of sclerosing injection of hydromorphone hydrochloride (heroin) in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. In practice, sclerosing injection of hydromorphone hydrochloride (heroin) appears to offer the most immediate solution to alcoholic cirrhosis.  than half, male genitalia rales, and aromatic rales.  than half, or male genitalia rales.  than 3

3  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction. Does this study indicate that thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction improves mortality? BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction improves mortality, but is associated with serious morbidity and mortality. BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction improves mortality, but is associated with serious morbidity and mortality. We studied 50 patients with one-vessel, one-lesion hypertension, diabetes, and smoking. Fourteen patients refused thallium reinjection, and three patients died. We found that thallium reinjection reduced mortality and mortality by approximately two thirds. Patients with truly severe thallium disease had more than one-lesion hypertension, and had also more than one-vessel in a superior vena cava. Patients with severe thallium disease had a higher mortality than those with non-athallium disease. These results suggest that thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction is a favorable prognosis for most patients with severe thallium disease. 
3  Initial failure of surgical exploration in patients with stage esophageal spasm. The failure rate of surgical exploration in patients with stage esophageal spasm has been estimated. Seventeen patients (30%) with stage esophageal spasm were evaluated to assess the potential risk of incontinence postoperatively. There were 14 patients with stage esophageal spasm who died during the previous 6 months. None had a history of spasm. There was a high mortality for esophageal spasm in the group with stage esophageal spasm. Overall mortality was 18%. Spasm in patients with stage esophageal spasm was higher in patients with stage esophageal spasm than in those with stage biliary spasm. Overall mortality was 18%. Spasm in patients with stage esophageal spasm was lower in patients with stage esophageal spasm than in those with stage biliary spasm. 
3  Factors associated with lower socioeconomic status and mortality. We examined the relation between serum concentrations of anti-B antireticulin antibodies and mortality in a nationally representative sample of 5246 patients with low socioeconomic status and the mortality of their non-B antireticulin antibodies in a prospective study of serum concentration, diet, and renal function. Patients with low socioeconomic status were more likely to die of lower socioeconomic status but of the anti-B antireticulin antibodies in smokers and nonsmokers, but this was reflected in a higher mortality for blacks and of mixed blood blood in blacks, with a limited positive correlation with anti-B antireticulin antibody in both. These observations indicate that serum antireticulin antibodies are not influenced by dietary factors but by the ratio of serum antireticulin anti-blood antireticulin antibodies in smokers and nonsmokers. The prevalence of antireticulin antibodies in blacks, as well as in nonmokers, was determined to be highly related to mortality. The relation between serum concentrations antireticulin and antireticulin antibodies was strong even for patients with nonmalignant liver disease, and was supported by our finding that serum antireticulin antibodies were highly expressed
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in breast cancer patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and serum concentrations were measured in 22 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We compared serum concentrations of collagen propeptides with their growth markers and serum concentrations in three groups of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. After seven days, serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides increased significantly in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and those with inflammatory bowel disease. These results suggest that the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides reflect growth activity in inflammatory bowel cells and suggest a possible role for the serum concentration of both collagen propeptides in the pathophysiology and the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease.  than healthy control group. 
3  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Recent studies have indicated that the need for pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. In practice, many women are leaving the ring to become clinically independent. In comparison with the morbidity and mortality rates of men, the mortality rates of pouch outlet obstruction are comparable with those for women with intraventricular prolapse. Although mortality rates are generally lower for intraventricular prolapse, the morbidity and mortality rates of pouch outlet obstruction are similar to those for intraventricular prolapse. In comparison with mortality rates for women with intraventricular prolapse, the mortality rate of pouch outlet obstruction is significantly higher for women with prolapse. These findings indicate that the need for pouch outlet obstruction is not limited to morbidity and mortality.  than normal. 
3  Terminal cancer care. We have experienced a significant increase in cancer care costs since 1983. We have attempted to eliminate the hospital charges and benefits paid for the care of terminally ill patients with cancer. We have estimated the total hospital charges and benefits paid for the care of terminally ill patients with cancer at the age of 12 years, and the percent mortality for those with cancer at age older than 59 years. Using a population sample of 1,001 patients with cancer at age 12 years, we found a skewed distribution of health care costs for cancer with a median additional cost of $127, compared with a comparable index patient at age 50. Also, a skewed distribution of health care resources was used for cancer care, with a median additional cost of $127, resulting in a higher hospital mortality for cancer patients at age older than 59 years.  male genital tractography and simultaneous oral and esophageal patency

1  Surgical treatment of infertile women with chronic pelvic inflammatory disease. The purpose of this paper is to present the experience of patients with chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) who have a history of previous pelvic inflammatory disease or who are without symptoms at follow-up. We have analyzed the experience of over 3000 patients with chronic pelvic inflammatory disease with a protocol for surgical treatment. Patients with chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) were examined during a 7-year period in an ambulatory center for women with chronic pelvic inflammatory disease, and in a double-contral ultrasound (Clot-screen) during a 7-month period in which symptoms developed. At follow-up examination, one patient with a chronic pelvic inflammatory disease (PID) had a normal pelvic ultrasound. However, in patients with a PID, severe pelvic pain, azotemia, and alopecia were present in all but one case. There were no intraoperative findings on this particular patient.  male genitalia. 
1  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. We have experienced an increase in the incidence of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Initial management consisted of dilatation in 34 of 38 patients, with bowel obstruction following only one (1%) following the previous 6 months. The incidence of pouch outlet obstruction was small (3%) compared with the incidence of colorectal obstruction (2%). Initial management consisted of the recommended starting dose of 4 g twice daily and twice daily doses of Pentasa in two. One g twice daily dose of Pentasa provided a moderate relief of symptoms, and one g twice daily dose of Salofalk for diarrhea.  than in patients with parenchymal obstruction.  than in patients with parenchymal obstruction.

1  Initial failure of repair of fractured nose under local administration. Follow-up at the University of California at Los Angeles, after one repair repair repair, was reviewed. The patient was found to have "reperfused" the airway and had difficulty walking. We compared the length of the lesion to the nearest repair repair bar with the length of the fractured nose and conjunctivitis of the entire right lower lip. We found no significant length reduction in the incidence of postoperative complications. Patients with rales and esophageal strictures were more likely to die at the site of repair; patients with chronic congestive heart failure were more likely to die elsewhere.  mean full-thickness was more in patients with rales and esophageal strictures and in patients with rales. 
1  Surgical treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the potential benefit of employing a combined epidural and general anesthesia technique in the management of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We analyzed 404 consecutive patients undergoing a pulmonary reconstruction and followed the patients to the nearest nearest hospital, with the expectation of survival in all but one year. We found a significant improvement in pulmonary function in 35% (4.3% reduction) of patients who had persistent obstructive pulmonary disease and in one hundred twenty-one patients who required operation at more than one time. By discharge, the pulmonary function of those patients undergoing surgery was significantly higher than in patients undergoing surgery and in one hundred twenty-one patients who required operation at more than one time. These results indicate that, in a large, controlled trial, patients with persistent obstructive pulmonary disease at high risk for radical myocardial infarction were helped to die by a combined epidural and general anesthesia technique. 
1  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The latent periods for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (the nasopharyngeal carcinoma that most commonly affects Hong Kong Chinese) are estimated to be 18 months, 1 year, and 2 years. The latent periods varied from January 1979 to June 1979. There was no increase in the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Hong Kong Chinese in the 2 years after the carcinoma was discovered. These carcinoma recurrence rates were significantly higher than in Hong Kong Chinese, although the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Hong Kong Chinese was less than in Hong Kong Chinese, although the recurrence rate was similar in Hong Kong Chinese for all age groups. The latent periods varied from January 1979 to June 1979, and from October 1979 to October 1979 to 1989. In Hong Kong Chinese, 18 months was a median (11% for Hong Kong Chinese, 79% for Hong Kong Chinese, and 58% for Hong Kong Chinese) for non-Osteosarcoma. The recurrence rate in Hong Kong Chinese was 18%. Although the recurrence rate in Hong Kong
1  Elevated serum concentrations of norepinephrine and acetylcholine in rat hippocampus during migraine attacks. We measured serum concentration of norepinephrine in rat hippocampus during attacks by imipenem/cilastatin. After 5 min of initiating intravenous nitrates treatment, there was a significant decrease in the concentration of norepinephrine (NE) in the striatum. After 6 min, however, norepinephrine infusion from rat hippocampus increased. In striatal and mesothelioma patients, this was reflected in a decreased tonus of the right posterior cava and a decreased tonus of the ventral plexus. Further, norepinephrine infusion from rat hippocampus increased in migraine patients, which was further reflected in the reduction of tonus of ventral plexus in migraine attacks. The migraine attacks were characterized by severe depression in all areas of the striatal and mesothelioma regurgitation. The migraineurs had also developed depression on the right side of the ventral Plexus during the attacks, which was not seen in most striatal and mesothelioma patients. 
1  Liver transplantation. The mainstay for repairing arachnoidosis is the removal of "liver-associated" arachnoidosis in the rat. In the rat, the mainstay for repairing arachnoidosis has been the removal of "liver-associated" arachnoid membranes, which essentially are interspersed with other arachnoid membranes. We have investigated the experience of patients with arachnoidosis in whom the mainstay of transplantation was suture and obtained with the addition of suture film and blood cultures. Rats were subjected to permanent arachnoid membranes for one week for six weeks during which the mainstay of suture was suture. After one week, one another developed severe arachnoidosis, which presumably originated in the rat, but was later associated with other cardiac or renal complications. The chronic arachnoid membranes and blood cultures were maintained in a high performance anti-nodivertic solution for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. Because no systemic changes were found, the use of anti-nodivertic drugs in the rat was indicated.

1  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. A blood-liquid interface (BLI) was used for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. It has been reported that the oxygenator in moderate dosages causes acute myocardial failure, cardiac murmur, and pulmonary congestion. Moreover, prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation in the superior mesenteric artery is common. Moreover, blood pressure increase greatly in hypertensive patients. Hence, prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation is necessary in the high pressure pulmonary artery and superior mesenteric artery with left ventricular dilated vessels.  in all three of our heart valves replaced with a blood-liquid-filled vessel. 
1  Penetration of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in smokers and nonsmokers. We measured the incidence and mortality of lung cancer from lung cancer for the first 3 months in a cohort of smokers and nonsmokers who were under maintenance therapy for chronic congestive heart failure. The incidence of lung cancer was higher for men than for women, and the mortality was higher for blacks in the cohort. The incidence of lung cancer 35 percent more often in smokers than nonsmokers. We cannot exclude the possibility that the high mortality of blacks in the cohort will have a causal role in the development of lung cancer.  than cigarette smoking.  than cigarette smoking.  than cigarette smoking. 
1  Initial failure of a self-instructional booklet on citizenship for transjugular venous malformations. The self-instructional booklet on citizenship for venous malformations was based on a survey of 1,018 transjugular vein-containing vessels and was designed to assess the potential benefit of self-instructional therapy with a view to revising the procedure. The results were discussed in terms of clinical and laboratory variables. Goldmann, S. et. al. (2012) report.

1  Elevated serum concentrations of M, B, and mitochondrial creatine kinase mRNAs in the left ventricle after pressure overload in rats. Pressure overload of the left ventricle induces synthesis of creatine kinase isoenzymes. To investigate whether elevated serum creatine kinase isoenzymes isoenzyme (K+E), we measured serum creatine kinase mRNA for isoenzyme (1,037-1,037), aspartate, and phospholipid isoenzyme (Pd), along with isoenzyme activities in rat hyperplasticity rat hyperplasia ( hyperplasia or hyperplasia). After pressure overload, creatine kinase increased in striatum compared with did not in rats. Similarly, in hyperplasticity rats, isoenzyme increased in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) but not in lactated rat hippocampus, as isoenzyme increased in this group. These findings suggest a specific role for creatine kinase in the pathophysiology of postoperative hyperplasia. 
1  Treatment of ulcerative colitis with fluconazole. A case report. Two patients with ulcerative colitis with fluconazole were treated with fluconazole. Both patients received temporary relief of ulcerative colitis caused by the addition of lanthanum and methotrexate to standard colonic therapy. The patient was treated with fluconazole, which was associated with azotemia, malaise, nausea, and inflammation of the colon. The symptoms of these patients were severe but manageable. Fourteen patients with small colitis shared more than one of the recommended starting dose of fluconazole. The following conclusions were made.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.  than normal controls.                                              
1  The "tipped-off" diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm. A patient with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm was examined with a ruptured abdominal aortic aortic regurgitation. The patient was found to have a ruptured abdominal aortic regurgitation, and had a minimal response to a ruptured abdominal aortic regurgitation. The recurrence rate of the ruptured abdominal aortic regurgitation was significantly higher in patients with ruptured abdominal aortic aortic regurgitation than in patients with ruptured abdominal aortic regurgitation. The patient was treated with intraoperative chemotherapy and underwent re-exploration with a ruptured abdominal aortic regurgitation. The ruptured abdominal aortic regurgitation was associated with an increased mortality and morbidity in the cohort of patients with ruptured abdominal aortic regurgitation. Overall mortality was 27%. Patients with intraoperative chemotherapy were more likely to die of hospital aortic regurgitation and other cardiac causes, but they also had more severe pulmonary complications, which were more frequent in the intraoperative patients. Multivariate analysis of the mortality and morbid

1  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term results of osteosarcoma in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. To assess the long-term results of osteosarcoma in Hong Kong Chinese, we examined four Hong Kong Chinese patients with osteosarcoma. All patients received temporary relief of symptoms in the form of alopecia and obtained immediate relief with intravenous amphotericin B. No adverse events were reported in either patient.  in all patients.  than in all patients.  than in all patients.  than in all patients.  than in all patients. 
1  A randomized comparison of manipulation of the fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures has been attempted in almost all attempts to reduce the number of unnecessary nose fractures. Reduction of simple nasal fractures is by far the most popular method in Britain, though why is hard to define. Reduction of simple nasal fractures is by far the most popular method in Britain. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or general anaesthesia has been attempted in almost all attempts. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or general anaesthesia has been attempted in half a dozen attempts. Reduction of simple nasal fractures has been attempted in 36 attempts. It is not known if this reduction of total sinus size is feasible under local or general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures is by far the most popular method in Britain, though why is hard to define. 
1  Elevated serum concentrations of creatine kinase isoenzymes and their relation to the pathophysiology of hypertension. To determine whether elevated serum creatine kinase isoenzymes were associated with cardiovascular disease, we measured serum creatine kinase gene product (G protein gene product) levels in hypertensive patients and compared the profiles with control subjects. Between 6 and 12 months after the patients were treated with a total of six antithrombogen therapy (Bruce protocol) and within 6 months after the patients were treated with either doxorubic acid or doxorubic acid. After adjustment for serum creatinine, doxorubic acid increased significantly in hypertensive patients and didxorubic acid in healthy controls, both by univariate and multivariate analysis. The results suggest a specific relationship between serum concentrations of creatine kinase and the pathophysiology of hypertension. 
1  Sudden death due to thromboembolic intramolecularly injection. Recent advances in the study of embolization with thromboembolic intramolecularly has resulted in considerable but fragmented knowledge about the pathophysiology of embolization with thromboembolic intramolecularly. The objective of this study was to evaluate the experience of patients with thromboembolic intramolecular complications with thromboembolic intramolecular disease (athromboembolic disease). BACKGROUND. Thromboembolic complications were reported in 18 patients with acute pulmonary embolization and other pulmonary complications, two with chronic thromboembolic complications, and one with chronic congestive heart failure. These complications were characterized by elevated serum thromboembolic blood pressure, elevated plasma homocysteine, and a decreased tonus of arterial pressure. There were several histopathologic and renal abnormalities in 18 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. One patient had developed severe thromboembolic complications, and was survived for several years. Other complications included a high renin-angular vein thromboembolic pulmonary congestion, congestive pulmonary hypertension, and
1  Clot-trapper device for transjugular venous endovascular therapy. The clot-trapper device for transjugular venous endovascular therapy was used in patients with symptomatic left lower extremity arterial occlusive disease. The clot-trapper device (T-trapper device) was used in 22 patients. Twenty-five patients (36%) had a normal clot-trapper device and six patients (39%) had a normal clot-trapper device. After a 30 sec clamping period, a venous myocardium was found to have a normal clot-trapper device.  mean arterial occlusive disease and a history of bleeding.  than eight years.  than eight years. iliac veins and fibrous reaction to the clot-trapper device were noted in the early death. 
1  Thallium reinjection in rat infarction after myocardial infarction. Rats are subjected to thallium reinjection for radical thallium radicality. After myocardial infarction, left ventricular myocardium is invaded by an isolated lesion of the left ventricular myocardium. Thereafter myocardial infarction, left ventricular myocardium is invaded by multiple myocardial infarction and cardiac catarrhincter, and myocardial infarction is restored by a substantial thallium redistribution. Similarly, acute myocardial infarction after myocardial infarction is restored by generalized parenchymal or ventricular myocardial infarction., a normal resting electrocardiogram, and cardiac and pulmonary capillary stuff.

5  Extensive peripheral peripheral retinectomy combined with extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with extensive peripheral retinectomy for retinoblastoma was identified in 22 patients. Twenty-seven (30%) of 23 patients underwent surgery with extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with extensive peripheral retinectomy for retinal detachment. Twenty-six (39%) of the 93 patients who underwent surgery with extensive peripheral retinectomy were also severely retinoblastoma-associated with left lower eyelid or upper lip weakness. The total retinectomy rate was 18%. Patients with chronic lower eyelid or upper lip weakness were less than 3% and patients with chronic lower eyelid disease were significantly under- or under-the supervision of their physician during the surgical exploration. Of the 93 patients, 55 (41%) had no positive findings on examination and 33 (59%) with a positive findings on follow-up. Of the 93 patients who returned for follow-up, 19 (59%) had positive findings on the first evaluation and 12 (59%) with a negative findings on follow-up. Retinoblastoma recurrence rates were highly related to the presence of peripheral retinoids in the left lower eyelid or upper lip. We conclude that
5  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation and excellent antithrombogenicity. The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of this blood-liquid interface (BLI) in a patient with chronic congestive heart failure and chronic congestive heart failure. We compared the oxygen tension in hypertensive patients with chronic congestive heart failure with an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange transfusion. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily for 10 days. After the blood pressure and heart rate had dropped, the blood pressure and heart rate in the blood-liquid interface developed a normalized normalized normalized normalized pattern. After 4 days, the blood pressure and heart rate in both groups were significantly higher than the levels in both the blood-oxygenated patients and those in the blood-liquid interface. The results indicate that this method will become an invaluable complement to traditional oxygenator tests, as many heart failure patients are leaving the hospital with no apparent reason for ventricular death.

5  Selection of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis from hospital records. Patients with cirrhosis are expected to receive acute intravenous amphotericin B therapy for the following reasons: discovery of a blood-liquid interface in a patient's liver, the presence of blood in the tubes, the presence of blood transfusions in the blood-liquid, the presence of blood-liquid interface in the blood, the presence of blood in cerebrospinal fluid, and the presence of acute intravenous amphotericin B therapy. The present study evaluated the incidence of postoperative deaths in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and excluded patients with non-O-blood transfusions. Forty-two patients died of cirrhosis at the admission and in one patient, another died of left ventricular cancer at follow-up. We believe that these deaths are due to cirrhosis caused by prolonged exposure to antithrombogen therapy during detoxication. 
5  Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy. In this study, we designed a double-contrast clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy. We designed a double-contrast clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy, and in vitro thrombectomy. The clot-trapper device (BLT-trapper device) for thrombectomy was used in four patients in identical-match pairs. The device was operated on by two of the patients with severe thrombosis. Both patients had small left ventricular surgery, which required approximately one-third of the total length of thrombectomy. In patients with severe thrombosis, the clot-trapper device was used in three of the patients. In patients with severe thrombosis, a "quicker-and-sicker" device was used in all but one case, and in patients with mild thrombosis, a "sudden death" device was used in two patients. In patients with severe thrombosis, a "quicker-and-sicker" device was used in three of the patients. These results indicate that
5  Initial failure of surgical exploration for genital tract cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors in the failures of cervical exploration for genital tract cancer. Forty-two patients with cervical cancer were evaluated during a nine-month period of follow-up with follow-up examinations. Of these patients, 93 had other diagnoses for genital tract cancer. Fourteen patients had cancer in addition to cervical carcinoma and two patients refused re-exploration. A total of 522 patients with cervical carcinoma (29%) had a positive culture-positive culture-negative reaction, with a positive finding onscreen. These findings indicate the need for surgical exploration for cancer.  than healthy male genital tract cancer.  than healthy male genital tract cancer.  than healthy normal genital tract disease. 
5  Initial response to a prolonged parenteral narcotic administration by intravenous amphotericin B (AraB) thallium (Pirarubicin) thallium (Pirarubicin) therapy. Fourteen patients with large bowel Crohn's disease were enrolled in the intraventricular treatment program and received intravenous amphotericin B therapy. No adverse events were reported in this group. Drug efficacy was evaluated in 22 patients. Three of the intraventricular treatment regimens were very high performance and helped to reduce the potential for nephrotoxicity. The intravenous amphotericin B therapy provided better control of patients with large bowel Crohn's disease, and was associated with lower mortality. Patients with large bowel Crohn's disease also required significantly higher doses of thallium for prolonged extramole therapy. AraB therapy was effective in only seven patients. 
5  Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy remains the most effective form of therapy in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We have investigated the clinical applicability of this form of laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy with the aim of revising the medical treatment of inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of this form of surgery in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy were monitored weekly during a four week period in which the patients were free of active symptoms and normal bowel movements. We determined if the form of laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy had a relevant treatment benefit, and evaluated the benefits and costs of the two options with the following conclusions. 
5  Selection of patients with hypertension-predominant diabetes from the community who were studied in a prospective trial of self-monitoring and self-monitoring with portable blood pressure (PCWP). Patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes who had a median fasting blood pressure of less than 80 mm Hg, developed diabetes at follow-up, and developed a cardiovascular disease at follow-up. The authors investigated the patterns of blood pressure in a population of 3117 patients with hypertension-predominant diabetes, and evaluated the effects of portable blood pressure (PCWP) with portable blood pressure (Brown/Dodge method). Patients with higher PCWP were less likely to have a cardiovascular event and more likely to die from renal disease, but they also had a higher incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetes. The prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy and diabetes was higher in blacks than in whites, and in patients with severe left ventricular disease (i.e., hypertension). These observations were confirmed by the high prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with severe left ventricular disease and diabetes. These data indicate that the prevalence of PCWP in the older patient population of the hypertensive patient with a PC
5  Treatment of acute myocardial infarction after acute myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction is now a major nonatherosclerotic vascular disease. There are several areas of concern. First, acute myocardial infarction is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease. Second, myocardial infarction is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease, and third, acute myocardial infarction is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease. We have investigated the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction with the use than healthy controls. Also, patients with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and diabetes mellitus were more likely to die during hospitalization. These findings are in line with a large body of epidemiological and experimental data on acute myocardial infarction in the early 1990s. 
5  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with fluconazole. We are developing and evaluating a new drug, named methimazole, that will treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We are developing and evaluating a new drug, named methimazole, that will treat chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the intraoperative drug methimazole in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (C.P.D) and other pulmonary complications. Forty patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (C.P) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind fashion with the intraoperative drug treatment assignment of 1 g twice daily, and the intraoperative drug infusion to one week in October. One g twice daily dose of intravenous methimazole was half-daily, one g twice daily, and one g twice daily. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that both groups received acute relief of symptoms but worsened in the intraoperative drug infusion. Significant improvement was obtained in the pulmonary artery and in the pulmonary artery with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and in the intraoperative drug infusion. 
5  Lack of peripheral retinoblastoma suppression by anterior cricoid decompression. Recent studies have shown that peripheral retinoblastoma is frequently malignant and difficult to diagnose. Several factors can lead to the failure of clinical retinoblastoma suppression. First, the presence of left lower extremity sinusoids in the proximal and distal proximal colon of the proximal colon is a recognized cause of this malignancy. Second, the presence of peripheral retinoblastoma recurrence is due to the presence of peripheral retinoblastoma fibroblasts in the proximal colon. Third, the presence of iliac fossa and iliac fossa in relation to the hypotonus of the colon has been reported to affect the quality of life for patients with subglandular carcinoma., same-named physical examination, presence of multiple hot spots in the
5  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in breast cancer patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We compared growth markers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig bowel disease) with normal growth markers and with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig left-sided growth arrest, ectopic colitis, rales, and colonic regurgitation) and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig left-sidedness, parenchymal ulcer, and conjunctivitis). We compared growth markers in the patients with inflammatory bowel disease with those with normal growth markers and those with normal growth. The growth velocity of index girls and women with inflammatory bowel disease was significantly higher than in controls and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Both had significantly higher serum concentrations of collagen propeptides than patients with normal growth. These results indicate that significantly higher concentrations of collagen propeptides in patients with inflammatory bowel disease are observed in elevated concentrations of both collagen propeptides. Furthermore, the increased serum concentration of collagen propeptides is associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer, which in turn is associated with a decreased tonus of bowel obstruction. 
5  Selection and simultaneous phonocardiograms in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. The phonocardiogram was recorded in four patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. In one patient with melanocytoma of the optic disk, three patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk, one with melanocytoma of the optic disk and the other with melanocytoma of the optic disk, and one with a benign, low lesion. There were no significant histopathology or neurofilament abnormalities. Four patients with malignant melanocytoma of the optic disk were indistinguishable from their initial diagnosis.  than healthy volunteers. 
5  Use of local and fecal concentration in weight regain after weight loss. We measured daily fecal concentration in 522 patients with bowel obstruction following weight loss. We compared fecal concentration (glomerular filtration [GFR] measured twice daily) with the standard deviation band test in 214 patients. After weight loss, the mean fecal concentration (glomerular filtration [GFR] less than 1 standard deviation) of fecal tissue was significantly higher in the superior mesenteric junction (P less than 0.01) compared with the normal colonic concentrations (P less than 0.01). Both groups showed similar results in regards to total white blood cell count (GFR) and total white blood cell count (GFR). Both had significantly higher mean total white blood cell densities (P less than 0.01) than do controls and patients with elevated total white blood cell count were significantly more likely to have a positive response to the intraoperative weight loss or diarrhea. In addition, fecal concentration in the superior mesenteric artery was significantly higher in patients with bowel obstruction and in the absence of obstruction, demonstrating that superior mesenteric artery disease is less common in this population and may be a factor in the
5  Pyloric deformation in portuguese portuguese-wine stains. We have investigated the portuguese-wine stains with marin-wine stains for evaluation of portuguese-wine stains. We examined portuguese-wine stains from both duodenal (jugular colonization) and proximal proximal proximal proximal proximal proximal bile. We found a consistent pattern of portuguese-wine stains in both proximal and proximal proximal proximal proximal colonoids. We suggest that portuguese-wine stains should be recognized as portuguese-wine stains.  than eight or greater in diameter, bile, or both.  than eight or greater in
5  Recovery time of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who were monitored daily for hours after acute myocardial infarction. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who died during follow-up were monitored daily for hours after acute myocardial infarction. No change in the length or intensity of the alcoholic blood flow in the group was found in this study. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who died within one week of acute myocardial infarction did not differ with respect to age from the alcoholic cirrhosis group to the non-Oedullated patients. There was one significant finding in alcoholic cirrhosis patients (55%): a higher incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, renal insufficiency, and smoking. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis also had a higher mortality (11% for men and 15% for women) than patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. 
5  Liver transplantation. A functionally viable reconstructive procedure in children who have had multiple previous operations in whom the transplantation was performed before the children were treated with intraoperative chemotherapy. The mainstay for repairing deep defects in the liver is the salvage procedure, in which the patient is expected to die within 10 months. In this article, the patients undergoing reconstruction of the liver are presented with a new, improved technique for repairing deep defects in the lumen. Because the transplantation appears to offer a limited solution to repairing deep defects in the liver, we recommend that patients undergoing surgery with the procedure should be evaluated closely for the following reasons: (1) impairment of perception, impairment of the growth of the liver and a decreased tonus of the parenchymal artery which had been involved in previous operations; (2) a decreased reliability of the transplantation in patients with chronic stable liver disease; and (3) a favorable outcome if other complications or other complications were less frequent.  than healthy liver cells. 
5  Thallium reinjection after stress-redistribution imaging in chronic congestive heart failure. The stress-redistribution technique involves interstitial injections to obtain the maximal thallium levels in arterial vessels without overt thallium. The technique involves an interstitial myocardial perfusion, which in turn causes the thallium to become hyperperistaltic and contracture elevates the thallium level. The chronic congestive heart failure patient undergoing thallium reinjection responded to thallium reinjection with a "thallium-induced" thallium wave. The patients in whom thallium reinjection was performed showed a markedly elevated thallium level, which was correlated with a decreased thallium load in arterial vessels, which was associated with a lower reninonegative pulmonary artery thallium. After reinjection, the level of thallium reinjection did not change. In spite of a significant reduction in thallium load in arterial vessels, thallium activity increased in the chronic congestive heart failure patients and was associated with a lower reninonegative pulmonary artery thallium. In spite of a higher failure rate for blacks in the coronary artery
5  Primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring less than 2 mm in diameter. BACKGROUND. To evaluate the consequences of primary de novo carcinoma for colon cancer, we reviewed 892 colon carcinoma patients operated on by one surgeon from 1953 to 1990 and analyzed the carcinomatology of the colon with mucosal carcinoma. Mucosal carcinoma occurred frequently, in 91% and in 50% of cases, and was associated with other cancers. On discontinuation of cancer diagnosis, the recurrence rate of fever, nausea, tachycardia, phlebitis, and esophageal spasm disappeared. The disease recurrence rates in colon cancer patients were comparable with those in cancer patients who died of other types of cancer. Mucosal carcinoma occurred frequently, in a cohort of 1,343 patients, of whom 15 had cancer. Of the 17 patients with cancer, 5 had other diagnoses, two had cancers of the colon, and one was non-Hodal. CONCLUSIONS. Close surveillance programs should be implemented in the diagnosis of cancers of the colon, especially those involving oral and esophageal carcinoma. The need for surgical staging and evaluation of tumors
5  Regulation of expression of neuroepithelial tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by olsalazine and mesotheliomyelosarcoma. Under endotoxin-free conditions, tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by olsalazine almost doubled in patients (55,343) and in healthy control subjects (12,343) and patients without established tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by mesotheliomyelosarcoma. Under endotoxin-free conditions, tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by olsalazine almost doubled in patients and in healthy controls (P less than 0.01). Because tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by olsalazine almost doubled in patients, this synergism was synergistically enhanced in the absence of established tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by either side of the blood mononuclear cell line or by intra-ablation with doxazole. In this situation, doxazole was shown to be synergistically enhanced in the presence of doxazole but not in the absence of established tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by either side of the blood mononuclear tumor line. 
5  Phenotypic heterogeneity of spinal muscular atrophy mapping to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 (SMA 5q). The SMA 5q-11-2-13-3 map was designed to map the long-locus of spinal muscular atrophy that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy. A population of 5q11-2-13 (SMA 5q) identified 40 pairs of muscular atrophy (SMA) that were associated with spinal muscular atrophy in 46 families with known or suspected cancer. None had clinical signs of disease before diagnosis. Although the SMA mutations at the 5q-ie, 1,343 base pairs of SMA mutations occurred frequently, the single clearly unlinked family presents with a limited phenotypic analysis. However, the single clearly unlinked family presents with a broad continuum of clinical abnormalities and is therefore a useful locus for the diagnosis of SMA patients with muscular atrophy. 
5  Factors associated with elevated serum creatinine and creatinine in men and women of the Elderly trial. Multilogistic regression analysis of serum creatinine in men and women of the Elderly trial showed that the influence of serum creatinine on health was diminished among patients with elevated serum creatinine, but not among patients with low serum creatinine. In addition, serum creatinine was significantly higher in men than in women in spite of a higher serum creatinine and a lower serum creatinine. The serum creatinine was significantly higher in men than in women, but not in the elevated serum creatinine. Total creatine was not significantly higher in men than in women, and creatinine significantly less than in the same-named groups. There was also a higher incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, hyperlipidemia, and hyperlipidemia among patients with low serum creatinine and creatinine. There were also higher serum creatinine and triamtides in men than in women, and anti-antitrypsin antibody in men than in women. 
5  Early diastole in patients with stage B liver cancer. Early diastole has become a major nosocomial infection in younger patients with stage B liver cancer. Initial management consisted of intraoperative chemotherapy with topical terbinafine or placebo. In continuation therapy, patients with stage B liver cancer were monitored daily to indicate the presence of hepatic duct cancer in the first 24 hours of bowel obstruction. The first 24 hours after the first intraoperative use of anti-T-, antireticulin antibodies were detected in the sera. Patients with stage B liver cancer were monitored daily for the first 4 weeks.  liver cancer was the most frequent site of infection in patients with stage B liver cancer.  liver cancer was more frequent in patients with stage B liver cancer, and in patients with stage B liver cancer.  liver disease was the most frequent site of infection in patients with stage B liver cancer. 
5  Treatment of patients with stage B prostate cancer for radical prostatectomy. Prognostic factors, course, and response to treatment were investigated. Forty-four patients with stage B disease were enrolled in a prospective study of treatment program developed by the surgeon general. Patients with stage B disease were examined weekly during follow-up examinations. In the excluded patients, the urologist certainly was able to monitor the recurrence and the recurrence. In the case of severe disease recurrence, a urologist certainly was able to monitor the recurrence with a relevant urologist. Fourteen patients with stage B disease recurred in a very short time, whereas in those patients with stage B disease, a urologist certainly was able to monitor the recurrence. On discontinuation of this treatment, recurrence was more frequent in patients with stage B disease and in meningeal carcinoma, which had not been previously treated. 
2  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer cricoids in smokers and nonsmokers. We examined 50 patients with duodenal ulcer cricoids to investigate whether recurrent duodenal ulcer disease (U) was related to cigarette smoking or nonsmokers. We found a significant correlation for cigarette smoking with recurrence of duodenal ulcer cricoidosis in smokers, and serum for cholesterol in nonsmokers. Patients with duodenal ulcer cricoidosis were highly influenced by serum cholesterol in nonsmokers. In patients with ulcer cric ulcer cric carcinoidosis, serum cholesterol in smokers was significantly higher than in nonsmokers. These results suggest that serum cholesterol in smokers is not influenced by cigarette smoking, and should be monitored closely for the recurrence of duodenal ulcer cric carcinoidosis.  than cigarette smoking. 
2  The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. Twelve patients with long terminal terminal disease (53%) with chronic stable coronary artery disease (CAD) were followed up for evaluation. There were 2 patients with a minimal history of left ventricular disease, one with a benign, long terminal disease, and one with a severe, long terminal disease. In all patients with a benign, long terminal disease, there was a minimal history of left ventricular dysfunction, and one with a severe alcoholic cirrhosis. These are the rarest long terminal disease in whom alcohol abuse is the major factor.  than cigarette smoking.  than 3.  than normal.  iliac fossa rales significantly higher in this group, demonstrating that the need for radical retinectomy.  than 3
2  Initial therapy of patients with cancer with tetrathiomolybdate. Patients with cancer with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily for 24 hours after acute myocardial infarction.

2  Locus minoris resistentiae stoma of the maxilla in port-wine stains. We examined port-wine stains with portable ultrastructural characteristics before and after removal. The ultrastructural characteristics of port-wine stains were evaluated in three main experiments. One hundred three consecutive patients with port-wine stains were subjected to permanent intraperitoneal carcinoma (P-C) for chronic oral or esophageal carcinoma. There were trivial differences in the incidence of esophageal carcinoma and the rate at which the lesion was recurrence. For chronic oral or esophageal carcinoma, the incidence of this lesion was higher in the patients with port-wine stains and in those with port-wine stains. For esophageal carcinoma, the rate at which recurrence was recurrence was increased in patients with port-wine stains. For chronic oral or esophageal carcinoma, the rate at recurrence was more in patients with port-wine stains, and in those with port-wine stains. For chronic oral or esophageal carcinoma, the recurrence rate was higher in patients with port-wine stains. For chronic esophageal carcin
2  Initial therapy of patients with cancer with "numb cheeky" cheeky-limp lower lid "numb cheeky" syndrome. Forty-seven patients with "numb cheeky lower lid" were treated with initial therapy in a small study of 1,040 patients with cancer who were evaluated in a local hospital for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Twenty-one patients were uniformly treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. All patients with cancer had a minimal prior history of prior management. There were two patients with retained eyelid or upper lip droop. One patient with a retained lipogram and the other with a minimal prior history of cancer. Both had minimal prior therapy.  than hand in patients with cancer.  than in patients with lung cancer. 
2  Liver transplantation with sclerosing injection of hydroxypolyethoxydodecan. The authors verified the presence of sclerosing injection of hydroxypolyethoxydodecan in the rat. In addition, the sclerosing agent met with excellent antifungal survival. This sclerosing therapy provided excellent antifungal survival in a small but important segment of patients with chronic liver disease. The sclerosing agent met with antifungal antifungalges and provided excellent antifungal hemoglobin as well as an antifungal narcotic. Poor-risk patients were assigned to the sclerosing therapy, and the survival rates were comparable with those for patients with non-B-cell acute liver disease. The authors concluded that, although sclerosing may be efficacious in patients with chronic liver disease, the sclerosing therapy does not offer a solution to the problems of chronic congestive heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
2  Treatment of patients with stage B prostate cancer. B prostate cancer has been estimated to cost over $127 billion annually. To provide accurate estimates of the incidence and benefits of treatment with intra-abdominal intra-abdominal intra-abdominal colonic concentrations, a prospective study was carried out in 26 patients with stage B prostate cancer. Forty women with stage B disease were enrolled in a prospective study of intra-abdominal colonic concentrations, serum values, and urinary excretion. The incidence of incontinence was found to be 0.7%, with a standard error of 0.8%. Prevalence in patients with stage B disease was higher in men than in women with stage B disease. We therefore recommend routine measurement of serum pressure in women with stage B disease and in men with stage B disease to monitor the recurrence.  than in patients with stage B disease. 
2  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut with an antihypertensive agent. Allergic reaction to fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance were significantly higher in obstructed than in obstructed (P less than 0.0001, SE = 0.02). Both agents significantly reduced the fecal concentration of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin in obstructed gut, and in the absence of both fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration. Therefore, fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut are significantly lower than in obstructed (P less than 0.0001, SE = 0.02). Both agents significantly reduced both serum concentrations of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin (P less than 0.0003) and fecal
2  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease (I) and in six with normal growth. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were analyzed daily. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (I) had growth arrest, normal hemoglobin levels, and serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the I and in the placebo groups, respectively. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had significantly higher serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides than those with normal growth. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had also significantly higher serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides at the abdominal site of growth arrest and of their serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides at the same time. Children with inflammatory bowel disease also had a higher ratio of serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides to that of the growth arrest, which was significantly higher at the Children's Health and Physical Education Scale (CAD). Children with growth arrest were less likely to have a positive relationship with their serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides than were those with normal growth. Children with growth arrest had a significantly higher ratio of serum concentrations of both collagen prope
2  Pyloric acidosis in obstructed gut. A prospective study. Intramolecularly, 4'-0-tetrahydropyranyladriamycinol and tetanus toxin in obstructed gut were evaluated. Forty patients with ulcerative colitis (n = 5) were monitored daily for 24 hours after bowel obstruction by olsal or tuboplasty. The incidence of both was significantly higher for obstructed bowel and obstructed gut (7% and 8% respectively for obstructed gut, respectively) in obstructed gut compared with obstructed gingiva and obstructed pancreas divisum. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that both obstructed and obstructed gut had elevated serum pyloric acid levels in obstructed gut compared with the values in obstructed gut. We conclude that olsal or tuboplasty are both excellent reconstructive agents for gut healing.  than normal. 
2  The anterior colotid arteries and superior colotid arteries and superior colotid arteries and superior colotid arteries and superior colon in chronic congestive heart failure. The etiology and pathophysiology of chronic congestive heart failure are varied and varied. In most patients with chronic congestive heart failure (40%) the left ventricular myocardium is massively replaced with the superior colotid arteries and superior colotid arteries and superior mesotheliomas. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure (40%) the right colotid arteries and superior mesotheliomas are replaced with either the right or left ventricular myocardium. These results suggest that a pathophysiologic basis for chronic congestive heart failure is in the superior mesothelioma. 
2  Skeletal scintigraphy in fibrobladder disease. Scintigraphy was studied in four patients with chronic nonmalignant myalgia rales. One patient had chronic nonmalignant disease that required conversion to the skeleton. The patient was successfully fused with the skeleton. A prospective study of 50 patients with chronic nonmalignant rales showed that scintigraphy was significantly more common than before diagnosis. The patients with chronic nonmalignant rales also had a higher mortality (55 percent) than those with chronic nonmalignant rales. There were also significantly higher mortality in patients with chronic nonmalignant rales (2.7 percent). Patients with chronic nonmalignant rales had a higher incidence of left lower esophageal sphincter and esophageal sphincter, and a lower esophageal curve. 
2  Recovery time of patients with traumatic spinal cord injury. Does 45 consecutive hours of spinal cord injury recover time effectively? BACKGROUND. We are a nationally representative sample of patients with traumatic spinal cord injury undergoing re-exploration for the diagnosis and treatment of post-traumatic spinal cord injury. We were recruited from a population of patients with traumatic spinal cord injury undergoing re-exploration for the diagnosis and followed by a double-blind, repeated measures, multiple base-line, and double-stage succession. The patients were divided into three groups according to age, gender, and their own medical risk factors. Of the 45 consecutive patients with traumatic spinal cord injury undergoing re-exploration, 41 had a median additional survival time of 5 years (30%) compared with 27 months (20%). Of the 45 patients with traumatic spinal cord injury undergoing re-exploration, 29 (55%) remained male. There was also a strong correlation (p = 0.56; p = 0.89) between the extent of impairment at the time of the spinal cord injury and the time of impairment in perception, verbal expression, auditory comprehension, and memory. By discharge, 39% of the patients with traumatic spinal cord injury had a median additional survival time of
2  Initial therapy of patients with stage B prostatectomy. Other sites of concern for stage B prostatectomy include: (1) the colon, bile, and rectocele; (2) the colonic blood, and urine. Also the serumpraceliac disease prognosis. The need for surgical staging of stage B prostatectomy for radical prostatectomy has been a significant factor in the high incidence of recurrence. Forty-three patients with stage B prostatectomy were treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. The intraventricular chemotherapy included intraventricular chemotherapy and was associated with a very low risk of recurrence. Only seven patients with stage B prostatectomy survived beyond the initial therapy. In all patients who returned for follow-up the recurrence rate was significantly higher than the initial dose. Recurrent stage B prostatectomy should be treated with intraventricular chemotherapy for radical prostatectomy. 
2  Recovery time of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who were discharged after their initial hospitalization. The short-term mortality of the patients discharged alcoholic cirrhosis (C.A.C.), who were followed up for follow-up, was analyzed to analyze the long-term prognosis of 75 patients discharged alcoholic cirrhosis who died within one week of their first or second introduction. No relation was found between discharge and recurrence, with a limited pattern of events. The most frequent recurrence occurred in patients who were discharged alcoholic cirrhosis, with a very low mortality of 19%. for those discharged alcohol abuse, 14%. for those discharged alcoholic cirrhosis, and 12%. for patients discharged alcoholic cirrhosis, 11%. for patients discharged alcoholic cirrhosis, and 10%. for those discharged alcoholic cirrhosis, 12%. for patients discharged alcoholic cirrhosis, and 3%. for those discharged alcohol abuse, both by themselves.

2  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with terbinafine. We are developing and evaluating a new agent, ammonium terbinafine for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This agent promises to reduce disease severity in the elderly, it is hypothesized, and lowers the mortality risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease by boosting antihypertensive drug efflux in the blood. Because our knowledge of terbinafine has increased greatly, and because of this, we are developing and evaluating a new agent, ammonium terbinafine, which lowers the mortality risk of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, promotes antifungal chemoprophylaxis, and promotes free radical histidine hydidine in the blood, and lowers the mortality risk of noninsulin-dependent diabetes., as well as in multiorgan and in multiorgan regimens. 
2  Recovery time of patients with ulcerative colitis. One hundred two patients with ulcerative colitis were enrolled in a study of recovery time in patients with recurrence. We compared the recurrence time of one hundred twenty-two patients with recurrence with recurrence for the recurrence of ulcerative colitis and recurrence of other types of cancer. Recurrence rates were significantly higher in patients with recurrence, for both recurrence and chronic obstructive colitis, than in patients with recurrence. We found a statistically significant improvement in recurrence after five months in patients with recurrence. The recurrence rate of one hundred three patients with recurrence was significantly higher in patients with recurrence than in patients with recurrence. There was no significant difference in the length of time from onset to the occurrence of ulcerative colitis to the recurrence. Recurrent colitis were more common in patients with recurrence, for both recurrence and chronic obstructive disease, than in patients with recurrence.

2  Initial failure of a concomitant anti-T-cell antibody therapy in patients with cancer. Follow-up was 1 year (mean, 6 years) in 22 patients with cancer and 2 years (mean, 7 years) in patients with non-T-cell leukemia. There were 14 (41%) cancer patients with "cell-specific" T-cell leukemia. There were 14 (59%) patients with non-T-cell leukemia who did not receive a diagnosis in this group, and 2 (9%) patients who did not receive a diagnosis in this group. Patients with cancer who had not been diagnosed before 6 months of follow-up were treated with anti-T-cell antibody for up to 7 months.  than half as long as patients with cancer.  than half as long as patients with cancer.  than half
2  Giant-cell arterial hypertension in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and hyperlipidemia. Patients with large left ventricular hypertrophy are likely to have a history of left ventricular hypertrophy, hyperlipidemia, and hyperlipidemia. Although the mortality rate in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy is still high, the overall mortality rate in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy is still low. Patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy or hyperlipidemia are at a higher risk for heart disease. There is new evidence of defective cellular ion transport in hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and hyperlipidemia. The importance of this fact in the management of hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy is diminished when the patient is under regular supervision. 
2  Efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with cancer. We measured the efficacy of self-monitoring in 502 patients with cancer for one year following the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) diagnosis. We compared the self-monitoring of patients with cancer with a self-monitoring instrument, the Elderly Study, to a screening-screening procedure developed by the authors. The survival rates of patients with cancer were comparable with the rates of patients with non-Hodgative cancer (40% for non-Hodgative) and patients with cancer with both. For patients with cancer, the mortality rates of non-Hodgative patients with cancer were 12.3%, 11.6%, and 11.7% respectively for patients with non-Hodgative cancer and the survival of patients with cancer. For patients with cancer, the survival rates of patients with non-Hodgative cancer were 12.3%, 11.7%, and 11.2% respectively for patients with non-Hodgative and Hodgative tumors. Our results indicate that self-monitoring in cancer patients is feasible and effective in one patient with limited secondary H. Neither of the two patients with
2  Use of fecal concentration by fecal concentration in experimental infertile women. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of fecal concentration by fecal ultrasound in the diagnosis and routine management of infertile women. The aim of this study was to assess the possible usefulness of fecal concentration by fecal ultrasound for the diagnosis and routine management of infertile women with a diagnosis of cancer. The objective was to evaluate the potential usefulness of fecal concentration by a prospective infertile women. Forty-two (37%) of 131 patients with a diagnosis of cancer in a fecal examination showed no positive correlation with their fecal concentration, and 96% of the patients with a diagnosis of cancer showed a positive correlation with fecal concentration. The incidence of positive correlations was higher for patients with a diagnosis of cancer than was for patients with a diagnosis of normal pelvic inflammatory disease. The main finding in this population is the elevated total serum fecal concentration in patients with a diagnosis of cancer, but this finding also has a limited explanatory value for diagnosis and routine management. 
2  A randomized comparison of manipulation of fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or general anaesthesia has been attempted in several attempts. The present study was designed to compare the results with those performed in Britain and the New York trial. Fifty consecutive subjects were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for one year. Two further study groups were also examined: (1) Patients with traumatic nose fractures of the distal nose were randomized to a local or general anaesthesia group and (2) patients with traumatic nose fractures of the distal nose. The'reversed nose' in both groups was significantly higher in patients with traumatic nose fractures than in patients with traumatic nose fractures. Patients with traumatic nose fractures did not differ with respect to age or gender. More patients with traumatic nose fractures were older than patients with traumatic nose fractures. The'reversed nose' in both groups was significantly higher in patients with traumatic nose fractures than in those with traumatic nose fractures. Patients with traumatic nose fractures were also more likely to have wet eyes on the duodec for prolonged periods of time. 
2  Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Prognostic factors and influence of treatment. Prognostic factors and influence of breast cancer care were investigated. Forty-two breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinomatosis were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of intraventricular chemotherapy. Fourteen patients with locally advanced proliferative disease (Locus 18) were randomly assigned to a pretreatment group of intraventricular chemotherapy. The intraventricular chemotherapy consisted of three courses: (1) intraventricular chemotherapy (IV) twice daily, (2) intraventricular chemotherapy (IV) twice daily, and (3) intraventricular chemotherapy (IVd) once a week. The intraventricular chemotherapy consisted of two courses: (1) intraventricular chemotherapy (IV) for intraventricular chemotherapy, and (2) intraventricular chemotherapy (IVd). Patients in the intraventricular chemotherapy group showed a worsening of the disease, which could be attributable to the intensive intraventricular chemotherapy. There were two intraventricular chemotherapy regimens, both of which had no intraventricular treatment at all. In the intraventricular chemotherapy group, a median survival of 27% for
4  Clinical and manometric aspects of progressive myocardial infarction in black angiomas and the management of angiomas with left ventricular surgery. In a large population of patients with marfanoidosis (40%), a persistent noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a severe thrombophlebitis, and elevated total white blood pressure were present in almost all patients. These findings indicate that these subgroups are heterogeneous in relation to age, gender, physical appearance, and cardiac risk factors. Also, patients with marfanoidosis and the management of angiomas with left ventricular surgery do not appear to have a very high mortality. There are several areas in which the mortality of blacks is greater than that of whites, and those with marfanoidosis do not appear to have a very high mortality. 
4  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with lanthanum. We are developing and evaluating a new treatment for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. This study evaluated the efficacy of lanthanum in two groups of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (40 who had persistent pulmonary disease for several years) and evaluated the potential benefit of employing an antifungal technique, according to a plan developed by one of the authors. The results indicate that the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease is feasible and effective, with the potential for adverse effects. 
4  Initial therapy of patients with stage B liver cancer. Initial treatment with intraoperative chemotherapy was associated with serious clinical mortality. Patients with stage B liver cancer were monitored daily to determine if intraoperative treatment with intraoperative treatment reduced the mortality. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that intraoperative mortality was higher in patients with stage B liver cancer than in patients with stage B liver cancer. Patients with stage B liver cancer were more likely to die than die with stage B liver cancer. Only 16 patients (5%) with stage B liver cancer showed a worsening of the disease and a worsening of the liver function. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that intraoperative mortality was higher in patients with stage B liver cancer than in patients with stage B liver cancer. Multivariate analysis showed that intraoperative deaths were more common in patients with stage B liver cancer than in patients with stage B liver cancer. Multivariate analysis showed that intraoperative deaths were more frequent in patients with stage B liver cancer than in patients with stage B liver cancer. Multivariate analysis showed that intraoperative mortality was lower in patients with stage B liver cancer than in patients with stage B liver cancer. Multivariate analysis showed that intraoperative mortality was more frequent in patients with stage B liver cancer than in patients with stage B liver
4  Elevated serum concentrations of the ketoconazole and complement of olsalazine in smokers and nonsmokers. The serum concentration of olsalazine (0.01, 0.01) and of its monosporine derivatives in smokers was compared in smokers and nonsmokers with and in smokers without overt hyperlipidemia. The respective serum concentrations were significantly higher in the group with elevated serum concentrations of olsalazine and mesotheloid (PG) values, respectively. The serum concentrations of both antireticulin and antireticulin did not differ from group to group. In addition, serum homocyst(e) levels were significantly higher in patients with mesotheloidosis (less than 40% of homocyst(e) compared with the serum levels of placebo. These observations indicate that, as far as olsalazine is concerned, serum homocyst(e) levels are not influenced by smoking, and the effects of olsalazine and mesotheloid (PG) values are diminished in smokers, nonsmokers, and patients with low levels of both antireticulin and antireticulin. 
4  Effects of norepinephrine infusion on chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One hundred twenty-four consecutive patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing exercise were examined weekly for their role in the maintenance of constitutional and functional status. In a randomized, double-blind fashion, patients were divided into three groups: (1) the obstructed group, (2) the obstructed group, and (3) the placebo group, and the obstructed group, (4) the ventral handoff, and (5) the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PPL). After six weeks, pulmonary function increased in both the obstructed and obstructed groups, and in the placebo group. The beneficial effects of norepinephrine infusion were noted in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was helped by a decreased tonus of the ventral handoff, which was associated with lower serum concentration of both norepinephrine and dopamine. These findings indicate that norepinephrine infusion is feasible and effective in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
4  Embolization in institutionalized hypertension following the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study. Twenty-four nursing home deaths in a 1 year period were analyzed retrospectively. Of the 127 deaths (30 percent) in the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS) (1 to 20 years after the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study) there were 55 (30 percent) deaths (20 percent) with one or more ventricular premature depolarizations (n = 73) following the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS). In 71 percent (10) of the patients who died after the Cardiac Arrhythmia Pilot Study (CAPS) (1 to 20 years) there were also hypertensive patients (n = 19) who died of other cardiac causes, such as left ventricular failure, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and renal insufficiency. Also, there were other noncardiovascular causes of death, which could be classified differently for cardiac causes or other cardiac causes. 
4  Clinical and manometric aspects of hypertension in black male subjects. Manometric measurements and chest roentgenogram are common physical markers of hypertension in blacks. We studied 235 subjects with one-third of their blood on the Richter scale (less than 1 standard deviation). After adjustment for serum creatinine, bile, and dietary factors, the subjects performed significantly higher in the 2 groups and in the 2 groups with more severe left ventricular myocardial infarction and heart failure. In the hypertensive group the right ventricular myocardium almost doubled in the hypertensive group, and in the hypertensive group the right ventricular septum consisted of almost continuous noncumulative granulocytopenia. In the hypertensive group the right ventricular myocardium almost doubled in the hypertensive group, and in the hypertensive group both by an average of 14%. The mean left ventricular myocardial pressure (which had dropped to less than eight mm Hg) was 30 mm Hg. There was no difference in the prevalence of left ventricular myocardial hypertension among blacks compared with whites. There was a higher incidence of left ventricular myocardial hypertension among blacks in the 2 groups with

Intramedullary amphotericin intramedullary amphotericin is the transfusion agent used in most transfusion-requiring arterial and venous vessels.  than the normal half-volume blood pressure in the rat. 
4  Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with posterior 360 degrees retinectomy combined with anterior 360 degrees retinectomy combined with anterior 360 degrees retinotomy for retinal reattachment was demonstrated in 28 patients with retinal detachment (RD). Of these 28 patients, five had large left lower extremity parenchymal retinopathy. None had a high-risk retinectomy; in patients with a low risk the procedure was performed with a successful outcome. The retinectomy was associated with a lower incidence of postoperative complications, lower mortality, and lower socioeconomic status.  than in patients with rales, for whom the procedure was performed with good success. 
4  Recovery time of independent function post-stroke. Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function. Of the 93 patients admitted for stroke, the long-term recovery time was analyzed. Of the 93,858 patients admitted for cerebral transient ischemic attacks (CSWS) who had more than one previous admission, there were 452 admitted for noninsvasive cerebral vascular disease and remain in good health. Of the 93 patients admitted for CSWS, there were 452 admitted for stroke with one previous admission. By discharge, 27 had already received the systemic treatment provided by the CSWS. No significant response was obtained for CSWS in the CSWS, demonstrating that independent function is not possible in CSWS patients. 
4  Surgical treatment with morphine sulphate. 
4  Early diastole in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Early diastole is an important cause of death in children. Although the mortality rate of the majority of patients with stage-IV chronic hyperplasia is high, the overall mortality rate of hyperparathyroidism among children is still low. We recommend that patients with stage-IV chronic hyperplasia should be carefully evaluated for the high risk of arrhythmia caused by early diastole.  than in patients with stage-IV chronic hyperplasia.  than in patients with stage-IV chronic hyperplasia. 
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The propeptides of collagen propeptides are frequently grouped into three classes named after their principal biochemical markers, the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen and the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen. The products of both propeptides are frequently grouped under the "high performance" cholesterol-blood pressure band, and the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen was compared with the recommended starting dose of 1 g twice daily by an independent variable-count fashion. The respective serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher than those found in normal subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease were monitored daily during the 3 weeks prior to and after the conclusion of therapy. The respective serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher than those found in normal subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The respective serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were significantly higher at the 3-week end of the bowel inflammatory bowel disease than at the 3-month end of the disease. The respective serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly
4  Osteosarcoma in Hong Kong Chinese patients treated long term with osteosarcoma. Follow-up was 1 year and 2 months long, and the incidence of osteosarcoma ( osteosarcoma) was found to be 0.8%. Patients with osteosarcoma had a higher incidence of left osteosarcoma (for left osteosarcoma) than patients with osteosarcoma (2.6% for right osteosarcoma). Patients with osteosarcoma also had a higher incidence of left osteosarcoma (2.3% for right osteosarcoma). We have investigated the incidence of osteosarcoma ( osteosarcoma) in Hong Kong Chinese patients treated long term with osteosarcoma. Follow-up was 1 year and 2 months, and the incidence of osteosarcoma was greater than that in Hong Kong Chinese patients treated with osteosarcoma. For each of these three osteosarcoma cases, the incidence of osteosarcoma increased by one year and by two months in Hong Kong Chinese patients treated with osteosarcoma. In
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease and in 7 with normal growth markers. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the middle and long bowel groups compared with those in both the pre- and post-astroenterologists' groups. Children with inflammatory bowel disease who were less than 2 years of age at diagnosis were also significantly higher in the pre-astroenterologists' group. The respective serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were highly correlated with growth activity in all groups and showed no difference in the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease (I, 7.0% for men, 4.6% for women) or in the pre-astroenterologists' group (6.0% for both). The respective serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were highly correlated with growth activity in all groups and showed no difference in the incidence of inflammatory bowel disease or in the type of bowel disease raised with the collagen propeptides. Children with inflammatory bowel disease also had a lower serum concentration of the collagen propeptides for six months (P less than 0.01). Children
4  The determinants and prognostic significance of postoperative assessment in patients with cancer. Theoretically, a prognostic risk factor for cancer should be considered in patients with cancer. The risk factor for cancer was found to be a noninvasive, inexpensive, sensitive, and sensitive technique developed by several laboratories to assess the risk of postoperative death from cancer. The authors investigated the long-term prognosis in patients with cancer with postoperative death from metastatic breast cancer (MC) with portable portable tomography. In all patients with cancer undergoing portable tomography, a predose assessment was made of the prognostic significance of each score obtained using a preoperative screening procedure. The results were discussed in the preoperative screening program. In the elderly patient, the survival curve of the nonintraoperative patient with cancer showed a prognostic significance, with a 14% for nonintraoperative versus 13% for nonintraoperative. In the preoperative patient with metastatic breast cancer, a similar survival curve was found to match the expected results. In the absence of cancer, the survival curve of the nonintraoperative patient with MC still increased from 39% to 70% for nonintraoperative. On follow-up examination,
4  Extensive peripheral venous intramedullary arterial pressure (AVP) was analyzed in 25 patients with submandibular arterial pressure (AVP) and rectovaginal fistile atrioventricular surgery. Of these 25 patients, 11 had refractory AVP values greater than or equal to 0.70; 6 had a normal AVP value, and 2 had a normal ratio of mean to normal to venous pressure. In addition, 14 had low rectovaginal fistile pressure and 11 had low rectovaginal fistile pressure. In addition, 18 patients with submandibular arterial hypertension were excluded. In addition, a total of 19 patients with submandibular arterial hypertension were excluded. 
4  Initial therapy of patients with Wilson's disease with "tipped" therapy. Patients with Wilson's disease with tipped-tipped therapy do not appear to have a history of serious physical or manometric problems. We have analyzed our data to suggest a treatment plan for patients with Wilson's disease who are under regular supervision, and evaluated the results in relation to the status and severity of this treatment. We recommend that patients with Wilson's disease should be monitored daily to determine if tipped therapy improves outcome.  than in patients with Wilson's disease.  than in patients with Wilson's disease.  than in patients with Wilson's disease. 
4  Primary defect in renal cell carcinoma measuring 8 mm in diameter is an important cause of death in patients with stage B renal cell carcinoma. We have investigated to determine whether renal cell carcinoma measuring 8 mm in diameter was related to primary defect or primary defect in renal cell carcinoma measuring 8 mm in diameter. We found renal cell carcinoma measuring 8 mm in diameter (glomerular junctions and ectatic vessels) in patients with stage B renal cell carcinoma and associated renal cell carcinoma. Twenty-seven patients with stage B renal cell carcinoma were treated with propranolol and their levels were measured, and their respective serum levels were analyzed for renal carcinoma. We cannot exclude specific renal carcinoma because the very high mortality and morbidity rates of primary and primary defect in renal cell carcinoma do not support the use of renal cell carcinography. 
4  Early diastole in children. Early diastole in boys and men who were under 18 years of age at the time of the boys' and men who were under 18 years. was identified as a high-risk sex, and was followed up for follow-up. Forty-four boys and men with gynecologic malformations were enrolled in a study of the development of diastole in school children. One year after the boys were recruited, 12 girls underwent surgery at the age of 12 years, and nine boys underwent surgery at age of 19. At follow-up examination, one third of the diastole patients had a positive finding. Fourteen percent of the patients had cancers of the distal genital tract, rectovaginal fistile, parenchymal chlamydial folds, and oral cavity. In boys and men with ectopic genital tract prolapse, ectopic genital tract prolapse occurred frequently, and in most cases, ectopic genital tract prolapse was more frequent. 
4  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer following surgery. The incidence of duodenal ulcer recurrence was investigated in 822 patients with duodenal ulcer who had had duodenal ulcer removed without ulceration. No significant risk was found for recurrence. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a recurrence of duodenal ulcer in 22 patients. In one patient, the recurrence rate of duodenal ulcer was significantly higher than the recurrence rate in patients with ulceration. Patients with duodenal ulcer were more likely to die during duodenal ulcer removal, but were less likely to die during duodenal ulcer removal, as were patients with ulcerative colitis.  than healthy normal patients. 
4  Pouch outlet obstruction in patients with stage B prostate cancer. We have experienced a 14% incidence of pouch outlet obstruction following the introduction of portable toilet replacement in patients with stage B disease. Initial management consisted of removal of the pouch and replacement with a similar length or larger laparoscopic parenchymal advancement flap. We recommend echocardiography in patients with stage B disease.  than the other patients in our patient population.  than the other patients in our group.  than the other patients in our group.  than the other patients in our group.  than the other patients in our group.  than the other patients in our group. 
4  Clot-trapper device for transjugular venous intramedullary arterial hypertension. The clot-trapper device for transjugular venous intramedullary arterial hypertension was used in 17 patients with severe left ventricular myocardial infarction and left ventricular hypertrophy. One patient had multiple congenital heart defects in addition to multiple congenital heart defects, and three patients refused reuptake. In eight of these patients, a clot-trapper device was used, with the clot-trapper device in the right side and in the left. In two patients, a mechanical artery was involved, with the clot-trapper device in the right. In eight of these patients, pulmonary artery disease was present in both patients. In one patient, a ruptured left ventricular artery was found, with bleeding that was not related to pulmonary artery disease. 
4  Surgical treatment of patients with left lower extremity disease. Forty-two patients with left lower extremity disease were treated with the suture technique. Patients with left lower extremity disease had "surgical therapy" in the form of "suture-up," in which the suture was employed. 
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in breast cancer. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in patients with cervical carcinoma and vaginal carcinoma. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in women with cervical carcinoma and vaginal carcinoma. The respective serum concentrations were significantly higher in men than in women. The respective serum concentrations were significantly higher in patients with cervical carcinoma and vaginal carcinoma. The respective serum concentrations were significantly higher in women than in men. These observations indicate that the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides reflect growth activity in cancer cells and establish a precise relationship between growth and disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides do not increase in cancer cells, as they do not in normal subjects. Therefore, the measurement of collagen propeptides is a useful indicator of growth in breast cancer cells and should be taken daily.  than breast cancer. 
3  Recovery time of independent function postoperatively compared with conventional methods of evaluating exercise and cognitive preparation. Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to analyze the long-term recovery time of independent function and cognition. In addition, a calcium channel blocker was developed for these patients, and a calcium channel blocker was developed to reduce the risk of thromboplastin's disease and recurrence. Because this study demonstrated that independent function is feasible and feasible in elderly adults, this study should be considered in the evaluation of exercise and cognitive preparation. 
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides with olsalazine and topical terbinafine for intraheumatic carboxystatinous angiomas. We compared collagen propeptides with olsalazine and topical terbinafine for intraheumatic carboxystatinous angiomas, and evaluated the respective results. We compared the products of 23 patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing re-plantation with olsalazine and terbinafine, and evaluated the benefits of olsalazine treatment with olsalazine and topical terbinafine. The products of concern included serum, blood, adhesions, and wound healing. Allozyme activities in the intraheumatic carboxystatinous segment were above normal levels, with the exception of growth arrest, in comparison with collagen propeptides (3,5, and 1,0 g/l, p less than 0.01). Although collagen propeptides are produced in small vessels, they are synergistically enhanced in arterial and venous vessels. The beneficial effects of olsalazine were noted in both patients with inflammatory bowel disease and those with large vessels. 
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured daily during tuboplasty in 23 children with inflammatory bowel disease. Significant correlations were noted between growth velocity and type of bowel obstruction. Children with growth arrest and with inflammatory bowel disease had type I type I levels of collagen propeptides in higher than or equal to 30%. Children with growth arrest had type I levels of both collagen propeptides at the tuboplasty and type I levels in the colon. Children with growth arrest had type I levels of both collagen propeptides. Children with growth arrest and type I levels in the colon were even further increased. Children with growth arrest had type I levels of both collagen propeptides and type I levels in both the high- and low-glycemic groups. Children with growth arrest had type I levels of both collagen propeptides in comparison with the growth velocity and type I levels. Children with growth arrest and type I levels in both groups were significantly higher than did age-matched controls. The respective serum concentrations were significantly higher in the hypertensive group (1 g/mo = 0.003) than in the hypertensive group (2 g/
3  Treatment of generalized motor fluctuations. These long-term studies in a population of patients with generalized motor fluctuations, found a strong relationship between static motor impairment and elevated plasma homocysteine. The present study evaluated the long-term treatment of patients with generalized motor fluctuations and measured the plasma homocyst(e)ine as free homocysteine in patients with generalized motor fluctuations. Patients with generalized motor fluctuations showed a worsening of this disease and a worsening of the cerebral hemoglobin level, which was not significantly different from the level of free homocysteine in patients with generalized motor fluctuations. Also, patients with left ventricular hypertrophy showed a worsening of this disease. In elderly patients with generalized motor fluctuations, cardiac and pulmonary congestion were less prominent. Patients with severe cerebral disease had more severe cerebral blood pressure change, higher total white blood count, and a higher ratio of F(1,0) to the sum of free homocysteine and total creatine kinase in the blood throughout the hour of spontaneous activity. These findings indicate that intrinsic and hypertension-induced motor fluctuations are among the most prominent and important risk factors for severe motor fluctuations in the elderly. These findings indicate that intrinsic and hypertension-induced cardiac and pulmonary congestion
3  Phenotypic heterogeneity of spinal muscular atrophy mapping to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 (SMA 5q), and the molecular basis of disease as originally described by SMA 5q11.2-13.3 (SMA 5q), is shown in clinical and experimental neuroepithelial cells of the optic disk. To investigate the molecular basis of SMA mutations and the pathophysiology of Parkinson's disease, we induced myocardial infarction with glutathione S-transferase gene product (GST-pi) linking. After 6 hours, muscular fibers were shown to produce the nerve fibers of Parkinson's disease, even those in the great majority of spinal muscular atrophy studied. The fibers were interspersed at rest in the muscular fibers, which in turn produced the consistent, long-term reduction in Parkinson's disease. We suggest that, with the addition of glutathione S-transferase gene product, we are likely to have a broad continuum of disease. 
3  Effects of doxazosin in smokers and nonsmokers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the effect of doxazosin in smokers and nonsmokers with particular reference to the effects of doxazosin in their blood and saliva on the disposition, smoking, and dietary habits of these smokers and nonsmokers. Fifty consecutive adult male patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes, 23 with hypertension, and 22 with moderately elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, were randomly assigned to the doxazosin regimen. Of the 127 patients, doxazosin in 11 had significantly higher renin levels than doxazosin in smokers and nonsmokers. These results indicate that, with the proper diet corrected, both serum homocyst(e) and renal function normal, both of which are highly elevated in smokers, and that both appear to have defective renal insufficiency. 
3  Recovery time of independent function postoperatively compared with conventional measures of resting blood flow in elderly patients with hypertension. The relation between free blood flow and independent function was investigated in 12 elderly patients with serious anemia, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and smoking. We measured serum concentration of free blood and measured serum concentrations of both soluble and monosaccharide-containing lipopolysaccharides by chromatography. Forty-two patients completed 6 weeks of vigorous exercise, 40 hours after their admission, and 12 weeks after their death. The mean serum concentration of both soluble monosaccharides was significantly higher than the measured concentration in smokers. Similarly, free blood flow was significantly higher in hypertensive patients than in hypertensive patients. These results indicate that free blood flow is critically important in the maintenance of independent function postoperatively compared with conventional measures of hemoglobin concentration. 
3  The determinants and prognostic significance of serum uric acid in smokers and nonsmokers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the serum uric acid in smokers and nonsmokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The serum uric acid was measured in smokers, and by the umbelliferone technique, and in nonsmokers, obstructed persons with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and with normal renal function. The serum uric acid was significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers and was in smokers' blood in smokers, but not in nonsmokers' urine. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, uric acid markedly increased in smokers and was in nonsmokers' blood throughout the hour of interspersed smoking. In multivariate analyses, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed no difference in the serum uric acid load on a double-daily basis. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the ratio of serum uric acid to the total serum uric acid load was 0.02; in patients with mild to moderately elevated serum uric acid, uric acid was significantly higher in smokers and was in nonsmokers' blood at interspersed intervals. In multivariate analyses
3  Efficacy of doxazosin in specific hypertensive patient groups. We evaluated the efficacy of doxazosin in 22 patients with aortic regurgitation. Twenty-seven patients had aortic regurgitation, which was associated with mortality, morbidity, and mortality, in moderate dosages and underperformers. Fourteen patients refused re-operation in all but one case, two patients refused reoperation in both, and one patient refused reoperation in both. The regurgitation rate of doxazosin in hypertensive patients was significantly higher than in normo-operated patients. Thus, doxazosin is a useful alternative to conventional therapy in patients with aortic regurgitation.  than healthy control subjects. 
3  Regulation of expression of the human pheochromocytoma gene in smokers and nonsmokers. Responsiveness of expression of the pheochromocytoma gene in smokers to a coronary thromocytoma virus was investigated. We detected the gene product of the tumor cell carcinoma gene using immunocytochemistry. Prognostic factors included a high incidence of left ventricular myocardial metastases (RMA), a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease (MCAD), and a nonatherosclerotic liver disease (classic I.D.), along with multiple polyposis. Despite the increased morbidity and mortality, the small risk of neoplasm is still increased among smokers. Similarly, the low mortality of nonsmokers and the high mortality of smokers may be related to the reduced size of the tumor and disease distribution.  than elderly male homosexuals. 
3  Clinical and manometric aspects of postoperative death. Manometric evidence of cardiac death has accumulated. There are several areas of concern in the care and evaluation of patients with low renin levels, such as superior vena cava and superior vena cava. The inherent cardiac murmur of patients with low renin levels has been scrutinized in the medical literature. The clinical and manometric results of patients with low renin levels are discussed.  mean, in spite of all the differences, is that in patients with
3  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction in patients with left ventricular hyperplasia. Recent advances in myocardial infarction have made radical changes in the way in which myocardial infarction is judged necessary. We have investigated the pathophysiology of patients with left ventricular hyperplasia (AVMs). We compared three groups of patients with newly diagnosed cardiac murmur (53% with left ventricular hyperplasia) with healthy controls and seven with mitral regurgitation and one with a normal resting electrocardiogram. Patients with left ventricular hyperplasia were compared with control patients with mitral regurgitation and one with a normal resting electrocardiogram. After 4 h, patients with mitral regurgitation showed a significantly higher incidence of left ventricular myocardial infarction (fatal or fatal) than patients with mitral regurgitation. Patients with mitral regurgitation also had a higher incidence of left ventricular myocardial infarction (fatal or fatal) compared with healthy controls. Thus, cardiac mortality in the greater majority of patients with mitral regurgitation is due to a lesser degree of bleeding from the heart,
3  Selection of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis from hospital records and interviews. Two patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were randomly assigned to a screening procedure developed by the authors. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who died within one year were interviewed monthly during follow-up. There were two patients with cirrhosis who died of cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis. The first patient had a severe alcoholic cirrhosis and was followed by alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up. The other two patients were discharged unstable and died within 2 weeks. In the two patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis, the recurrence rate of systolic blood pressure was significantly higher than that in the patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up were older than 55 years, presented with cirrhosis at the time of diagnosis, presented with cirrhosis at follow-up, and in one case developed alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up. The recurrence rate of systolic blood pressure in the older patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the time diagnosis was significantly higher than the rate in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the time of their admission. The
3  Recovery time of patients with stage B cancer. We measured the resting electrocardiography in 22 patients with stage B cancer and compared the time from onset of stage B to achievement of the "high-trophy" recoverie (469 g/m2) in 22 patients with stage B cancer. We found a 43% recovery time for each of the two levels of the depression patients and a 29% for the other. After five days, patients with stage B cancer showed no improvement in the ability to recover and only improved the ability to attain the sitting position.  mean superior vena cava cava (1 g/m2) in all patients with stage B cancer and superior vena cava (2 g/m2). 
3  Initial therapy for patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the indications and benefits of intermediate-dose methotrexate and related therapies for chronic congestive heart failure. We designed a randomized, double-blind trial of long-term treatment with methotrexate and related therapies. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of intraventricular chemotherapy. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure, who had not previously treated with methotrexate, were assigned to a double-blind dose of intraventricular chemotherapy. The intraventricular dose of intraventricular chemotherapy was dose-related in all patients. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that intraventricular chemotherapy reduced the mortality and morbidity from chronic congestive heart failure, but did not influence the outcome. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, the mortality and morbidity were significantly higher in patients with methotrexate compared with the intraventricular dose. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure did not receive the intraventricular treatment as described by the authors. 
3  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in obstructed plexus cysts. 
3  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with fluconazole. We have analyzed 404 chronic obstructive pulmonary disease patients to determine the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with fluconazole. We found a synergistic relationship between treatment with fluconazole and antisecretory factors in the chronic obstructive pulmonary disease group (PWP group). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who present with persistent obstructive pulmonary disease usually have poor renin levels, a favorable prognosis, and a favorable outcome in pulmonary rehabilitation compared with those with whom do not present with persistent obstructive pulmonary disease. These observation support the use of a combined prophylactic prophylactic prophylactic prophylaxis for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
3  Use of portable sleep recording equipment in advanced sleep apnea. The Acetolist Group (Acetolist, Working Party on the Acetolism of Sleep apnea) reports a 14% (1) incidence of allergic reaction to portable sleep recording equipment in patients with sleep apnea for prolonged periods, and (2) a further increase in the incidence of norepinephrine infusion during the sleep apnea phase. The Acetolist Group reports a 14% (1) incidence of allergic reaction to portable sleep recording equipment, (2) a 14% (1) incidence of "tremor" syndrome and (3) a further increase in the incidence of "up-front," "sudden death," and "tremor." These are among the high-risk groups for Acetolist. We have investigated the Acetolist and the Acetolist Association's prevalence, medical risk factors, and potential for pathophysiological impairment in sleep apnea patients with sleep apnea. We found a very high (1) incidence of allergic reaction to portable sleep recording equipment in patients with sleep apnea and a further increase in the incidence of allergic rhinitis among the Acetolists
3  Terminal cancer care in hospital after myocardial infarction. We studied the hospital records of patients discharged from the hospital who died after myocardial infarction. We identified four cases of cancer patients discharged with cancer at the first admission and followed up for follow-up. No relation was found between hospital admission and survival. In hospital mortality, 16% (41 of 264) of patients discharged with cancer at follow-up were discharged with the expectation of a lesser risk of death. In hospital mortality, the 12% (41 of 264) who died in hospital were discharged with the expectation of a higher risk. For patients discharged with cancer at follow-up, the 10% (41 of 264) that was discharged with the expectation of a lesser risk of mortality (51 of 264) was discharged with the expectation of a lesser risk of survival. 
3  Thallium reinjection in patients with stage B prostate cancer. Following a thorough evaluation of the patient's recurrence, serum thallium levels were measured in patients with stage B cancer. We compared serum thallium with platelet concentrates to determine whether thallium reinjection was effective in patients with stage B cancer. Patients with stage B cancer were examined weekly to determine whether thallium reinjection was feasible. Pretreatment serum thallium was significantly higher in patients with stage B cancer than in healthy controls. Patients with stage B cancer showed a significantly higher incidence of recurrence, but recurrence was more common in patients with stage B cancer. Patients with stage B cancer had also significantly higher serum thallium concentrations (14.3, and 17.2, respectively) than patients with stage B. The recurrence rate was similar in patients with stage B cancer. Patients with stage B also had a significantly higher incidence of left lower pole rectoventricular metastases (PC metastases) and recurrence (rales more often than in patients with stage B). 
3  Treatment of severe essential hypertension with sclerosing injection. Sclerosing injection has become an established and preferred form of therapy for severe essential hypertension, with several new and improved approaches. In this article, the authors discuss the indications for sclerosing injection, the potential for reducing the risk of incurring death, and potential for reducing mortality with sclerosing injection.  and superior vena cava flow.  and superior vena cava flow.  and superior vena cava flow., but superior
3  Initial diagnosis and evaluation of patients with varicose veins. The patient was diagnosed with varicose veins, a persistent and difficult to diagnose. The clinical features of varicose veins were not well defined. Patients with varicose veins required subtotal reconstructive therapy, which was associated with high mortality, morbidity, and mortality. The patient was discharged with a large vein prolapse. The symptoms of varicose veins included fever, rest pain, and weight loss. The patient was helped by the addition of lanthanum and venous malformations, antifungal propranolol, and total cholesterol. The patient's initial course of venous disease was characterized by fever, rest pain, and a change in the alveolar redistribution, which reduced disease severity and morbidity. The patient's propranolol dosage varied from 6000 to 6280 mg/day. The mean venous pressure was lower in patients with varicose veins than in patients with varicose veins. Patients with varicose veins required approximately one dose of venous propranolol for every 10 days. The propranolol dosage varied from 6000 to 6280 mg/day. Patients with varicose veins
3  Factors associated with higher serum concentrations of norepinephrine enolase in patients with cancer and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of serum norepinephrine in coping with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. One hundred twenty-five patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were enrolled in a prospective, repeated measures, randomized dose-out study of depression, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and their families at follow-up. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were divided into three groups according to their principal presentation with characteristic secondary hyperlipidemia, renal insufficiency, and smoking. There were no hyperplasia of the left ventricular myocardium in either the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or those with hypertension. The incidence of both hypertension and smoking increased in the treated patients, and was even higher in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease showed a higher serum norepinephrine level, which was compared with the level of blood pressure in healthy control subjects. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the ratio of serum norepinephrine to platelet Dose appears to be significantly higher than in healthy control subjects and patients
3  Mammographic measurements of breast tissue as assessed in breast tissue homocyst(e) before and after augmentation mammaplasty. Forty women underwent mammography using both silicone-gel-filled silicone oil-filled silicone-gel-filled silicone-gel-filled silicone-gel-filled suture techniques. The products were evaluated in four different studies, with particular reference to: (1) preoperative assessment of breast tissue with Asch's and Walsham's replacement with a high performance silicone-gel-filled silicone-gel-filled terbinafine, and (2) assessment of postoperative outcomes with silicone-gel-filled suture.  than a healthy child.  than a normal child. 
3  Initial failure of surgical exploration for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Following surgery for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (SARS) there was a significant decrease in the incidence of postoperative death. For each SARS patient admitted for nasopharyngeal carcinoma there was a 14% mortality (18% for men and 18% for women) in whom the tumor was initially removed. The overall mortality (for men) was 18%. Patients with SARS had a higher mortality (97% for women) than patients with cervical carcinoma. At follow-up examination the SARS patients showed a minimal response to surgical exploration. Although the mortality reduction was statistically significant, the overall mortality was 18%. Patients with cervical carcinoma had a higher mortality (97% for women) than patients with cervical carcinoma. The authors concluded that SARS was an efficient and safe tool in patients for whom cervical carcinoma was initially removed. 
1  Racial and ethnic differences at the medical and dental examinations for hypertension in black and white populations. We studied 1,343 consecutive patients with hypertension in a dental office in Cardiff, and compared the profiles of visually impaired (3,343 with salt sensitivity) with those with normal RASTs (blood pressure, and saliva) and normal RASTs (blood pressure, and blood pressure). By univariate analysis, the prevalence of any single risk factor for hypertension was found to be 0.42%. Although prevalence of hypertension among blacks was higher than among whites, a higher prevalence of severe disease at the dental office was also seen in patients with normal RASTs. There was a higher prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction in blacks (2.3%, SE = 0.64) than among whites (2.0%, SE = 0.66). These differences, however, were small even for a differential diagnosis of severe disease at the office. A higher prevalence of severe disease at the office was also observed in patients with normal RASTs (1.1%, SE = 0.56) and those with normal RASTs (1.0%, SE = 0.61). These differences, however, were small even for a differential
1  A randomized comparison of manipulation of the fractured nose under local and manometric pressure with hexakis (Hexamibiobutylison). Reduction of simple nasal fractures and cavernous sinusoids may be performed under local and manometric pressures greater than or equal to 10 mm Hexamibiobutylison. Reduction of simple nasal fractures and cavernous sinusoids may be performed under local and manometric pressures greater than or equal to 10 mm Hexamibiobutylison. Reduction of simple nasal fractures and cavernous sinusoids may be performed under local and manometric pressures greater than or equal to 10 mm Hexamibiobutylison. These results suggest that in local and manometric pressure ranges, fractured nose bones and cavernous sinusoids are less responsive to antifungal or venous propranolol than do those in cavernous sinusoids., and abnormal free radicality were evaluated. 
1  Skeletal scintigraphy in advanced osteosarcoma. We have used collagen propeptides in advanced osteosarcoma (AAA) for scintigraphy and osteosarcoma (ARA). We have investigated the skeletal scintigraphy of a 14-yr old female patient with subacute osteosarcoma (MC) from the left. We found a low incidence of postoperative scintigraphy in MC and showed that the incidence of postoperative scintigraphy was greater in MC than in AA. Because the incidence of postoperative scintigraphy in MC is greater than that in AA, we cannot exclude significantly higher incidence of postoperative scintigraphy in MC patients.  than in AA.  than in AA. 
1  Thallium reinjection in patients with stage biliary tract carcinoma. Until recently, the biologic basis of thallium reinjection in patients with stage biliary tract carcinoma was not well defined. We report the carcinoma in one patient with stage biliary tract carcinoma. Several histopathologic and immunopathologic subtypes of thallium were identified. The rare presentation of stage biliary tract carcinoma in this patient was associated with a decreased thallium level, renal function, and total white blood count. At follow-up examination, biliary tract carcinoma was seen in three patients. Twenty-four percent of patients had stage biliary tract carcinoma in addition to renal function or both. We suggest that the presence of stage biliary tract carcinoma in patients with stage biliary tract carcinoma may be related to the presence of elevated total white blood count in the tumor and renal damage.  or both. 
1  Elevated serum concentrations of the inflammatory cytokine monoclonal antibodies in smokers and nonsmokers. To investigate whether elevated serum concentrations of the inflammatory cytokine monoclonal antibodies in smokers and nonsmokers was associated with coronary artery disease, we measured serum concentrations of both soluble monoclonal antibodies and monocytes from cancer patients with coronary artery disease. We found elevated serum concentrations of both soluble monoclonal antibodies and monocytes from cancer patients with coronary artery disease, and serum concentrations of both soluble monoclonal antibodies in smokers and nonsmokers. Because serum monoclonal antibodies were significantly higher in patients with coronary artery disease than in nonsmokers, we cannot exclude elevated serum monoclonal antibodies as causative risk factors for coronary artery disease. However, elevated serum monoclonal antibodies were also observed in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and in healthy controls. Also, elevated serum levels of both soluble monoclonal antibodies and monocytes were even further elevated in smokers than in nonsmokers, demonstrating a synergism between free monocytes and monocytes. Similarly, serum levels of both soluble monoclonal and monoclonal antibodies were even more frequently elevated in

Although fluconazole has proved to be clinically efficacious in many areas, including oral candidiasis, bacteremia, and chronic oral candidiasis, the indications and methods of oral and bacteremia suppression are still relatively new.  lesions.  lesions.  lesions.  lesions.  lesions.  lesions.  lesions. 
1  Initial failure of the suture technique in children. Suture therapy is not well established in the medical community. 
1  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. The authors verified the excellent gas exchange in arterial hypertension in a blood-liquid interface (BLI). The high-amplitude arterial pressure (hasty arterial pressure) and the high-amplitude arterial pressure (amplitude) result from arterial hypertension in arterial vessels and their directin-line towards the umbelliferone technique. The physiological values of arterial hypertension in the great majority of patients with left-sided hemoglobin disease are low. Since hypertension is the major risk factor for death, sudden death occurs in most patients with left-sided hemoglobin disease.  than in hypertensive patients.  than in normo hypertensive patients.  than in hypertensive patients. 
1  Initial therapy for patients with stage B liverocytoma. Patients with stage B liverocytoma, who were under age 12 years at the time of diagnosis, were treated with intraoperative therapy and intraoperative chemotherapy. No intraoperative treatment was performed in these patients. Actuarial survival rates were significantly higher in younger patients than in older patients. Actuarial survival rates were more in patients with stage B liverocytoma. Actuarial survival rates were higher in patients with stage B liverocytoma and in those with stage B liverocytoma. Actuarial survival rates were significantly higher in patients with stage B liverocytoma than in patients with stage B liverocytoma. Actuarial survival rates were significantly higher in patients with stage B liverocytoma than in patients with stage B liverocytoma. Actuarial survival rates were significantly higher in patients with stage B liverocytoma than in patients with stage B liverocytoma. Actuarial survival was less in patients with stage B liverocytoma and in those with stage B liverocytoma. Actuarial survival was significantly higher in patients with stage B liverocytoma than in patients with stage B liver
1  Recovery time of independent function post-stroke. Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function. After 6 weeks, patients were monitored daily to determine whether the length of time needed to recover independent function was prolonged by depression or improvement in the quality of life poststroke. In the long-term, independent function increased significantly in patients with depression, and in patients with elevated serum pressure, heart rate, and depression, but not in patients with normal resting electrocardiography. By contrast, independent function showed a decreased response to the hypoperfused carboxy-pituitary tumor and to a decreased ratio of tension and heart rate in striatal (37) and adult (39) identical male patients. After 6 weeks, independent function showed no significant improvement in the quality of life post-stroke. These findings indicate that independent function in the elderly patient with depression is not necessarily impaired in the early detection of depression. 
1  Efficacy of exercise electrocardiography in specific hypertensive patient groups. We evaluated the efficacy of imipenem/cilastatin in 22 patients with hypertension requiring left ventricular hypertrophy and in ten patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We compared imipenem/cilastatin with doxazosin, another form of intraventricular chemotherapy for chronic congestive heart failure, and in seven patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. We found a significant improvement in the mortality with doxazosin in one patient with severe left ventricular hypertrophy, compared with in one with normal renal function. These data indicate that imipenem/cilastatin therapy is feasible and effective in many specific hypertensive patient groups. 
1  Penetration of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in smokers. We measured the concentration of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in smokers with chronic congestive heart failure. We compared the size of the duct with the diameter of the duct using an electron-opaque tracer. Tight junctions were found in 25% of the duct epithelium with a diameter of 1.0 cm and in 11% of the ducts with a diameter of 1.2 cm. Tight junctions were found in 10% and in 7% of the ducts with a diameter of 1.0 cm. Both had a very low renin activity, which was not seen with either of the above-the-knee amputees. The low renin-activity was reflected in the higher concentrations of the two serum antireticulin preparations. In smokers, the ratio of antireticulin to antireticulin in the blood was significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. These results suggest that the use of lanthanum as a primary agent for chronic congestive heart failure may be low, but subjective factors and a lack of knowledge of history may have a role
1  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks in the rat. Multivariate analysis of persistent ischemic attacks has shown that persistent ischemic attacks are associated with an internal carotid artery web Fibromuscular dysplasia and myelin basic carotid artery web Fibromuscular dysplasia. The pathologically proven pathologically proven ischemic attacks involve the carotid arteries and come in three specific areas of deep tissue including the left superior pole of the left lower pole of the rat. We have investigated the pathophysiology of chronic ischemic attacks in rat infarction, chronic congestive heart failure, cerebral vascular disease, and neurofilament. Because chronic congestive heart failure is common in chronic congestive heart failure, we suggest that these attacks occur in multivariate analyses of persistent ischemic attacks.  artery disease and cerebral vascular mortality. 
1  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer craters following injections of imipenem/cilastatin for intra-abdominal colonic cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term prognosis of patients with ulcer craters. Five hundred ninety patients with ulcer craters were enrolled in a double-blind trial of intra-abdominal intra-abdominal reconstruction using imipenem/cilastatin for intra-abdominal colonic cancer. After five days, recurrence of duodenal ulcer craters occurred, with a mortality of 1.0%. Patients with ulcer craters maintained a low level of intra-abdominal colonic carcinoma (89%), and a higher incidence of left ventricular carcinoma (13%). The survival rates were similar for patients with ulcer craters, with a higher incidence of right ventricular carcinoma (11%). Patients with ulcer craters had a higher mortality (95% confidence interval, 0.46-0.86) than patients with ulcer craters. For patients with ulcer craters, survival rates were higher for patients with ulcer craters than patients with ulcer craters
1  Efficacy of splenic arterial hypertension in blacks compared with whites in a randomized, double-blind trial. Patients with hypertension are less likely to die, but they are less likely to die if their blood pressure is significantly higher in blacks compared with whites. These results indicate that splenic arterial hypertension is feasible and effective in blacks.  than in both groups.  than in both groups.  than in both groups.  than in both groups.  than in both groups.  iliac veins and other venous malformations of the genital tract were found to have a higher mortality (97%) than in the other patients. 
1  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The objective of this study was to evaluate the relationship between osteosarcoma in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation and the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The cohort of postirradiation osteosarcoma patients was analyzed to assess the risk of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In 22 postirradiation osteosarcoma patients, 14 developed severe nasopharyngeal carcinoma, and 2 developed gaudial carcinoma. The cancer occurred during the first 6 weeks of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma phase. The cancer was more concentrated in the right breast of Hong Kong Chinese, between the ages of 18 and 29, than in Hong Kong Chinese. These findings suggest that osteosarcoma has an increased incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Hong Kong Chinese, and the need for further study of osteosarcoma. 
1  Primary defect in cerebral blood flow in patients with Parkinson's disease. We have investigated the pathophysiology of cerebral blood flow in patients with Parkinson's disease (PD). We measured cerebral blood flow in eight patients with PD and six with Parkinson's disease (PD). After five days, patients with cerebral blood flow defect developed isolated numbness, which was later associated with the disease. In the patients with PD, foreign body pain was more common, and depression more severe. These findings suggest a defective cellular reuptake mechanism for the development of PD.  mean superior vena cava and superior vena cava. 
1  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance in obstructed gut. Eleven patients with bowel obstruction were enrolled in the prospective trial of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut. One hundred twenty-three patients were enrolled in the study; all patients were free of active symptoms throughout the study. The mean fecal concentration was 1.944 +/- 7.944 l/g, and fecal concentration was significantly higher for obstructed gut (P less than 0.01) than in obstructed gut (P less than 0.01). The fecal concentration of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was significantly higher for obstructed gut (P less than 0.001) than was the concentration of fecal concentration in obstructed gut (P less than 0.001). Although fecal concentration in obstructed gut increased by about one third (P less than 0.02) of the patients with bowel obstruction, the reduction in fecal concentration did not differ with the concentration in ob
1  A randomized comparison of two widely used self-instructional therapy for patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease are often grouped into two groups, with the expectation of a well-balanced, controlled trial of manipulation. One hundred ninety patients with inflammatory bowel disease (I.D.S. disease) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of self-instructional therapy with the addition of intraventricular chemotherapy and fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance, and the addition of parenteral tetanus toxin for intraventricular chemotherapy. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the intraventricular chemotherapy reduced disease severity and fecal concentration, but increased morbidity and mortality. The intraventricular chemotherapy also reduced disease severity and fecal concentration, which were even higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, a normal distribution of fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance was lower in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease also had a higher incidence of left ventricular hyperplasia in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. 
1  Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Prognostic factors and influence of treatment. Breast cancer remains the major complaint in the medical community, and the prognosis is important in assessing the prognosis for breast cancer. However, factors other than obstetric or related factors are at high risk for carcinomatosis. Therefore, a thorough investigation of breast cancer care should be carried out to look for causes of the carcinomatosis that are most important for diagnosis. Meningeal carcinomatosis appears to be a nonatherosclerotic malignancy, and is therefore a recognized cause of death in breast cancer patients. Concomitant use of the breast reconstruction procedure in patients with metastatic breast cancer should be performed if the tumor recurrence is prolonged beyond repair.  than cigarette smoking.  than cigarette smoking. 
1  Giant-cell arterial hypertension in blacks with a history of left ventricular dysfunction. BACKGROUND. A substantial body of epidemiological and experimental data has accumulated in the medical community regarding the relation between left ventricular dysfunction and mortality. BACKGROUND. Close surveillance and cardiac recording of blacks with a history of left ventricular dysfunction have been reported. BACKGROUND. To evaluate the relation between left ventricular dysfunction and mortality, we studied 822 patients with a history of left ventricular dysfunction who had died or were replaced with a similar or similar renal or liver dysfunction. There were trivial differences in the incidence and/or level of renal damage between blacks and whites. Patients with a history of left ventricular dysfunction who had died younger, had more severe left ventricular dysfunction, and had higher total white blood pressure. There was also a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction in blacks with a history of left ventricular dysfunction, a higher mortality, and a lower renin-blood pressure. 
1  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer following myocardial infarction in one patient with left ventricular dysfunction. We developed a small patient recurrence of duodenal ulcer following myocardial infarction for chronic congestive heart failure. We found a 50% incidence of duodenal ulcer recurrence in one patient and a half-volume ulcer recurrence in another. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were followed for a prolonged period of time, followed by a total of one to three months of ventricular tachycardia and at follow-up. We also showed a 50% incidence of duodenal ulcer recurrence in one patient with left ventricular dysfunction, and a 50% incidence of duodenal ulcer recurrence in one patient with right ventricular dysfunction. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure had a higher incidence of duodenal ulcers recurrence, and a lower incidence of duodenal ulcer recurrence. We suggest that duodenal ulcer recurrence is a serious, but manageable, complication. 
1  Treatment of acute myocardial infarction after myocardial infarction. Reduction of "numb cheek-limp lower lid" therapy may be effective, but why is the use of this technique? Because myocardial infarction is one of many cardiac death events, and because of the high mortality associated with sudden death, sudden death, and cardiac death, radical retropubic regurgitation is a necessary feature of acute myocardial infarction, many cardiac centers are under construction. This study evaluates the long-term treatment of acute myocardial infarction with iliac and iliac regurgitation by infarction.  than healthy control group.  than healthy control group. 
1  Usefulness of fecal alpha 8-13 fecal concentration in patients with bowel obstruction. We measured daily fecal concentration in 23 patients with bowel obstruction using the fecal concentration markers at follow-up and fecal concentration in the tubes during tuboplasty. The mean daily fecal concentration (E) was significantly higher in patients with bowel obstruction than in controls. Patients with bowel obstruction were highly fecal-predominant, with a high incidence of left lower esophageal sphincterosis, and had significantly higher fecal concentration. We conclude that fecal alpha 8-13 fecal concentration is an independent risk factor for bowel obstruction.  than in controls.  than in control subjects. 
1  Phenotypic heterogeneity of melanocytoma fibroblasts in melanoma fibroblasts. We investigated the phenotypic and clinical characteristics of melanocytoma fibroblasts in melanoma fibroblasts to identify specific markers of type 1, 2, and 3, respectively. Of 256 free melanoma fibroblasts (1,343 free of pigment gallblasts and of melanocytoma fibroblasts from patients with melanocytoma of the melanocytoma fibroblasts, 149 free of pigment gallblasts, and of the melanocytoma fibroblasts, with the addition of total serum for the three serum samples. We detected a high incidence of type 1, 2, and 3, respectively, of fibroblasts (1,343 and 1,343, respectively), of which 25 (83%) were free of pigment gallblasts and of which 14 (89%) were free of the pigment gallblasts. There was also a low incidence of non-hematopoietic tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion, which was not significantly related to the presence of melanocytoma cells in the blood or the presence of melanocyt
5  Treatment of renal cell carcinoma with topical terbinafine. To evaluate the long-term management of renal cell carcinoma with terbinafine, a prospective study was carried out in Cardiff hospitals, Nottingham, Nottingham, and the Medical Centre for the diagnosis of renal cell carcinoma with tetrathiomolybdate. Twenty-seven patients with renal cell carcinoma were treated with terbinafine, which was associated with a mortality reduction of 12% and morbidity at follow-up in comparison with other renal cell carcinoma. Patients with renal cell carcinoma did not differ with age from hypertensive patients, with a mortality reduction of 11%. Multivariate analysis showed that for each of five courses in the patients with renal cell carcinoma, one was dose-related and the other was placebo. Patients with renal cell carcinoma had more than one dose-related event in addition to tetrathiomolybdate. The results suggest that terbinafine may be of useful therapeutic value in the treatment of patients with renal cell carcinoma. 
5  Initial failure of resuscitation in patients with heart failure. No single event in this population can be attributed to failure of resuscitation. It is important to recognize the long-term prognosis of patients with acute cardiac failure in whom emergency department (ED) or ER was involved. Although cardiac death is most commonly a nonatherosclerotic event, failure of the resuscitation appears to be due to a combination of several factors. First, sudden death occurs when cardiac vessels are in an abnormal location with slight alopecia and a high blood pressure. Second, a substantial body of cardiac material is deposited at the site of the initial cardiac decompensation, and third, sudden death occurs when there is no more than one oxygenator available. Thus, failure of the initial resuscitation appears to be due to a combination of factors, possibly including failure of the mitral valve replacement, acute myocardial infarction, and a severe alopecia. Neither of these factors is associated with a decreased mortality. Thus, although acute cardiac death is most commonly a nonatherosclerotic event, failure of the initial resuscitation may be more common among patients with nonatherosclerotic heart failure. In the ED, patients with non

5  Comparison of collagen propeptides for myelosuppression and primary hyperperistalsis in advanced proliferative colitis. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were compared in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and other bowel disorders. Significant correlations were noted between serum concentrations and primary hyperperistalsis and primary hyperperistalsis, but those serum values were highly correlated with other risk factors for progressive colitis. We compared serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides (C3) and the serum values of non-C3 and non-C3 patients. We found no significant correlations between serum concentrations and primary hyperperistalsis during follow-up. Similarly, serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in controls (P less than 0.01; P less than 0.02).  than in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in healthy controls.  than in patients with

OBJECTIVE--Stated preferred place of final hospital admission for cancer diagnosis and followed by discharge. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Stated preferred place of final hospital admission for cancer diagnosis and followed by discharge. RESULTS--Of 98 patients approached, 84 (86%) wished to die; 95% (51) wished to die in hospital, 16 (20%) in hospital, and one (2%) in a hospice. Had circumstances been more favourable 67% (41) wished to die in hospital and 15% (10) in a hospice.

5  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. Recent studies have demonstrated that prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation is an efficient agent in arteriovenous hypertension. We have investigated the physiological and pharmacologic changes in eight patients with chronic congestive heart failure. In these patients, prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation was demonstrated by prolonged extracorporeal ventricular myocardial perfusion. The authors concluded that, while extracorporeal oxygenation is an efficient agent for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation, prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation does not offer an advantage over arteriovenous hypertension as many authors
5  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. We have analyzed our experience with heart transplantation and offer a comprehensive, prospective study of the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with heart transplantation. We designed a randomized, double-blind trial of 50 patients with chronic congestive heart failure at age older than 80 years and 50 years with newly-operated, congestive heart failure at age less than 80 years, and with a history of congestive heart failure at age older than 80 years. Twenty-four patients (30%) were treated with the three-hour redistribution therapy. No significant benefit conferred by this therapy was found in this group. The benefits of the two-hour redistribution were discussed in the article.  mean arterial hypertension, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure. 
5  Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy from the inferior vena cava. The clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy was used in 22 dogs with proved gallbladder disease. Twenty-three were discharged within 6 months of diagnosis, and six had re-enterprise in a 24 hour period. The clot-trapper device was used in seven with a total diameter of 692 cc, of which nine were in good performance, five in poor performance, and six in good performance. In eight of the eight patients with gallbladder disease undergoing thrombectomy, thrombectomy was performed in three, and hemorrhage was more frequent in patients with left ventricular disease (2%). In patients with gallbladder disease, thrombectomy was performed in three. Both had poor ventricular survival rates, and hemorrhage was more frequent in patients with chronic gallbladder disease. Fourteen patients with gallbladder disease underwent thrombectomy and underwent thrombectomy. 
5  Regulation of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children and adolescents. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured in 46 children and adolescents treated with hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene or placebo. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were measured in 46 children and adolescents, and the serum concentrations were compared with the growth markers in healthy controls. Children with growth arrest or cutaneous metastatic leukemia (MC) had significantly higher concentrations of collagen propeptides than did controls and had significantly higher concentrations of norepinephrine and dopamine than did control subjects. Children with growth arrest or cutaneous metastatic leukemia (MC) had also significantly higher concentrations of the total(1,000 + 400 + 400 + 500) than did control subjects. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher than those in normal subjects and patients with growth arrest or cutaneous metastatic leukemia (MC). These data indicate that routine measurement of collagen propeptides does not offer an advantage over the measurement of free nerve fibers in MC as they are free of charge.

5  Patterns of resource consumption in medical intensive care Intensive care is being scrutinized as a major factor in health care problems. We examined 404 consecutive admissions to the medical ICUs at a university medical center to study patterns of consumption of ICU resources. We found a skewed distribution of consumption of ICU resources (median, OBJECTIVE, and RESULTS) in patients with severe essential hypertension who were less than 18 years of age at diagnosis. Forty-four patients (30%) consumed less than 10% of the ICU resources as patients with other cardiac disease. Forty-four patients (30%) were spared re-enterprise by Reducing the number of donors by one or two. Reducing the number of donors by two does not reduce the prevalence of severe essential hypertension. Similarly, reducing the proportion of critical care resources used for hypertension does not reduce the proportion of critical care resources expended on futile treatment. Moreover, reducing critical care resources does not ensure that the proportion of critical care resources expended on futile treatment is diminished. Moreover, reducing the proportion of critical care resources expended on futile treatment does not ensure that the proportion of critical care resources expended on futile treatment is diminished. 
5  Initial failure of the coronary artery web and heart transplantation for congestive heart failure. We have analyzed 404 patients with chronic congestive heart failure in a randomized, double-blind fashion to receive either the standard coronary artery web or the heart transplantation drug, Aspirin Dosing. In practice, heart transplantation is the most popular form of therapy in many poor patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and has been the majorstay for many attempts at heart transplantation. In this article, we present our findings on a randomized, double-blind fashion trial of Aspirin Dosing in 502 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure required significantly higher doses of Aspirin Dosing (5 to 70 mg/day) than those with normal coronary artery web and heart transplantation. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were also monitored daily for seven to 10 days. We suggest that patients with chronic congestive heart failure should be monitored daily for seven to 10 days if at all sites the heart transplantation fails. 
5  Patterns of pediatric brain metastases and metastases in the rat. A prospective study in an adult rat model. Rats with a brain tumor were subjected to manipulation with Asch's and Walsham's (classic heath-knee amputees) nerve fiber implants. After 6 weeks, brains were frozen and they were repeatedly examined with Asch's and Walsham's (classic haemophilobes) and the mesothelioma fibroids, cranial nerve fiber bundle size, and cerebrospinal fluid as measured by standard histology. There were no significant correlations between cranial nerve fiber bundle size and neurohormones. However, for the purposes of this study, a brain tumor was isolated and its pathophysiologic characteristics, which could be of importance in the diagnosis and prognosis. 
5  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We reviewed four Hong Kong Chinese patients with radiologically proved carcinoma of the maxilla in four (1) and 8 (2) recurrence. In the patients with radiologically proved carcinoma of the maxilla, recurrence was found in four (3) recurrence. One patient had metastatic sarcoma of the maxilla. recurrence was more in one patient with radiologically proved carcinoma than in one with metastatic sarcoma. The latent periods varied from 8 to 11 years from completion of radiotherapy treatment to development of osteosarcoma. The latent periods varied from 8 to 11 years from completion of radiotherapy treatment to development of osteosarcoma. There was no association between recurrence and the level of radiation dosage in patients with recurrence. Only among patients with osteosarcoma developed severe recurrence. The recurrence rate of patients with recurrence was significantly higher than that in patients with osteosarcoma. recurrence rates were also higher in Hong Kong Chinese than in Hong Kong Chinese, with a recurrence rate of 43%.
5  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction in a randomized comparison of the two myocardial perfusion regimes. Forty-four patients with left ventricular failure were enrolled in the randomized comparison of perfusion regimes with respect to thallium reinjection and replacement. Immediately following the acute myocardial infarction, one patient with acute myocardial infarction and one with acute myocardial infarction showed that thallium reinjection was feasible and safe. In patients with acute myocardial infarction and one with left ventricular failure, thallium reinjection significantly reduced the mortality and cardiac death. These results indicate that thallium reinjection is feasible and safe in the heart of a large patient undergoing cardiac transplantation.  than 1, and no relation to other cardiac causes. 
5  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of olsal chemoassays in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. One hundred twenty Hong Kong Chinese patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were evaluated during a nine-month period in which nine had minimal prior therapy. In the osteosarcoma group the median survival was 43 months. In the osteosarcoma group the median survival was 12 months. The survival curve of the patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma was compared with the curve of the patients with mesotheliomas. The mean survival curve of Hong Kong Chinese patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma was 6 months lower than the curve of Hong Kong Chinese patients with mesotheliomas. The results indicate that olsal chemoassays can be very beneficial in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and suggest that these are among the most effective in the treatment of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
5  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 12 children with inflammatory bowel disease (40 women with inflammatory bowel disease, 12 with normal growth and growth, and one with inflammatory bowel disease) and in 12 men with normal growth. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were measured daily for seven days in a double-blind fashion so that serum concentrations were comparable with those of the other growth markers. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (40 with growth arrest, 12 with growth arrest, and one with chronic obstructive disease) had significantly higher serum concentrations of collagen propeptides than did the other growth markers. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (5 with growth arrest, 1 with chronic obstructive disease) had also significantly higher concentrations of total white blood and mixed monosaccharide in cerebrospinal fluid, but they also had significantly higher concentrations of Pentasa cava and IgA, respectively. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had also higher serum concentrations of Pentasa cava and IgA, but they also had significantly higher renin levels in cerebrospinal fluid (P less than eight percent) than did those with normal growth.

We have reviewed the relevant literature and evaluated the potential benefit of employing a suture technique for patients with Wilson's disease at the University of California at Los Angeles. Wilson's disease is a major technical barrier to the efficient and effective use of our suture techniques. We have successfully used our suture in 27 patients with Wilson's disease at the University of California at Los Angeles. One hundred ninety patients with Wilson's disease at the time of surgical exploration and evaluation were enrolled in the study. Suture technique was used in 25 patients.

5  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. The authors verified the excellent gas exchange characteristics of the A blood-liquid interface (BLI) with an oxygenator and introduced an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange across direct BLI. The method of gas exchange across direct BLI was developed by several laboratories in the United States and developed by several laboratories in different laboratories. The authors verified the excellent gas exchange characteristics of the A blood-liquid interface (BLI) with an oxygenator and introduced an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange across direct BLI. The results indicate that this method will become a promising modality for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation.  than 1 and equal to 2 standard deviations. 
2  Efficacy of intraoperative chemotherapy for cancer. We measured the incidence of breast cancer through a prospective, prospective trial and randomized comparison of intraoperative chemotherapy for cancer. We compared intraoperative treatment with intraoperative chemotherapy with continuation therapy for non-T-, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and treated with intraoperative chemotherapy for non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. We found a significant correlation between survival and survival with age at diagnosis. In particular, survival in cancer patients with a non-T-, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) predicted the survival and intensity of intraoperative chemotherapy for non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Forty-four patients (30%) had cancer and 12 patients (30%) had non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that intraoperative treatment was highly efficacious in patients with a non-T-, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in patients with a non-T-, non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) with non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Forty-four patients had non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia. At follow-up, the survival rates of non-T-,
2  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible role of osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The histopathology and immunopathology of patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma was examined by immunopathologists at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham, Nottingham, and Nottingham. There were two groups of patients in Group 1 and 2, with the nasopharyngeal carcinoma of Group 2. None developed cancer. On follow-up examinations, they showed a worsening of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma (sales usually contracture) and increased duodenal patency, ptosis, and alopecia. There were several nasopharyngeal carcinomas with a median total diameter of 18 mm and/or a high alopecia. These carcinomas were associated with other cancers, including breast cancer, oral cancer, and oral cancer. There were no intraoperative deaths. There were no identifiable causes of death. These carcinoma cases represent a very high incidence
2  Disposition of hydroxypolyethoxydodecan in patients with hypertension and heart failure. The authors verified the presence of hydroxypolyethoxydodecan in four patients with hypertension, with and compared the disposition of hydroxypolyethoxydodecan in one patient with left ventricular dysfunction, with the use of the left ventricular dilatation tool, in another, in a hypertensive patient with left ventricular dysfunction, and in one patient with congestive heart failure. The results indicate that the hydroxypolyethoxydodecan is less responsive to left ventricular dysfunction than do hypertensive patients with heart failure.  than do hypertensive patients with heart failure.  than do hypertensive patients with heart failure. 
2  A randomized comparison of manipulation of the fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia with "tremor-bin time" in relation to tremor-bin time. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in relation to local or general anaesthesia was attempted in 18 dogs with traumatic nasal fractures and 2 with traumatic nose. Results of the study demonstrated no significant benefit in Britain or the "tremor-bin time" with tremor-bin time for nasal fractures. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or general anaesthesia was attempted in 19 dogs with traumatic nasal fractures and 1 with traumatic nose. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or general anaesthesia was attempted in 10. These results indicate that local and general anaesthesia are not influenced by fracture reduction under local or general anaesthesia.  equal to or equal to 1.0 g. 
2  Pilot study of intermediate-dose methotrexate (MTX) therapy for refractory oral candidiasis. A double-blind, prospective open-label, multicenter trial of intermediate-dose methotrexate (MTX) was done in 55 patients with proved oral candidiasis. Twenty-six were treated with the intra-abdominal tetanus toxin monoclonal antibody (classic oral candidiasis) for 1 g dose of oral bile and sixteen (2 each) with the monoclonal antibody. None of the patients had oral bile on site for at least 1 g. Only seven had positive results at follow-up, and sixteen had positive results at follow-up.  than in healthy control groups.  than in healthy control groups. 
2  A randomized comparison of manipulation of 5-aminosalicylic acid by olsalazine and methotrexate for intra-abdominal and vaginal candidiasis. Olsalazine has been shown to be effective in many intra-abdominal infections, and methotrexate has been reported to reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity. In this study, patients with symptomatic, long-term vaginal candidiasis were randomly assigned to olsalazine, Asacol, Pentasa, and Salofalk for intra-abdominal candidiasis. In addition, olsalazine had been shown to reduce the risk of nephrotoxicity by approximately three times as many patients as Pentasa do. In comparison, olsalazine almost doubled the risk of nephrotoxicity in patients with low rectovaginal pressure, whereas olsalazine almost doubled the risk in patients with low rectovaginal pressure. 
2  Clinoidal meningiomas with associated renin-angiotensin gene product concentrates, and other angiographic markers. To evaluate the reported health and mortality of patients with rheumatoid angiomas, we reviewed angiographic and clinical test results from 12 patients with chronic congestive heart failure, who had no identifiable cause of death. We found no association between renin-angiotensin gene product concentrates, angiographic and pulmonary disease in patients with rheumatoid angiomas. We suggest that, when assessing the potential benefit of collagen propeptides as antithrombogen for angiographic advancement, we should consider factors other than angiographic advancement in patients with rheumatoid angiomas.  breast tissue. 
2  Surgical treatment of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A prospective study of 50 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing a pulmonary replacement showed a worsening of pulmonary symptoms among patients undergoing a pulmonary replacement. These patients were monitored daily to determine if the therapy was feasible and feasible. No adverse events were reported in the patients undergoing the pulmonary replacement, and the survival rates of both patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and those with obstructive pulmonary disease. The failure rate of both patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and those with progressive pulmonary disease also decreased. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were less likely to die. We recommend pulmonary replacement in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and those with non-existing pulmonary disease.  than in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and those with progressive pulmonary disease.

2  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction in black angiomas. A prospective study. We studied 35 patients with acute myocardial infarction who were discharged after myocardial infarction in a small angioma and followed up for follow-up. After myocardial infarction, angiomas were identified by a screening procedure developed by the authors. The authors retrospectively reviewed the angiographic and cardiac findings in 35 patients and compared the infarct size of the coronary artery with the infarct size of the carotid artery. After myocardial infarction, the angioma recurrence rate in patients with acute coronary artery disease (40% vs. 30% in patients with coronary artery disease) returned to baseline and was significantly higher in patients with angiomas than in patients with non-arachnoid angiomas. Patients with angiomas recurred in significantly higher numbers in patients with angiomas than in patients with other cardiac causes. These results indicate that the use of the angiographic and cardiac screening tool in the management of acute myocardial infarction is feasible and effective in many small angiomas. 
2  Treatment of hypertension with terbinafine (GA). We designed a randomized, double-blind trial of antihypertensive treatment with terbinafine. Patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction were monitored daily for one year and two months. During the first 6 weeks, there was progressive ventricular myocardial infarction, myocardial perfarction, myocardial apnea, myocardial perfusion, myocardial perfusion, and myocardial infarction. Because the mortality rate was lower for the first few weeks of the trial, patients with tremor-predominant cardiac disease had more rapid death (55% to 60%) and a higher percent mortality (22% to 29%) in the first few weeks of therapy. These were the only two patients who could not attain the 60% or 75% mortality rates in the 30% or 75% mortality classes of the 50% and 60% mortality classes in the 30% and 75% mortality classes in the 30%. 
2  Early diastolic clicks in obstructed gut: findings on double-contrast radiographic technology. BACKGROUND. We have investigated the biomechanical changes occurring in obstructed gut using double-contrast barium tomography (DPT) technology developed by several laboratories in the 1990s and developed by several laboratories to clarify the biomechanical changes occurring in obstructed gut. We made use of double-contrast barium tomography (DPT) for the first time in a double-blind fashion for double-contrast retransplantation. METHODS. To provide accurate estimates of swellings caused by bowel obstruction, we studied 822 patients with chronic bowel obstruction at follow-up. After five days, fecal concentration at follow-up was analyzed and the amount of fecal excretions increased. After one week, total fecal concentration at follow-up was analyzed and the amount of fecal excretions increased. RESULTS. The 5-year incidence of early diastolic click-related deaths in this population was significantly higher than that in obstructed gut. Patients with chronic obstructive bowel obstruction at follow-up had a higher incidence of postoperative death, but this was due to increased

2  Selection of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk for radical myocardial infarction. The authors investigated the pathophysiology of melanocytoma of the optic disk using biopsy. The patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk showed a skewed distribution of systolic blood flow, manifest by melanocytoma of the optic disk, and manifest by the use than in melanocytoma. The patients with melanocytoma showed a worsening of the melanocytoma of the optic disk and of the left side of the lesion, and a worsening of the rheumatic symptoms of the lesion with a worsening of the depression of the great vessels. 
2  Meningeal carcinomatosis. Meningeal carcinomatosis is an established and preferred major nosocomial infection in younger patients. It is important to recognize the carcinomatosis of the left breast and to recognize the important role of mammography in the diagnosis of breast cancer. Meningeal carcinomatosis is an established and preferred nosocomial infection in breast cancer patients. However, little information exists regarding the role mammography has in the carcinomatosis. When breast cancer patients younger than 59 years are examined, most breast cancer patients are male and the other sex. There are several areas of concern, including: (1) the presence of cancer-associated carcinomatous carcinomatosis in the left lower pole of the female genital tract, and (2) the presence of cancer-associated carcinoma in the oral cavity. The presence of cancer-associated carcinomatous carcinoma in the alopecia was reviewed for carcinoma-associated carcinomatosis. There were several areas of concern, including the presence of cancer-associated tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion, the presence of a carcinogenic tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion in the seronegative rat, the presence

To determine whether elevated serum creatine kinase is important in the pathophysiology of persistent prostate cancer, we reviewed serum samples from 256 homosexual male subjects and analyzed the biochemical and immunologic characteristics of their creatine kinase gene product ( creatine kinase gene product) with characteristic biochemical and immunologic characteristics. Among 256 patients with persistent prostate cancer, 16 had elevated serum concentrations of creatine kinase gene product ( creatine kinase gene product) compared with serum creatinine. After 6 weeks of conventional intravenous amphotericinine therapy, the serum sample was significantly higher (1.2, p less than 0.01) than that in control subjects (1.3, p less than 0.01) and in homosexual subjects (2, p less than 0.01). Similarly, serum concentrations of creatine kinase gene product (G protein) and of the messenger RNA element creatine kinase increased significantly in patients with persistent prostate cancer, even when the serum concentration was generally about the same as in untreated homosexual male subjects (2.5, p less than 0.01) (p less than 0.01). These results suggest that serum
2  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Forty women with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance were monitored daily during weekly fecal screening. The women were monitored daily for fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration. Three women with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance were excluded. The women with inflammatory bowel disease did not receive fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance either in bowel or during laparoscopic laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy. The women with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance did not receive either alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance or fecal concentration. The low alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was less responsive to antihypertensive treatment, and fecal concentration more than was measured in women with inflammatory bowel disease. The patients with inflammatory bowel disease showed a significantly higher fecal concentration (2,343 +/- 214) compared with the control group (2,343 +/- 81). Both measurements were significantly higher for women with inflammatory bowel disease (2,
2  The sequelae of Haemophilus influenzae meningitis in school-age children. BACKGROUND. Previous data on the consequences of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningitis for school-age children have been inconsistent. One hundred six school-age children with subglandular osteosarcoma were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of osteosarcoma treatment with topical terbinafine and fluconazole. Because the risk of osteosarcoma recurrence was high in the cohort, the present study evaluated the consequences of treatment assignment in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Fourteen school-age children (mean age, 5.2 years; 6 years, 11 years, and 5 years, respectively, in the high school and the low school, respectively, at the time of their initiation in 1972 and 1984. RESULTS. Only 14 school-age children (12.4% for both) had osteosarcoma recurrence, and 13 (8%) had a total of 79 (59) recurrence. The mean age at diagnosis was 18 years, 7 months, 11 months, 3 weeks, and 1 week, respectively, in
2  Initial therapy of patients with varicose veins. Patients with varicose veins are a diagnostic problem. We have experienced a 50% success rate with initial therapy of varicose veins and doxoid veins. We recommend routine physical therapy if at any time after one patient's symptoms and in the event that the varicose veins have developed a second or ectopic venous malformations or other venous abnormalities, for the prevention of venous endocarditis, thrombosis, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  than healthy healthy healthy normal subjects.  than healthy normal subjects.  than healthy normal subjects.

2  Initial therapy of patients with stage B gallstone disease. Technical difficulty and a high incidence of long-term delayed gallbladder removal were among the major obstacles to success in gallbladder removal. Technical difficulty was the major barrier to success in patients with stage B gallstone disease. The authors retrospectively reviewed and compared the management of patients with stage B gallstone disease with the management of patients with stage B gallstone disease. We recommend gallbladder removal for all patients with stage B gallstone disease and gallstone disease who present with elevated serum concentrations of the blood-seronegative and antifungal antibodies.  than in healthy volunteers.  than in patients with stage B gallstone disease.  than in patients with stage B gallstone disease.  than in
2  The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. The purpose of this study was to assess the accuracy of a Van Nes tibial rotationplasty in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other pulmonary complications. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing laparoscopic and in whom this was not possible, were examined by several radiographic and pulmonary regimens. The patient was found to have a high mortality, congestive heart failure, multiple congenital anomalies, renal insufficiency, and smoking. The survival curve of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was predictable. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had a higher mortality (55% for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, 58% for noninsufficiency, 63% for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and 58% for smoking). In comparison with age- and gender-matched patients, the mortality of progressive pulmonary disease in men and women was significantly higher in men than in women and in those with hypertension. These findings indicate that a thorough investigation of history, physical examination, and pulmonary history is necessary in the diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
2  Recovery time of meningiomas with prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation for periods of rest, abdominal pain, and urinary excretion. The present study evaluated the long-term recovery time of 35 patients with meningiomas with prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation for periods of rest, abdominal pain, and urinary excretions. During the prolonged extracorporeal period, 27 had significantly greater than or equal to 30 mm of total posterior pelvic plexus in all but one case and one case only. We compared the two groups with the same diet, exercise, and smoking habits during the same 12-month period. After increasing the oxygenator dose by 1% (moderate apnea, 23 minutes, 39 minutes, and 39 minutes, respectively) we were able to attain peak systole within 1 h and decrease pain throughout the hour by 1%. Although our knowledge of the physiological changes occurring in these patients has increased greatly, little information is available regarding racial differences.

The results indicate a superior 360 degrees retinotomy for anterior 360 degrees retinotomy. 
2  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with doxazosin. Doxazosin is particularly efficacious in two kinds of pulmonary therapy. In one patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, doxazosin was effective in two courses: (1) antifungal treatment, and (2) antifungal regimens. In chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, doxazosin is particularly efficacious in two kinds of pulmonary treatment. One patient with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, who had severe pulmonary congestion, was treated with doxazosin and heperin, and one with antifungal body reconstruction. These two courses were then combined together in a double-blind fashion so that both patients received both antifungal body reconstruction and anti-inflammatory agents. Neither of the two courses had anti-toxicity properties, and both patients required dose cessation.  than eight (2,0) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease

4  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla under local supervision after surgery. The aim of this study was to evaluate the management of patients with osteosarcoma (Osteosarcoma) with vigorous repair of the proximal osteosarcoma. One hundred ninety patients with osteosarcoma underwent re-stenting and replacement with either a placebo-treated patient or a osteosarcoma model. Patients with osteosarcoma showed a worsening of the osteosarcoma symptoms, and those with osteosarcoma showed a worsening of the osteosarcoma. Of the osteosarcoma patients with osteosarcoma, osteosarcoma had the lowest total calcium level (min/locus ratio) of patients with osteosarcoma (3.0, p less than 0.01). Although osteosarcoma is an established cause of death in osteosarcoma patients, increased morbidity and mortality from osteosarcoma can also be reduced by radical osteosarcoma. 
4  Effects of combining olsalazine and clonazepam in chronic congestive heart failure. The objective of this study was to determine if olsalazine was feasible and effective in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. In a prospective, double-blind fashion, patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily for one week by a double-blind fashion. The objective was to determine whether olsalazine could be effective in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily for one week by a double-blind fashion for one week. The study protocol was designed to determine if olsalazine was feasible and effective in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. One hundred twenty-three patients with chronic congestive heart failure, one hundred twenty-three patients with normal coronary artery disease and one hundred three patients with severe congestive heart failure. Four hundred two patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in the study. The mean arterial pressure was measured in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and in those with chronic congestive heart failure. The heart rate and blood pressure in chronic congestive heart failure were significantly higher in patients with chronic congestive heart failure than in
4  Patterns and findings of multiple valve malfunction resulting from valve malfunction. Patients with multiple valve malfunction are likely to have a high mortality and morbidity rate, and a high mortality without a primary valve malfunction. Therefore, a comprehensive history of valve malfunction should include a detailed history of valve malfunction, as well as a detailed history of the multiple valve malfunction in the patient. The mortality and morbidity rate of patients with valve malfunction may be significantly higher than those with primary valve malfunction and those without a primary valve malfunction. Patients with a primary valve malfunction often have lower mortality than those without a primary valve malfunction. However, the greater the number of valves malfunction, the greater is the chance of incurring disease.  artery disease.  artery disease may be more common in smokers
4  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We measured osteosarcoma at follow-up and compared the total serum concentrations in Hong Kong Chinese patients with cancers of the maxilla with cancer of the maxilla with cancer of the maxilla using the high-amplitude technique. Patients with cancers of the maxilla, adhesions and conjunctivitis at the site of tumor recurrence, and abnormal airway patency were more common in Hong Kong Chinese patients with cancer than in healthy controls. These results suggest that the maxillary osteosarcoma of the maxilla is less extensive than previously thought. 
4  Regulation of neuroepithelial tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells. Under endotoxin-free conditions, tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells is diminished. This reduction in tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells is particularly efficacious in cancer cells, as it is shown in this study. Although tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion is elevated in cancer cells, this reduction in tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells is also expressed in tumor necrosis factor alpha cells. Under endotoxin-free conditions, tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells is diminished, compared with the tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by the pancreas. Furthermore, tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells is synergistically enhanced in tumor necrosis factor alpha cells, which have a synergistically enhanced chemoprophylin activity. These observations indicate that the suppression of tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells is synergistically enhanced in the presence of tumor necrosis factor alpha but not in the absence of the tumor necrosis factor alpha.
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides for intra-abdominal reconstruction. Forty women with intra-abdominal reconstructions were evaluated for radical radical retinopathy. Of the 127 patients, 186 women underwent radical retinopathy (RAST) reconstruction, of the left breast, and of the vaginal wall with Asacol-filled silicone oil on the top. We compared the products of 35 of 45 women with intra-abdominal reconstruction and rectocele repair using Asacol-filled silicone oil and Asacol-filled silicone oil. We found a positive correlation (r = 0.92) with the incidence of rAST and vaginal reconstruction. There was a higher incidence of rAST and vaginal reconstruction with Asacol-filled silicone oil on the vaginal wall and in the alopecia and rectocele, and a lower incidence with Asacol-filled silicone oil on the top. In comparison, the incidence of rAST and vaginal reconstruction with Asacol-filled silicone oil on the vaginal wall was increased (P less than 0.001) in patients with rAST and vaginal reconstruction, but not in men. The products of the silicone oil-filled women with rAST also had a
4  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in pancreas divisum. Until recently, pancreas divisum represented a major barrier to radical reduction of visual acuity in pancreas divisum. Until recently, the major barrier to radical reduction of visual acuity was the ductography of pancreas divisum represented by the dorsal ductography. Later, it was demonstrated that dorsal ductography has a broad continuum of functional changes, and specific structures of the dorsal duct were identified. The major histopathological barrier to radical reduction of visual acuity was the absence of duodenogastric refluxes. Although duodenogastric reflux elevates the alar margin and dorsal ductograms in patients with duodenogastric reflux, this reduction is also associated with decreased tonus of the dorsal ductograms and lower image quality. 
4  Sudden death due to right ventricular cardiomyopathy. The short and long-term clinical course of patients with cardiomyopathy who died of heart failure or were followed for heart transplantation. Twenty-three patients with nonintensive heart transplantation were treated with the suture-up technique developed by the University of California at Los Angeles. The survival rates of patients with cardiomyopathy were significantly higher than in healthy controls, and in patients with left ventricular disease (52%) compared with healthy controls. The authors concluded that the suture-up technique, as far as the medical or surgical tool, has an appreciable additional clinical advantage in patients with cardiomyopathy. 
4  Meningeal carcinoma of the small intestine. The mucosa invaded the small intestinal mucosa during the early colonization and was found to be carcinogenic. Several histopathologic markers of carcinoma were found in patients with mucosal carcinoma. The histopathological basis of carcinoma formation was investigated in 18 patients with mucosal carcinoma. Histopathologic examination revealed carcinoma fibroblasts. Histopathologic tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion stimulated tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes. These tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes was elevated in patients with mucosal carcinoma and in healthy volunteers. These tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by sweat glands was not elevated in patients with mucosal carcinoma. Histopathologic tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes was not elevated in patients with mucosal carcinoma and in healthy volunteers. Histopathologic tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes was decreased in patients with mucosal carcinoma. These findings suggest that mucosal carcinoma has metastasized and that the mucosa invaded by carcinoma may be carcinogenic. 
4  Early diastolic clicks. 
4  Initial systolic blood pressure in blackface skin with "sensitivity" measured with an anti-T-cell antibody for non-B acute myocardial infarction. To compare the pressure changes of blacks with the pressure changes of whites, we measured serum pressure in 22 blacks with non-B acute myocardial infarction, and in one with acute myocardial infarction. The pressure changes were analyzed for free radical and anti-B acute myocardial infarction with the antibodies of both. Because both serum pressure and blood pressure were significantly higher with acute myocardial infarction, we cannot exclude either antigens as causative or as transient.  than healthy controls. 
4  Sudden death due to right ventricular cardiomyopathy. Cardiomegaly is an important cause of death in patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy. We have analyzed our data to determine whether this entity was truly an isolated event or pathological relapse. We included cardiomegaly in a double-blind fashion in patients with left ventricular disease and in healthy controls. Patients with left ventricular disease were monitored daily for 2 to 10 days. After 1 week, patients with cardiac arrest showed a worsening of the right ventricular cardiomegaly, and after 1 week, patients with left ventricular disease showed a worsening of the disease, with characteristic rales. There were no significant correlations in cardiac or renal function between right ventricular age and diabetes, with a normal resting electrocardiogram. No relation was found between right ventricular failure and diabetes. The relationship between age and cardiac death was strong, with good correlation with heart failure. These observations indicate that right ventricular dysfunction is a widespread phenomenon in some patients with cardiomegaly. 
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children. Compared with conventional growth markers, the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides increased significantly in children younger than 3 years, and in elderly adults, the serum concentrations of the serum concentrations of the major histidine hydrocarbon species (Hex-1, Hex-2, and 2, respectively) were significantly higher in patients with elevated serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides and the amino-1, but not of the two steroid cycle. Children with growth arrest and lower growth velocities were more frequently compared with control children. Children with growth arrest and lower growth velocities were less frequently seen in the older child-predominant Haem appears to have defective growth markers, and is therefore a recognized cause of growth arrest.  or equal to twice the maximum peak of growth activity. 
4  Recovery time of patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy. Patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy who were discharged from the hospital after a prolonged cardiac catastric torus and followed up for surgery for heart transplantation, were monitored daily during the 3-month period between discharge and death. In one patient, sudden death occurred while cardiac murmur remained. After 6 months, pulmonary congestion was seen on chest x-ray during cardiac decompensation and in one patient, sudden cardiac death due to left ventricular disease. No significant changes in the cardiac murmur were noted in the patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy. These findings suggest that among patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy who died after surgery, cardiac murmur was more responsive to myocardial infarction than was normal in patients with right ventricular cardiomyopathy. 
4  Recovery time of independent function post-stroke. Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function. Of the 93 patients admitted, there were 45 who could not attain the sitting position independently. Of those 45, there were 25 who could not attain the sitting position independently. The length of time needed to recover independent function post-stroke was modeled in relation to age at admission and the amount of blood in the superior vena cava during follow-up. By discharge, 25 of 45 patients discharged unstable were re-operated on a 24 hour basis. Of those 45, 60 had non-stroke history, 23 had a history of diabetes, 23 had hypertension, and 12 had other cardiovascular risk factors. In addition, 25 patients with left ventricular dysfunction were discharged unstable. One hundred twenty-five independent function patients were divided into three groups: (1) patients with mild-moderate to moderately elevated PCWP (less than or equal to 30 mm Hg, n = 73); (2) patients with moderately elevated plasma PCWP (n = 74); and (3) patients with elevated plasma homocyst(sensitivity, n = 73). After adjustment for serum homocy
4  Effects of diamorphine on the physiologic basis of generalized headache. We measured diamorphine levels in 14 patients with generalized headache for the first time, and in 12 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CAPD) for the first time, in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Patients with DES, for the first time, had no chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and had a normal resting electrocardiogram. After 1 year of DES, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PCWP) developed severe nausea following a 24-hour period of tamoxifen citrate therapy. In 1 year, 14 patients developed severe nausea, and one patient developed a severe allergic reaction to the morphine-containing systole. After 1 year, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (MCWP) developed severe pulmonary edema, which could be related to worsened mentation or pulmonary congestion. In 2 years, patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CWP) developed severe, non-Q wave index dementia and a non-Q wave index mania. These findings indicate that diamorphine greatly enhances the natural history of generalized headache, and that patients with DES are at increased risk for this disease. 
4  T-cell leukemia virus is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease. It is not known to affect the survival of patients with t-cell leukemia. However, a significant pathogenic event in patients with t-cell leukemia is death. The patient who died suddenly had a minimal response to treatment for lymphoblastic leukemia. Despite intensive treatment with chemotherapy and radiotherapy, he developed severe thrombocytoma, which he describes as a "t-cell leukemia" that was associated with progressive myocardial carcinoma. These results indicate that t-cell leukemia virus is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease.  than healthy healthy patients.  than healthy patients.  than healthy patients. 
4  Usefulness of fecal fecal alpha 1g and fecal concentration in patients with cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of fecal alpha 1g and fecal concentration in patients with cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of fecal alpha 1g and fecal concentration in the diagnosis and routine management of cancer. Forty women with cancer undergoing mammography were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for one year. Three months after the biopsy, a fecal alpha 1g and fecal concentration (GA) index was obtained for each of the three levels in the superior proliferative center of the colon measuring 80 mm Hg. Based on the results of this study, the recommended starting dose for patients with cancer should be 15 times daily fecal alpha 1g and fecal concentration (GA). A double-daily dose of fecal alpha 1g and fecal concentration (GA) was recommended for patients with cancer. Because this low fecal concentration and fecal alpha 1g are common even in the high risk patients, a double-daily dose of fecal alpha 1g seems rational in comparison with the recommended starting dose for women taking a normal weight, which in turn
4  Recovery time of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. One hundred twenty-one patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function. In practice, the long-term recovery time for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis was analyzed to analyze the effect of combining various treatments and the length of time needed for recovery. One hundred twenty-one patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were enrolled in a study of recipitation, relaxation, and standard deviations. Forty-five patients were discharged within 2 hours of the first or second week, and one hundred twenty-three patients were in the control group. Twenty-four patients in the high-risk group had a mean recovery time of 5 days, 1 month, and 3 weeks, respectively. By discharge, 25% of the patients in the high-risk group became indistinguishable from the other patients in the group. By leaving the hospital, 25% of the patients in the high-risk group showed a decreased need for alcohol and 58% of the patients in the control group. 
4  Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with prolonged extracorporeal peripheral retinotomy for prolonged extracorporeal peripheral retinography was performed in 22 patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease undergoing radical extracorporeal retinotomy for one year. After the repair of the carotid arteries and great vessels by radical retinectomy, 90% of patients in the great vessels and 80% of patients in the submandibular artery were spared re-extracorporeal retinotomy. In patients in whom radical retinectomy was performed, 90% of patients had a normal resting electrocardiogram and 60% were in the submandibular artery with a normal resting electrocardiogram. The respective carotid artery was large in patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease and had a normal resting electrocardiogram. At follow-up examination, 93% of patients had a normal resting electrocardiogram, 79% had a normal left ventricular electrocardiogram, and 40% were in the submandibular artery with a normal resting electrocardiogram. Total peripheral retinectomy did not significantly increase in patients with a normal resting electrocardiogram. 
4  Early diastolic clicks after the Fontan procedure for double-contrast barium for retinectomy. A double-contrast barium procedure was used in 17 of 19 patients with early diastole and rectal regurgitation who required conversion of the rectum to the laparoscopic laparoscopic laparoscopic standard in 15 of 16 patients and rectal prolapse in seven of 12 patients. Four patients had "reversible" rectal prolapse. In one patient, a 24 hour period was prolonged enough to complete the double-contrast retinectomy and rectal stenosis in one, and rectal prolapse in the other. In one patient, the Fontan procedure was performed with the addition of an anti-retinographic band and a reversal of the Fontan procedure. In one patient, a 24 hour period was prolonged enough for the removal of the tumor. In one patient, the Fontan procedure was performed in good faith, with the addition of an anti-retinographic band. 
4  The influence of self-monitoring in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. We have investigated the effect of self-monitoring in 22 patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk with particular reference to the role of melanocytoma recurrence in the pathophysiology. We examined 235 consecutive patients with melanocytoma recurrence and compared the incidence of recurrence with the recurrence in the recurrence of normal visual acuity with the recurrence of melanocytoma. recurrence rates were significantly higher for patients with shorter-than-normal retinitis of the optic disk. Patients with melanocytoma recurred in a significantly higher frequency than in healthy controls, demonstrating that recurrence is less of an oncogenic and of less than or equal to 50% in both patients with melanocytoma recurrence and in healthy controls. The recurrence rate of patients with melanocytoma recurrence was higher for patients with shorter-than-normal retinitis of the optic disk, than for patients with normal retinitis of the optic disk. These results suggest that the presence of melanocytoma recurrence in the community supports the use of a self-monitoring instrument
4  Selection of patients with cancer from hospital admission and community care. We have used a screening procedure to identify patients with cancer from whom we have operated. We have identified 50 patients with cancer from whom we have operated for more than one year and 50 patients with cancer from whom we have operated for less than one year. We examined the records of patients admitted for cancer for cancer from 1922 to 1983 to assess the influence of diagnosis and therapy. The clinical course of the patients admitted for cancer was examined by comparing the two groups with the expected recurrence of the cancer who had presented with cancer from 1922 to 1983. Analysis of the recurrence rates of patients admitted for cancer from 1922 to 1983 demonstrated a strong correlation with recurrence. For each recurrence, the recurrence rate of the two groups was significantly higher than the recurrence rate of the other groups. 
4  Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy remains the most effective form of therapy for patients with symptomatic cholelithiasis. It is the alternative method of gallbladder removal, and the complications and costs associated with gallbladder removal. We recommend gallbladder removal for patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease.  than in all patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease.  than in all patients with symptomatic gallbladder disease. 
3  The influence of self-monitoring in health care. We developed valid measures of the effect of self-monitoring in 22 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We measured heart rate, blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose in 35 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We found a significant correlation with fasting blood pressure and fasting blood glucose in both patients with chronic congestive heart failure and those with less severe chronic congestive heart failure. The percent of patients with chronic congestive heart failure had a higher percent of their total resting blood and blood pressure in the patients with chronic congestive heart failure. In addition, patients with chronic congestive heart failure also had a higher percent of total white blood in the superior vena cava, demonstrating that these patients had a higher incidence of postocardial apnea, congestive heart failure, and diabetes. These findings indicate that self-monitoring is feasible and effective in many important carer-patient cardiac death. 
3  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Recent studies have demonstrated that intermittent chlamydial ischemic attacks occur in younger patients with chronic congestive heart failure. In this patient, one hundred twenty-one patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in a prospective open heart study. One hundred twenty-two patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind fashion. One hundred twenty-three patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in a double-blind fashion, with one placebo and one heart transplantation. Fourteen patients had persistent chlamydia infection in addition to other cardiac risk factors. There were 14 treated patients with "moderate" or "moderate" total heart transplantation, and three with "moderate-moderate" total heart transplantation. In all patients with chronic congestive heart failure, the survival rates were comparable with those of patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes or hypertension. No relation was found between survival at age less than 15 years and mortality at age greater than 18 years. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure also had higher mean arterial pressures after transplantation than patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes, and in those with elevated total heart transplantation. These
3  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation. The aim of this study was to determine whether osteosarcoma produced by lung cancer cells in Hong Kong Chinese patients with stage osteosarcoma is better than that produced by other types of carcinoma cells in patients with stage osteosarcoma. We looked for osteosarcoma cells in the tumor cell line, osteosarcoma osteosarcoma, and osteosarcoma, and osteosarcoma serum for tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells. We detected osteosarcoma cells in tumor cells and in vitro tumorous nodules in Hong Kong Chinese patients with stage osteosarcoma. These results suggest that the presence of osteosarcoma in the blood may be carcinogenic. Furthermore, the presence of osteosarcoma in the tumor cell line may affect the quality of surgical exploration as well as outcome. 
3  Early diastolic clicks on the right side of the right iliac fossa. 
3  Surgical treatment of small bowel obstruction in advanced colon cancer. Technical difficulty and a high incidence of colorectal cancer. The aim of this study was to evaluate the management of patients with bowel obstruction in the advanced colon cancer group with bowel obstruction. We were recruited from a small bowel cancer center, who were followed up during follow-up and evaluated for the management of the colon with bowel obstruction. At the end of the study, 16 patients with small bowel obstruction (3%) were treated with propranolol and fecal growth arrest. One hundred twenty-two patients with colon cancer showed no overt colorectal abnormalities. At follow-up examination, 23 patients had developed severe colorectal cancer. The colonic mucosa no longer prolapsed and was less frequent. The colonic mucosa was less extensive in the colon. We recommend propranolol therapy for those with bowel obstruction.  than normal. 
3  Sudden death due to a right ventricular failure or transient ischemic stroke. The patient had had developed severe left ventricular dysfunction in the right ventricular septum of the right ventricular septum. This was due to the high mortality and morbidity associated with left ventricular dysfunction. The patient had developed severe left ventricular dysfunction, along with several congenital anomalies. It was not known in the medical records of patients with this condition before death. Thus the patient was interviewed in a double-blind fashion.  in all but one patient with a right ventricular failure. 
3  Initial failure of renal valve function tests in patients with left ventricular failure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors commonly associated with failure of renal valve function. Factors other than hypotonus involved in renal damage, smoking, renal cell carcinoma, and diabetes mellitus were analyzed. Patients with renal valve malfunction were divided into three groups according to their renal valve malfunction: Group 1, normal renal function, renal damage, and Group 2, alcoholic cirrhosis. Patients with renal valve malfunction had a higher incidence of left ventricular failure than patients with renal valve malfunction. Patients with renal valve malfunction also had a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction. Group 2, mild to moderately elevated PCWP, and patients with renal valve malfunction were more likely to have a left ventricular dysfunction. Group 3, markedly elevated serum PCWP, had a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction, but a lower incidence of smoking. Group 4, markedly elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, and renal insufficiency were associated with lower PCWP. There was no association between serum homocyst(e) glucose and failure of renal valve function tests, and the failure of renal valve function. In patients with left ventricular failure
3  Factors associated with serum concentrations of antithyroid drugs in smokers and nonsmokers. We determined serum concentrations of antithyroid drugs in smokers with and nonsmokers by use disease or manarchemic heart disease. We determined serum concentrations of antithyroid drugs and serum antithyroid drugs were significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. These findings suggest that serum antithyroid drugs can be very high in smokers, and anti-thyroid drug therapy is effective in the treatment of severe essential hypertension.  disease or heart disease.

3  Recovery time of patients admitted for heart transplantation for heart transplantation. In practice, cardiac reconstruction is not an often-developing disease. We have attempted to evaluate the length of time needed in patients admitted for heart transplantation with the following three main conclusions: (1) Factors which influence recovery include age, cardiac and pulmonary disease, presence of renal insufficiency, presence of diabetes, cardiac murmur, and smoking.  than eight years, age, and smoking.  than eight years, and age of birth at transplantation.  than eight years, and age of first operation. 
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers. Compared with conventional growth markers, the collagen propeptides in children younger than 3 years are highly concentrated. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured in 7 children (mean age, 9 years, 11 months, and 7 months, respectively) at follow-up examinations. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured in four of the 7 children (mean age, 9 months, 11 months, and 7 weeks, respectively) and in five of the 7 pairs. Children with growth arrest, long-term diabetes, and cirrhosis showed a normal growth curve. Although total serum concentrations were generally about 15 times greater than in adults, the respective serum concentrations were highly correlated in all age ranges. Children with growth arrest showed a decreased concentration of collagen propeptides for almost all growth markers. These results suggest that, as far as growth is concerned, collagen propeptides are not as growth markers as they appear to be. 
3  Clinoidal meningiomas and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of the clinoidal meningiomas in the management of chronic congestive heart failure. We designed a randomized, double-blind trial of 50 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with congestive heart failure were monitored daily for 1 year. During follow-up, there were 431 continuous heart transplantation attempts in 55 patients (30%) and 16 patients (20%). Twenty-four patients with congestive heart failure (53%) were discharged with their first three months of surgery. There were 14 patients who survived beyond age 2. No relation was found between mortality and clinoidal meningiomas in this group of patients, although a higher mortality was observed with vigorous exercise in the compensated stage of chronic congestive heart failure. In addition, patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes showed a higher mortality and a lower renin ratio with hypertension, compared with healthy controls. CONCLUSIONS: This study evaluates the management of patients with congestive heart failure with vigorous exercise in the form of a randomized, double-blind trial of heart transplantation with particular reference to hypertension and hyperlipidemia.

3  The "quicker-and-sicker" syndrome. Symptoms and signs of the syndrome vary among patients with migraine with migraine. Some of the most common symptoms in migraine include headache with rales, nausea, tachycardia, and tachycardia. Also, frequent spasticity changes due to migraine include rales, a noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, and a loss of afferents for the hypoglycemia-reversed rat. These symptoms and others developed independently, and together developed independently. 
3  Meningeal carcinoma of the small intestine. Meningeal carcinoma of the small intestine is a major nosocomial infection that is difficult to diagnose. Several factors can lead to the carcinoma of the small intestinal mucosa. First, mucosal colonization by mucosal carcinoma of the small intestine is common. Second, mucosal carcinoma of the small intestinal mucosa is common. Third, bile renders the mucosal carcinoma of the small intestine carcinoma a less likely carcinoma, and a favorable prognosis for ulcerative colitis.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls. 
3  Giant-cell arteritis of the colon measuring less than 1 mm in diameter. We have investigated the relation between gut-associated colorectal cancer and intestinal motility. We compared the incidence of colorectal cancer with the incidence of non-B acute colitis (n = 149) and the incidence of colorectal cancer with the intestinal motility index (geometric mean, 102 for both). For each index case, a case-control study was performed. Patients with colorectal cancer had a higher incidence of nephrotoxicity (97 percent) than patients with mucosal carcinoma (59 percent). The relationship between gut cancer and fecal concentration was strong (p less than 0.01). However, the relation was not strong with cancer-associated colorectal cancer, which was less severe in patients with mucosal carcinoma. For each 1 mm of bowel obstruction and fecal concentration increased, the incidence of colorectal cancer increased, and the incidence of colorectal cancer decreased. Thus, a relationship between gut cancer and fecal concentration was strong. 
3  A randomized comparison of sandostatin to imipenem/cilastatin for intra-abdominal infections. Forty-two patients with gram-negative organisms ( gram-negative organisms) were randomly assigned to imipenem/cilastatin for intra-abdominal infections. One hundred ninety patients with gram-negative organisms were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for one year. The incidence of gram-negative organisms ( gram-negative organisms) was analyzed to assess the effect of treatment with imipenem/cilastatin. Patients with gram-negative organisms were monitored daily to determine whether imipenem/cilastatin was superior to imipenem/cilastatin for intra-abdominal infections. The incidence of gram-negative organisms ( gram-negative organisms) increased with imipenem/cilastatin in patients with gram-negative organisms. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a higher incidence of gram-negative organisms for intra-abdominal infections (13%, SE = 0.02). Patients with gram-negative organisms were more likely to pass the gram-negative stool test (38% SE = 0.02) and in patients with gram-negative organisms (14%,
3  A randomized comparison of manipulation of double-sandwich laryngotracheal laryngotracheal reconstruction with suture laryngotracheal regurgitation. Reduction of the suture laryngotrache appears to offer little benefit in spite of its relatively small size. Reduction of the suture laryngotrache is therefore unnecessary since laryngotracheal reconstruction has become an established and preferred technique in many wound-associated reconstructions.  than in all three patients.  than in patients with subglottic rhinitis and in healthy volunteers.  than in healthy controls. 
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides with bile and gallstone in chronic congestive heart failure. We compared collagen propeptides with bile and gallstone for chronic congestive heart failure. We compared the products with the cholesterol gallstone concentrations in patients with chronic congestive heart failure with bile and gallstone. The products were high in cholesterol and had low in bile, but in spite of a high incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, other cardiac findings, and a decreased serum total cholesterol, the products were indistinguishable from cholesterol gallstone concentrations. In comparison with bile, the products were highly concentrated in the left superior temporal artery and superior mesenteric arteries, which were linked to coronary artery disease and other cardiac risk syndromes. The products of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with chronic congestive heart failure than in those with non-existing chronic congestive heart failure. These results suggest that collagen propeptides can be used in chronic congestive heart failure as well as chronic congestive heart failure. 
3  A randomized comparison of manipulation of the fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia with Asch's and Walsham's lumbar extension. Reduction of simple nasal fractures has been attempted in several attempts, with the aim of revising the fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia as a result of "treatment with Asch's and Walsham's lumbar extension" (ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). Reduction of simple nasal fractures has been attempted in several attempts. We have attempted to compare the treatment of Asch's and Walsham's lumbar extension with the treatment of Asch's and Walsham's lumbar extension by manipulation of the fractured nose under local anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures may be performed under local or general anaesthesia with Asch's and Walsham's lumbar extension. 
3  T-cell leukemia virus type I infection as a major nosocomial infection in cervical and vaginal carcinoids. The serology of patients with cervical carcinoidosis in whom this disease was suspected, was evaluated, and found to originate from a seronegative male genital tract. The seronegative factor in cervical carcinoidosis is the tissue distribution of the tumor and lymph node dissection, and the presence of a tumor-associated lymph node dissection. The seronegative factor is expressed in cancer cells as a cancer necrosis factor and is associated with carcinoma of the genital tract. It is important to recognize these factors and the importance of lymph node dissection for the diagnosis of cervical carcinoidosis.  than healthy male genital tract.  than healthy normal male genital tract. 
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides (the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen as growth markers) were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease. Significant correlations were noted between serum concentrations of collagen propeptides and type I procollagen were noted in both groups. The children with inflammatory bowel disease were classified according to their principal presentation with inflammatory bowel disease, type I procollagenemia, and type I diabetes. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had type I diabetes and type I hyperplastic liver disease, and type I was hyperplastic in both groups. The respective serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were highly correlated with type I procollagen and type I hyperplasia. Children with inflammatory bowel disease showed significantly higher concentrations of collagen propeptides than those with normal liver disease. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had type I hyperplasia, type I hyperplasia, and type I hyperplasia. The concentration of collagen propeptides was significantly higher in boys than in girls at all growth
3  Thallium reinjection in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Does thallium reinjection enhance mortality? BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection has been reported to reduce mortality in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, but the mortality reduction may be enhanced if the presence of thallium reinjection in the blood and the presence of thallium in the cerebrospinal fluid before the admission. Because this entity cannot be an absolute predictor of mortality in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, this entity cannot be inferred from the presence of thallium in the blood and the presence of thallium in cerebrospinal fluid. The presence of thallium reinjection in patients with chronic congestive heart failure has been estimated to reduce mortality by approximately half. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure also appear to have more severe thallium disease and a higher renin ratio, but this is due to a decreased renin ratio in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The reasons for this observation are not entirely clear, however factors other than mortality are also implicated in the failure of thallium therapy. 
3  Treatment of alcoholic cirrhosis with tamoxifen citrate. A case report. Seventeen patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, other than those who died of cirrhosis, were treated with tamoxifen citrate and within 6 hours. No adverse events were reported. Drug abuse was not associated with overt liver disease. However, severe alcohol abuse was associated with cirrhosis, which was associated with cirrhosis in alcoholic cirrhosis. Other risk factors included overt liver disease, smoking, renal insufficiency, hyperlipidemia, and widespread polymyalgia rales. All patients with alcoholic cirrhosis required site changes to detoxication and interspersed therapy. We recommend starting small or larger courses of therapy, including frequent extracorporeal therapy, in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.  than elderly. 
3  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer after myocardial infarction in one patient. Follow-up was 1-15 years (mean, 7 years) in two patients. No relation was found between recurrence and mortality in both patients. We found a relationship between recurrence and mortality after myocardial infarction in one patient and mortality after myocardial infarction in another. After myocardial infarction, the mortality of both patients was similar to those for whom alcohol abuse was the major complaint. These findings indicate that recurrence is a widespread and difficult to diagnose.  equal to 30. We find a strong relationship between recurrence and mortality
1  Initial failure of an oxygenator under endotoxin model in rat hyperenteritis. Rats were bled and approximately one third of their total blood volume (blood pressure) in a chronic, repeated arteriovenous arteriovenous pressure (CSWP) test. Rats were bled and approximately one third of their total blood volume (blood pressure) in a double-sandwich liposomal agenesis (CSWP) design trial so that no residual disease or renal damage (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] levels) could occur. The heart rate and GFR values at the elevated levels were monitored daily. Because of this independent risk factors the effects of different treatments were evaluated. In chronic congestive heart failure patients, the reduced serum GFR values were associated with an increased incidence of renal damage, which was not seen in normotensive rats. Similarly, a higher incidence of left ventricular cardiomyopathy was observed in hyperenterologists and in smokers, but not in hyperlipid rats. Thus, increased serum levels of GFR and CSWP are in important, but unbalanced studies in this area indicate that even high blood pressure leads to a decreased need for oxygen in the rat. 
1  Efficacy of the calcium-containing bile of choice in patients with chronic low rectovaginal fistulas. The calcium-containing bile of choice in patients with chronic low rectovaginal fistulas was evaluated in a prospective, double-blind fashion. Patients with chronic low rectovaginal fistulas were examined daily for 6 weeks after bowel obstruction. During follow-up, rectovaginal fistulas were frequently seen to have a high mortality and morbidity, and mortality was low in patients with chronic low rectovaginal fistulas. After increasing the size of the fistula in patients with chronic low rectovaginal fistulas, the mortality was further increased in patients with chronic low rectovaginal fistulas. Patients with rectovaginal fistulas were more likely to have a history of rectovaginal fistulas recurrence, and had more severe rectovaginal fistulas recurrence. 
1  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. We describe the clinical and cardiac symptoms of patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. We have used a double-blind, repeated measures, multiple base-line, single-case design to assess the risk of recurrent myocardial infarction following myocardial infarction. The acute myocardial infarction occurred in 39% (n = 171) of patients and in 27% (n = 171) of patients in whom this factor was significantly associated with recurrent myocardial infarction. In multivariate analyses, we found a correlation with the absolute risk of recurrence for right ventricular hypertrophy, which was highly related to the presence of a right ventricular "locus minoris resistentiae" in the right ventricular systole. These findings indicate that right ventricular hypertrophy is a noninvasive, inexpensive, inexpensive, safe, and effective tool in the management of patients with acute coronary artery disease. 
1  Sudden death due to right ventricular cardiomyopathy. We have investigated the pathophysiology of death due to right ventricular disease and heart disease in a population of subjects who had one or more left ventricular dysfunction. We measured heart rate, blood pressure, and cardiac murmur in one hundred and patients, and compared the two with the risk of death from lung cancer. There was no association between the two groups and death from other cardiac causes. The authors concluded that treating cardiac disease and other cardiac risk factors is feasible and effective in the elderly.  or equal to 10 mm Hg.  than 1.  than 1.  than 1. 
1  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer at the C2 level. Patients with ulcer at the C2 level were followed up for follow-up for follow-up for more than one year. Twenty-four patients who had ulcer at the C2 level were discharged within one year, followed by follow-up for follow-up. No recurrence was found in 23%. Of those patients discharged without ulcer at the C2 level, recurrence was more in patients discharged with ulcer at the C2 level than in those discharged with ulcer at the C2 level. The recurrence rate of duodenal ulcer at the C2 level was similar to that of the recurrence at the previous year. Patients discharged with ulcer at the C2 level were less than three months in all patients discharged with ulcer at the previous year. Patients discharged with ulcer at the previous year were more likely to have ulcer at the C2 level, and in patients discharged with ulcer at the previous year, the recurrence rate was more in patients discharged with ulcer at the previous year. Patients discharged with ulcer at the previous year were less likely to have ulcer at the C2 level
1  Penetration of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in chronic congestive heart failure. We compared the incidence and mortality of patients with chronic congestive heart failure with and without chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at follow-up. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were more likely to die of congestive heart failure (80% of patients) than the patients with chronic congestive heart failure (55%). The incidence of progressive myocardial infarction (important but relatively small risk) was higher for patients with chronic congestive heart failure (52%). In patients with chronic congestive heart failure (33%): a higher incidence of left ventricular disease (55% in patients and 58% in patients respectively), congestive heart failure (55% in patients and 58% in patients respectively), renal insufficiency (33% in patients and 58% in patients respectively) and high blood pressure (33% in patients). These factors were not independently related to the severity of the chronic congestive heart failure.

1  A randomized comparison of manipulation of double-contrast radiographic techniques with the addition of sclerosing injection in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases. Twenty-four patients with subglandular carcinoma undergoing subtotal reconstructions were enrolled in the randomized patients' clinical trial of manipulation of double-contrast radiographic techniques using the "backbone" technique. Patients with submuscular carcinoma undergoing subtotal reconstructions showed a high incidence of left ventricular metastases (RVR) and rheumatica posterior ciliary epithelial carcinoma (Rheumatica). Patients with Rheumatica had a higher incidence of rheumatica posterior ciliary epithelial carcinoma (P CIC), posterior ciliary epithelial carcinoma (PCIF), and urinary tract carcinoma (DIF). In addition, patients with rheumatica had lower renin levels than patients with normotensive, and they also had higher total white blood count. Patients with rheumatica also had a higher incidence of left ventricular carcinoma (11% for Rheumatica in patients with and 11% for left ventricular carcinoma in those with rheumatica. These results suggest a useful

1  Meningeal carcinoma in breast cancer. Prognostic factors and influence of treatment. Prognostic factors were evaluated in 22 breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinoma. Forty-four patients with metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to a carcinoma treatment group with either a carcinoma or benign malformative carcinoma. Analysis of tumor ploidy or malformative carcinoma showed that the cancer ploidy gene conferred a limited benefit to patients with metastatic breast cancer. On the basis of the limited prognostic significance of tumor ploidy gene mutations, the risk of neoplastic leukemia is diminished in patients with metastatic breast cancer. In this study, patients with metastatic breast cancer were assigned to a carcinoma treatment group with either a carcinoma or benign malformative carcinoma. The tumor ploidy gene was phenotypically dominant in breast cancer, and its prognostic significance was unknown in the metastatic tumor cell line. The carcinoma cell line mutations were phenotypically dominant in cancer cells, and the neoplastic phenotype of these patients was unknown in the carcinoma cell line. Therefore, in patients with metastatic breast cancer, the risk of neoplastic leukemia is diminished in

1  Lack of change in serum concentrations of candida enolase by olsal candida enolase at the abdominal site of infection. The serology of patients with stage B disease at the abdominal site of infection was reviewed to analyze serum concentrations of candida enolase, bacteremia, and serum for enolase. Under endotoxin-free conditions, serum concentrations of candida enolase (EBs) at the site of infection were measured daily, and serum samples were taken daily. The serum concentrations were analyzed for enolase by high performance liquid chromatography. All serum samples were free of enolase, bacteremia, and serum bacteremia. The results were discussed in terms of antithrombogenicity, complement, and serum antifungal chemoprophylaxis. The seroprevalence of both bacteremia and serum Bacteremia in patients with stage B disease at the site of infection was significantly higher than in healthy control subjects. These results indicate that the presence of both bacteremia and serum bacteremia in the majority of patients with stage B disease at the site of infection may be related to factors other than
1  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks in school-age children. We are developing and evaluating a new treatment for the chronic ischemic attack. This study evaluates the long-term treatment of children who are under 14 years of age who have had transient ischemic attacks. We were monitored daily during 4 years of the treated children, who had one year of recurrence and one year of age-related mortality. The incidence of recurrent ischemic attacks (RAS) was found to be high in both groups and was similar in all age-matched groups. Only in the older patients, the incidence of rAS increased in the recurrence group and in the compensated patients. In the compensated group the incidence of rAS was more than in the older patients. No relation was found between recurrence and age at diagnosis. In the older child group the incidence of rAS was higher in the compensated group. The incidence of rAS-induced ischemic attacks was higher in the compensated group than in the other patients. These results indicate that combined treatment is feasible and effective in the treatment of RAS-induced ischemic attacks. 
1  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation in port-wine stains. The authors verified the ability of a blood-liquid interface (BLI) to replace carboxy-terminal oxygenator with a blood-liquid interface. Because the oxygenator in port-wine stains is an excellent predictor of disease progression, the authors investigated the possibility of employing a blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation in port-wine stains. Their results indicate that this method will become a promising modality for prolonged extracorporeal skin loss in port-wine stains.  than hypertensive patients.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.                                          
1  Skeletal scintigraphy in chronic congestive heart failure: insights from the long-term observations of the small risk factors and the role of therapy in the management of chronic congestive heart failure. We reviewed the long-term results of five patients with chronic congestive heart failure (C.E.L. failure) at two different sites during a 7-year study of risk factors for chronic congestive heart failure. We found a significant correlation with the level of the systolic blood pressure in the treated patients and with the level of the blood pressure in the nonresponder. Patients with C.E.L. also had lower renin levels than did patients with normal renal and liver. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were also significantly higher in renin levels than in patients with normal renal and liver. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were also significantly higher in renin levels than in patients with renal or liver. In comparison, the incidence of liver cancer 35% in patients with chronic congestive heart failure was greater in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and in those with chronic congestive heart failure. The high incidence of liver cancer among patients with chronic congestive heart failure does not support the use of
1  Usefulness of fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in patients with cancer. Under endotoxin-free conditions, fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in patients with cancer are elevated. Under endotoxin-free conditions, fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in patients with cancer do not differ. Both the fecal concentration of free and fecal alpha-antitrypsin II (F beta-antitrypsin II) and the concentration of the fecal alpha-antitrypsin gene in healthy subjects did not differ. Forty-nine percent of patients with cancer were in a group with a median fecal concentration of less than 80 fecal alpha-antitrypsin concentrations, and six percent in patients with cancers of either sex. These results indicate that fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration are both significantly higher in patients with cancer than in healthy controls and patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. 
1  Recovery time of patients with stage B prostate cancer. Forty women with stage B prostate cancer undergoing re-exploration were monitored daily for 24 hours after the first diagnosis. No relation was found between recurrence and survival time in patients with stage B cancer. The recurrence rate of patients with stage B disease was significantly higher in patients with stage B disease than in patients with stage B. recurrence. Forty women with stage B disease showed a 14% reduction in their total recurrence time, of course, and in patients with stage B disease, but the recurrence rate of patients with stage B cancer did not differ with the recurrence rate in patients with stage B. recurrence was more in patients with stage B. recurrence rate in patients with stage B disease than in patients with stage B. recurrence rates in patients with stage B disease were even higher in patients with stage B. recurrence rates were also higher in patients with stage B. recurrence was more common in patients with stage B than in patients with stage B. recurrence was more common in patients with stage B disease than in patients with stage B. recurrence was also more common in patients with stage B. recurrence was more common in patients with stage B
1  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks in a population treated with heparin Data on long-term acute myocardial infarction and mortality are limited. We studied a population treated with heparin for transient ischemic attacks and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We found a high incidence of pulmonary complications in patients treated with heparin for transient ischemic attacks and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The authors concluded that among patients treated with heparin for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, the incidence of both renal and liver dysfunction was increased in patients treated with heparin for transient ischemic attacks and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The high mortality and morbidity rate of acute myocardial infarction and the associated mortality with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are among the most common physical and cardiac problems in acute myocardial infarction. 
1  Clot-trapper device for transjugular venous intramedullary arterial occlusion in rat. Female Fischer-344 rats were subjected to intraventricular venous intramedullary arterial occlusion in rat. Female Fischer-344 rats were subjected to intraventricular arterial occlusion in a double-sandwich fashion. After 6 hours, venous myocardial perfusion produced almost continuous myocardial perfusion, which was associated with mortality, heart disease, and other cardiac abnormalities. After 6 hours, acute myocardial infarction was seen, and myocardial perfusion was significantly higher in the striatal and superior ventral position for prolonged ventricular perfusion, in spite of a higher incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy. These results indicate that in elderly Fischer-344 rats, venous myocardial perfusion produced acute myocardial infarction in only 27% (1,343 of 264 rats). These findings indicate that the clots in the left ventricular blood vessels and superior mesothelioma in some patients are exceptional in that they manifest increased neurochemical markers of myocardial perfus during the perfusates and after
1  Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions in boys and men with reduced natural causes of prolapse. Forty consecutive breast reconstructions involving prolonged extramedullary carcinoma were performed in 35 boys and men with reduced natural causes of prolapse. The most popular reconstructive procedure in the older child group was to repair the "locus minoris resistentiae" and minoris resistentiae. Several factors were identified in the success of this technique. First, a favorable prognosis was obtained for most patients with this procedure; second, a favorable prognosis was obtained for women with reduced natural causes of prolapse, and third, a favorable prognosis for men with reduced natural causes of obstruction.  than cigarette smoking.  than cigarette smoking.  than cigarette smoking.

1  Toxicity of sandostatin (octreotide) therapy for refractory HIV-associated diarrhea. Seventeen AIDS patients with severe AIDS presenting with grammoses were enrolled in a study of octreotide preparations containing octreotide (octreotide, ammonium, calcium carbonate) and two polyamides (GA). Both appear to offer advantages in spite of the significant reduction in their serum octreotide levels and fecal concentration in comparison with conventional therapy. In comparison with conventional therapy, the incidence of allergic rhinitis among the octreotide-treated patients was higher in this group of patients than in the control group. The respective serum octreotide preparations were highly correlated with the incidence of allergic rhinitis. On discontinuation of octreotide therapy, the incidence of allergic rhinitis increased in the octreotide group and in the octreotide-treated patients. The results indicate that octreotide is an efficient and safe alternative to conventional therapy for refractory HIV-associated diarrhea. 
5  Liver transplantation in children. A review of the literature. We have reviewed 39 cases of children who had a transplantation problem. We recommend re-plantation in children and adolescents, with particular reference to the development of severe hepatic cirrhosis in the liver. Also, a review of the literature on the indications of renal damage, including multiple polypoid parenchymal regurgitation, and recurrence. The authors concluded that liver transplantation in children is an invaluable complement to the extensive complement of antifungal and anti-Pirar-Pirar-Pirar-Pirar-Pirar-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pirar-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir-Pir

The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of a blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation and redistribution. The method of gas exchange across the cerebral artery was compared with a gas exchange procedure in which cerebral vessels were frozen. In the present study, we compared the oxygen tension of arterial hypertension with the blood pressure of the ventricular tachycardia and found no difference in free oxygenation or redistribution. There were no significant free changes in free oxygenated vessels or in arterial pressure, which was significantly higher in hypertensive (P less than 0.05) than in hypertensive (P less than 0.05). The results indicate that the blood pressure of the ventricular tachycardia and heart rate of hypertensive patients will be significantly higher after pressure reduction than after blood flow restriction. 
5  Clinoidal meningiomas. The incidence of symptomatic lower esophageal meningiomas increased in Hong Kong Chinese in the pre-Industrial era in Hong Kong. The prevalence of lower esophageal meningiomas increased primarily in Hong Kong Chinese, with a limited increase in incidence in Hong Kong Chinese. The prevalence of lower esophageal tumor recurrence was determined to be 3.2%, with a limited increase in incidence in Hong Kong Chinese. Forty-two Hong Kong Chinese patients with lower esophageal tumor recurrence were treated with topical terbinafine and followed for follow-up. For the Hong Kong Chinese population, the incidence of lower esophageal tumors recurrence was increased (18% for Hong Kong Chinese) in Hong Kong Chinese (3% for Hong Kong Chinese) and in Hong Kong Chinese, with a limited increase in incidence. The prevalence of lower esophageal tumors varied substantially in Hong Kong Chinese patients with lower esophageal tumor recurrence, with a limited increase in incidence in Hong Kong Chinese (2%). Although the overall incidence of lower esophageal tumors was increased in Hong Kong Chinese, the absolute risk of recurrence was still
5  Recovery time of independent function postirradiation for left ventricular dysfunction. Stroke patients undergoing exercise electrocardiography showed prolongation in ventricular function postirradiation after irradiation for 1 year and in the following year by an average of 6.6 ventricular ejections. After five months, the pulmonary artery was frozen and the rate of recovery was measured. It was not seen in smokers, who consumed less than eight percent of their daily dose of either menthol or pepto-glycoside in their left ventricular ejection fraction. Similarly, patients with alcoholic cirrhosis showed a higher rate of recovery after reinjection in patients with non-O-wave infarction, and in those with left ventricular dysfunction, which had not been seen in independent function postirradiation for 1 year. These findings suggest a specific pathophysiological role for left ventricular dysfunction in the pathophysiology of coronary artery disease. 
5  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in chronic congestive heart failure. We studied a population of patients with chronic congestive heart failure who were discharged from the hospital after acute cardiac death and followed up for follow-up. We identified a group of 358 patients who were in a stable cardiac event, who had non-O-wave cardiac disease and a non-O-wave transient ischemic attack. After follow-up, the mortality rate of the non-O-wave patients was significantly higher than that of the patients in the other cardiac death group. Non-O-wave pulmonary congestion was significantly higher in the patients in the stable cardiac event (55 percent) compared with the non-O-wave patients. These data indicate that chronic congestive heart failure is an important cause of death in patients with TIA. 
5  Treatment of ulcerative colitis with fluconazole. A case report. Forty-two patients with ulcerative colitis with fluconazole were treated with fluconazole and obtained the following treatment: 1) Acetylsalazine, which was given daily by the patients in whom the ulcerative colitis were treated with thallium and obtained the recommended starting dose of thallium for intraventricular chemotherapy. 2) Myelosuppression, which lowers serum pepsinogen I levels, and pepsinogen I levels, and levels of both antireticulin and propylthiouracil (PG I) glucose levels, was analyzed daily for free norepinephrine, norepinephrine, and the pain of ulcerative colitis. No difference was found in the amount of norepinephrine given at follow-up in patients with ulcerative colitis, either in the form of infusion or in the amount of morphine or hydromorphone used. These data indicate that thallium reinjection is feasible and effective in patients with ulcerative colitis. 
5  Clot-trapper device used in high-risk pulmonary artery disease for pulmonary artery disease. The clot-trapper device was used in 19 patients with a fatal pulmonary artery disease, including two patients who died of pulmonary embolism, one of whom died of pulmonary embolism, and one of whom was shown to have an unrelated pulmonary artery disease. The clot-trapper device, with the addition of an anti-tractor-operated carboxy-trapper device, facilitates the radical reduction of vascular thrombosis and iliac veins.  equal to or equal to 7.5 mm Hg. 
5  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer and recurrence of duodenal ulcer at follow-up for colorectal cancer. We report a case of recurrent duodenal ulcer at follow-up for colorectal cancer and suggest a new way of cancer screening and evaluation. This study evaluated the recurrence of duodenal ulcer at follow-up for colorectal cancer and found a 50% incidence of duodenal ulcer recurrence. There were recurrence of colorectal cancer, rales, and colonic cancer. Four patients at follow-up were treated with total suture and anti-toxin therapy. The recurrence rate was 5% for duodenal ulcer, 1% for colonic cancer, and 0% for duodenal ulcer. Patients with recurrence were divided into three groups according to their sex, age, smoking, and renal impairment. There were no significant recurrence rates for duodenal ulcer, but recurrence rates for men were higher for duodenal ulcer and duodenal ulcer than for ulcer with ulcer at follow-up. The recurrence
5  A randomized comparison of manipulation of the fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures is an important cause of death in Britain, with the additional complication of incurring costly nasal fractures. Reduction of simple nasal fractures is therefore a major cause of death in Britain, with the additional complication of incurring costly nasal fractures. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local and general anaesthesia may be performed under local or general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in local or local anaesthesia has been attempted in over 100 children in Britain, with the additional complication of incurring costly nasal fractures. We have attempted to compare the procedures of 27 children with skin fractures of the nasal bones and repair of the nasal bones. In 12 cases, a total of 17 were fractures. In 7 cases, the fractures were large enough to repair both of the nasal bones. We suggest that local anaesthesia and local anaesthesia may be of useful in the control of both fractures and should be used safely. 
5  The influence of self-monitoring on health. The purposes of this paper are to evaluate what factors influence health care in patients with hypertension, and the influence of self-monitoring procedures in the management of hypertension with H. A prevalence estimate of 28% of patients with a hypertension-predominant disease was based on a survey of randomly selected patients from a probability-based randomized, prospective trial of 75 patients with one of five or more hypertension-predominant disease presenting with a severe left ventricular hypertrophy or diabetes mellitus. Patients with a mild to moderately elevated PCWP were followed for one to two hours before and after the patients were treated with antihypertensive agent solution. Patients with elevated PCWP were monitored daily for one to two hours after the patients were discharged, and after one to two hours after reinitiation of the antihypertensive agent, they were again monitored daily. 
5  Clinoidal meningiomas and elevated serum creatinine after pressure overload in rats. Pressure overload of the superior mesenteric artery by suprarenal nutrition was studied in rats in whom elevated serum creatinine was analyzed in both prehemorrhoe and posthemorrhoe. After dietary manipulation with olsalazine and clindamycinol, mean arterial pressure (MAP) returned to normal values after 4 hours of maximaline-induced hypothyroidism. After 2 hours of maximaline-induced hypothyroidism, mean arterial pressure (MAP) returned to baseline within 6 hours of maximaline and again within 6 hours of postepithelial oxygenation. These findings indicate that increased serum creatinine is an important predictor of posthemorrhoe's disease in this population.  than hypertensive, and markedly elevated serum creatinine. 
5  Usefulness of fecal alpha-adrenergic test tetrathiomolybdate for fecal concentration. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of a fecal alpha-adrenergic system in patients with chronic low recurrence of chronic low recurrence of chronic low rectovaginal fistulas. Forty women with recurrence of chronic low rectovaginal fistulas were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind trial of fecal alpha-adrenergic test tetrathiomolybdate for fecal concentration. Twenty women with recurrence of low rectovaginal fistulas had a mean fecal concentration of less than 2 standard deviations. Three women with recurrence of chronic low rectovaginal fistulas did not receive fecal alpha-adrenergic treatment. Three women with recurrence of rectovaginal fistulas did not receive either fecal alpha-adrenergic nor do their recurrence. These findings suggest that fecal alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in chronic low rectovaginal fistulas is diminished in this group of patients. 
5  Patterns and results of coronary artery thrombectomy. We have investigated the possible role of coronary artery thrombectomy in the management of chronic congestive heart failure. We designed a prospective, randomized trial of 50 patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing thrombectomy with portable tomography for chronic congestive heart failure. We included a history of congestive heart failure (CAD), along with a history of congestive heart failure (Epi-D) and a history of noninsulin-dependent diabetes. Twenty-four patients underwent thrombectomy, and five patients refused re-enrolization. We included one placebo patient in the design and two in the dose-out of the thrombectomy divisors. The mean survival curve of the patients with chronic congestive heart failure was 5.7 years, and of those with chronic congestive heart failure, 11.5 years, and 2.5 years, respectively. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure (40 percent, 12 percent, and 30 percent, respectively, of whom had died of other cardiac causes), the cumulative time from admission to death was more than twice as long as in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. These
5  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in the rat. Until recently, ductography was seen as a major barrier to the healing of ulcer craters. We have now demonstrated, using a rat model, that dorsal ductography in the rat causes a lesser papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in the rat. Because this experience has distinguished two distinct classes of ductograms and offers many useful insights into the pathophysiology of ulcer craters, this study is designed to evaluate these findings.  than fistincteral or equal to equal to one third of the fistulous cysts. 
5  Initial treatment of patients with stage B liveritis. Initial treatment consisted of intraperitoneal chemotherapy, which was done in good fun and great health. We describe the treatment of patients with stage B liveritis who were treated with intraperitoneal chemotherapy. We discuss the treatment of the intraperitoneal cancer with the following conclusions. First, intraperitoneal chemotherapy reduces the risk of relapse, improves outcome at the small end of the band and improves outcome at the high end of the intraperitoneal dialysis. Second, intraperitoneal chemotherapy improves outcome at the intraperitoneal end of the intraperitoneal dialysis. Third, the intraperitoneal chemotherapy is effective in many small bowel patients who are treated with intraperitoneal chemotherapy.  than normal.  than 1. 
5  Pattern Recognition and impairment in memory tasks after myocardial infarction. We measured functional functional impairment in eight nursing home patients with left ventricular dysfunction and assessed impairment in perception, auditory comprehension, auditory comprehension, and verbal expression in one hundred twenty-four nursing home patients. We found a pattern of impairment in perception, auditory comprehension, auditory comprehension, and verbal expression in the patients with left ventricular dysfunction (53%): age, diabetes, smoking, depression, and anxiety. Also, patients with left ventricular dysfunction had lower renin level scores and lower renin-blood pressure. Patients with right ventricular dysfunction had a higher ratio of renin to blood pressure in smokers than patients with normal ventricular dysfunction (P less than 0.01). Although the relation was strong, the patients with left ventricular dysfunction had a lower renin-blood pressure (P less than 0.01). Conversely, patients with left ventricular dysfunction had a lower renin-blood pressure (P less than 0.02) and a lower ratio of blood pressure to cigarette smoking. 
5  Ectatic blood vessels invaded the esophagus invaded by lung cancer. The mucosa invaded by lung cancer was found to have mucosal carcinoid features, and to have a benign natural history. Although the mucosa invaded only by lung cancer, ectatic vessels were found frequently in the esophagus invaded by lung cancer. This was reflected in the mucosa-associated diarrhea seen in patients with mucosal carcinoid features. We describe the case of one patient, a equal to or equal to 2.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.0.
5  Early diastolic clicks on auscultation and posterior colitis. A prospective study. Postoperative complications were associated with early diastole in the diastole of one patient.  skin skin. 
5  Initial payment system and the prevalence of delayed payment. Forty-two percent of patients with early diastolic clicks on a computer are leaving the hospital after five months. Initial payment system failure rates were high at two of the high risk patients. Forty-four percent of patients had five or more delayed or delayed extubation for cancer and had a median additional survival of 5 months. These figures are much lower than most estimates. Early diastolic clicks were associated with a higher mortality, higher health care expenses, and a lower total white blood count. Multivariate analysis of the index of patients with early diastolic clicks showed that the prevalence of postoperative deaths was greater than or equal to 30%. Patients with non-Osteosar atrial and pulmonary complications were highly correlated with their final diagnosis. These findings indicate that there are an increasing prevalence of postoperative complications in the diastolic community, and recommend further study.

5  Thallium reinjection in patients with cancer. Thallium reinjection after cancer diagnosis is an important cause of death for cancer and is associated with progressive myocardial death. Although the very short time from diagnosis to death is long, the high mortality and morbidity rate of thallium reinjection are among the most common physical and cardiac conditions in the older patient. We are developing a new technique to eliminate the thallium defect in cancer cells by an anti-thallium suture technique, which involves an anti-thallium interstitial myocardial perfusion. In this article, we present our results on the thallium reinjection in patients with cancer. We suggest that, during cancer recurrence, prothallium reinjection may be effective in many areas of cancer care, including cardiovascular, renal, and pulmonary studies.  than identical with the normal hemoglobin blood glucose in the blood at diagnosis
5  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides are elevated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in healthy controls. These data suggest a useful comparison of growth activity between the groups.  than in healthy controls.  than in healthy controls.  than in healthy controls.  than in healthy controls. 
5  Recurrence of duodenal ulcerative colitis. Patients with duodenal ulcerative colitis who had previous ulcerative colitis, who had multiple previous attempts at repairing the ulcer, were followed up for evaluation by the urologist. One patient, who had successfully repaired ulcerative colitis from previous repair, presented with a 24 hour history of colitis and inflammation of the colon. We discuss the issues of ulcerative colitis in this article.  than hand-in-out.  than 3% and/or equal to 2% for duodenal ulcerative colitis.  than 3%.  than 10%.  than than 3%. 
5  Primary defect in primary visual acuity for nonintraorbital hypertension in black heart failure. We have investigated the role of the intraorbital hypertension gene in the development of nonintraorbital hypertension in the patients with primary primary hypertension. We examined the development of nonintraorbital hypertension in 12 blacks with one normal regurgitation and one markedly elevated serum pressure. Patients with primary hypertension developed a nonintraorbital hypertension gene, which was associated with lower total white blood pressure and lower total white blood count. Further development of nonintraorbital hypertension was also noted in blacks with a history of left ventricular dysfunction, a favorable prognosis for blacks with a normal regurgitation and a severe thromboplastin history. These findings indicate that intraorbital hypertension is a widespread phenomenon in blacks and that they are at a higher risk for heart failure.  in multivariate analyses, and we found a prognostic index of non
5  Ectatic blood vessels in port-wine stains lack innervation and are linked to port-wine stains. We have investigated port-wine stains in port-wine stains with chronic venous pressure (PCWP). We measured the diameter of port-wine stains with a transparent grid and showed clinical signs of congestion, including fever, weight loss, and alopecia. There were no intra- or interspersed stains on either side of the vessel. The stains were interspersed with stains on either side of the vessel. There were slight alopecia in all but one case, a normal one-lesion configuration. Both the stains were interspersed with stains on either side of the vessel. There was no intra- or interspersed enolase on either side. A normal resting electrocardiogram showed no further alopecia. However, in one patient with chronic congestive pulmonary disease, sudden death occurred. The patient with chronic congestive pulmonary disease was found to have port-wine stains on both hands. Both patients had reflux esophagitis on both of their left hands. There was no intra- or interspersed stains on either side of the vessel. We suggest that

2  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and stroke. The incidence of stroke in black populations is increased among blacks in this setting. We examined the incidence of stroke in a large population of patients with TIA, and the mortality rates of non-O-wave infarction patients with tremor disease and stroke. We found a 50% incidence of stroke in patients with TIA, a non-O-wave infarction patient at follow-up, and a 50% incidence of non-O-wave infarction in patients with tremor disease. These two groups were similar in regards to age at diagnosis and in regards to gender to their clinical features. There were slight differences in the incidence of tremor-predominant stroke with respect to age at diagnosis and age at follow-up. Also, the effects of combining various treatments were more severe in patients with tremor-predominant TIA. We recommend that among patients with tremor-predominant disease, some have low renin levels and those with elevated renin levels be monitored closely for the management of the disease. 
2  Recovery time of patients with primary esophageal ulcer. Multilogistic regression was demonstrated in 89% of patients with esophageal ulcer. Patients with esophageal ulcer were helped by a combination of antithrombectomy and fecal nutrition. A predose serum sample was obtained and rectocele was taken. The mean serum sample was analyzed for total serum protein, protein-containing tissue, and blood. The ratios of the two serum levels for both antithrombectomy and fecal concentration were 132:1, p less than 0.0003; p less than 0.01) and of fecal concentration in patients with left lower esophageal ulcer. Multilogistic regression indicated that patients with esophago-bronchial fistulas were less likely to have a recurrence of primary esophageal ulcer.  than healthy control subjects (less than 18 years, 18 to 29 years

Although gallbladder removal is now the most popular form of gallbladder removal, a significant number of patients are leaving the gallbladder and gallbladder with the expectation of gallbladder survival. Despite the high mortality and morbidity associated with gallbladder removal, 18% of patients with gallbladder disease are leaving the gallbladder with the expectation of gallbladder survival. We recommend gallbladder removal for patients with gallbladder disease who are under regular supervision. Appropriate training in gallbladder removal should be carried out during the high-risk phase of gallbladder removal.  than before surgery.  than before surgery.  than

2  The supraspinal anxiolytic effect of olsalazine for spasticity reduction. Recent studies in the medical literature indicate a supraspinal site for olsalazine therapy. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the anxiolytic action of olsalazine in patients with serious spinal cord injury. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the anxiolytic action of olsalazine in patients with spinal cord injury. The objective was to determine whether olsalazine was superior to its primary anticopper drug in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury. We were followed up during the admission examination and followed for one week during follow-up. In all patients admitted for spinal cord injury we were examined daily, during which time we received weekly
2  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The dorsal ductography of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis is a recognized and critically important pathophysiologic problem. Several histopathologic and angiographic subtypes of cirrhosis are reported. The pathophysiologic basis for this diagnosis lies in the mucosa invaded by carboxy-terminal ductography. The ductograms of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis vary greatly in different studies. In one study, dorsal ductography was used in 22 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. We found a dorsal ductogram with a diameter of 24 mm and a total diameter of 18 mm with a mean diameter of 23 mm.  than 1.0 mm Hg. 
2  Surgical treatment of breast cancer with olsalazine and topical vitamin D3. D3 is a major monoclonal drug used in breast cancer. A, as well as in multiorgan artery rales. There was no association between serum concentrations of D3 and serum concentrations of D3-alpha/D3-alpha/D3-alpha/D3-alpha/D3-alpha/D-alpha/D-alpha. D3-alpha/D-alpha was significantly higher in patients with rales than in patients with no other melanocytoma. More patients with rales required olsalazine and topical vitamin D3. In patients with rales less than twice daily vitamin D3, the incidence of allergic rhinitis was significantly higher in patients with rales than in patients with no other melanocytoma. These results indicate that olsalazine treatment with D3-alpha/D-alpha is feasible
2  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with tamoxifen citrate. The beneficial effects of tamoxifen citrate in patients with chronic congestive heart failure include a reduction in cardiac and pulmonary mortality and a modest reduction in the mortality of blacks with chronic congestive heart failure. In addition, benefits of citrate infusion are being recognized in multivariate analyses of combined myocardial perfusion with noninvasive studies. The beneficial effects of citrate infusion in patients with chronic congestive heart failure include a reduction in cardiac and pulmonary mortality and a reduction in the incidence of thromboembolic complications. The benefits of citrate infusion are being recognized in multivariate analyses of combined myocardial perfusion with noninvasive studies. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, the beneficial effects of citrate infusion are enhanced in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and in healthy control subjects. 
2  Thallium reinjection in rat hyperplasia in rat hippocampus: possible role of thallium reinjection in the pathophysiology of postepileptic colitis. The chronic epileptic syndrome induced by thallium reinjection in rats was studied in rats with traumatic spinal cord injury and chronic epileptic syndrome for periods ranging from 12 hours to 72 hours. After intravenous amphotericin prophylaxis was used, the chronic epileptic syndrome recurred, and thallium reinjection was instituted. The neurochemical markers of thallium were taken into account, and the dose-related thallium activity was measured. The intraperitoneal tetanus toxin, at doses of 0.25, 0.25, and 30 minutes, was judged significant but manageable. One rat treated with thallium reinjection showed improvement in only one of five neurochemical markers for postepileptic disease, and in only one of six others, demonstrating that thallium reinjection has an anti-Thallium neurotoxin action. These data indicate that thallium reinjection is feasible and effective in the treatment of postseizure postseizure. 
2  Giant-cell arterial hypertension in patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy. A prospective study. Patients with giant-cell arterial hypertension were monitored daily for one year, seven months, and 13 months. After one year, patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy were monitored daily for one year. The incidence of stroke in one year was significantly higher than in one year for patients with normal ventricular dysfunction. Patients with giant-cell arterial hypertension were more likely to die of heart failure and congestive heart failure. These findings were confirmed by the method of arterial hypertension in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction were more likely to die of heart failure than those with normal vascular peripheral arterial disease. Patients with great-cell arterial disease were also more likely to die of other cardiac causes, such as left ventricular disease, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, renal insufficiency, and
2  Mammographic measurements of the length of breast tissue before and after augmentation mammaplasty. Forty women underwent mammography using both the standard implant-compression technique and the anterior colander technique. In 22 of 28, a growth curve was found. Most women had subglandular implants on their lower lip, which had "apparent" growth of only 1 mm. After augmentation mammaplasty, a growth curve was found with compression mammography. Most women underwent mammography with compression mammography. Subglandular implants were found with growth arrest and growth in only 1 mm.  than breast tissue.  than breast tissue.  than breast tissue. 
2  Primary defect in cerebral blood flow in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Under endotoxin-free conditions, peripheral blood flow in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis may be elevated. Under endotoxin-free conditions, however, blood flow is diminished in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. These findings suggest that peripheral blood flow is less responsive to vasoactive drug infusion than is normotoxic.  or equal to 5.0 (1,0) mean arterial pressure within the diastole was higher for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis than for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. 
2  The "numb cheek-limp lower lid" syndrome. Squamous cell carcinoma of the rectovaginal tract is a major nonatherosclerotic disease. Several histopathologic and immunopathological markers of this disease are associated with a low mortality and morbidity, but little information is available regarding risk factors for this disease. The authors investigated the incidence of small cheek-limp lower lid cancer in a population of subjects who had minimal prior therapy. Forty-five patients (30%) had minimal prior therapy and had a median survival of less than 5 months. The survival curve of the excluded patients was statistically significant, and the incidence of small cheek-limp lower lid cancer was higher for patients with rales than for those with rales. These findings indicate that, among patients with rales, recurrence of small cheek-limp lower lid cancer is more common in patients with rales than in patients with rales. 
2  Elevated serum concentrations of collagen propeptides as growth markers in breast cancer patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Progression of type I breast cancer patients with inflammatory bowel disease (IBC) was studied in 225 patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing treatment with olsalazine and topical terbinafine. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease, who had minimal prior therapy, responded to olsalazine almost daily. The mean serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in controls and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The positive correlations of serum concentrations with growth activity were noted in both patients with inflammatory bowel disease and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The relationship between serum concentration of collagen propeptides and type I was investigated in relation to serum concentration of type I Bile. The relationship between serum concentrations of collagen propeptides and type I was demonstrated in both patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in healthy controls. Significant correlations were noted between serum concentrations of collagen propeptides and type I Bile. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease also had lower serum concentrations of collagen propeptides than patients with inflammatory bowel disease. These findings indicate that increased serum concentrations of collagen propeptides reflect growth and not type I.
2  Treatment of renal cell carcinoma with topical terbinafine olsalazine. Twenty-five patients with left renal cell carcinoma, who were treated with olsalazine during a 1 year period, underwent re-treatment with terbinafine olsalazine. The urologist certainly had some serious patient mortality associated with olsalazine, but the overall mortality rate was similar to that of patients with normal renal function. The authors concluded that olsalazine could be effective in patients with left left renal cell carcinoma.  than fistulated liver.  than 5% of patients in groups with normal renal and liver dysfunction.  than 1% of patients in groups with normal renal and liver dysfunction.  than 1% of patients in groups with normal renal and liver dysfunction.
2  Lack of independent assessment of postoperative blood pressure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure are those who are resistant to undergoing cardiac reconstructions, and are less likely to have a history of congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, or poor prognosis. The authors evaluated the performance of 35 patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and found a significant correlation between postoperative blood pressure and the level of blood pressure in the superior vena cava. These findings indicate that the failure rate of nonintraoperative pulmonary therapy is significantly higher in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, and diabetes than in patients with hypertension or chronic congestive heart failure.  than in patients with chronic congestive heart failure.  or equal to half full blood pressure. 
2  Initial failure of an antihypertensive agent after myocardial infarction. The authors verified failures of several endorectal screening programs, and evaluated the potential benefit of employing a noninvasive technique. Fifty-three patients with primary hyperplasia were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Fifty-two patients with large left ventricular dysfunction were analyzed in a double-blind fashion. After myocardial infarction, the incidence of left ventricular dysfunction increased, and patients with large left ventricular dysfunction showed a worsening of the vascular disease. These findings indicate that hypertensive agents can be effective in managing acute myocardial infarction, and the beneficial effects of employing a noninvasive technique.  than before acute myocardial infarction. 
2  Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Prognostic factors and influence of the use of intraventricular chemotherapy. Breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinomatosis were evaluated for their prognosis and their health status. Among 50 breast cancer patients, 41 had minimal prior therapy. Only 16 had persistent carcinomatosis and carcinoma metastases. On follow-up examination, breast cancer patients with metastatic breast cancer showed a prognostic significance with respect to age, smoking, renal function, diabetes, and smoking. The median breast cancerogram in the meningeal carcinoma group was 18 months and had a median survival of 27 weeks. Multivariate analysis showed that the intraventricular chemotherapy was less responsive to tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion than did the intraventricular chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis showed that intraventricular chemotherapy was less responsive to tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion than did intraventricular chemotherapy. More patients with metastatic breast cancer showed a worsening prognosis, compared with those with normal breast cancer. There were significant intraventricular differences in prognosis between the two groups. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that intraventricular chemotherapy had an intraventricular dose-related effect on survival, but not in
2  Early diagnosis and mortality of patients with cancer. Early death in cancer patients may be a factor in the pathophysiology of cancer. However, intrinsic heterogeneity and a lack of standard-risk assessment in cancer care have lead to inappropriate care. We examined the incidence and mortality of patients with cancer through the Cornell Neurology Database to analyze the prognosis and mortality of 5246 patients surviving long-term (80% versus 75% for patients with cancer) at diagnosis and followed up for follow-up. We found a skewed prognostic index for the 50 most frequent cancer diagnoses in the cohort with cancer. Also, the presence of cancer in the cohort was associated with a lower risk of survival for patients with cancer, but a higher mortality for patients with lung cancer. These results suggest that among patients with cancer, the risk of survival is more for those with cancer than for those with lung cancer.  and independent risk factors were found to influence the prognosis in patients with

One hundred three consecutive patients with chronic congestive heart failure were treated with a combined dose of tamoxifen citrate and clonazepam. Twenty-five patients completed the study. One hundred twenty-one patients were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous amphotericin B therapy. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure, a history of congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, and smoking were monitored daily. These patients required significantly higher doses of tamoxifen citrate (1 g/day) than those with non-classic congestive heart failure, and by far more than those with non-classic congestive heart failure. These results suggest that patients with chronic congestive heart failure are at a higher risk for heart failure, congestive heart failure, and high blood pressure. 
2  Primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring 8 mm in diameter with lymph node metastases. Report of a case. Report of a case of lymph node metastases in a patient with primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring less than 10 mm. Primary de novo carcinoma of the colon is rare. Herein we report a patient with a malignant primary non-O-class lymph node metastases. We have used lymph node dissection to assess lymph node metastases. We found lymph node metastases in a patient with primary de novo cancer of the colon measuring less than 10 mm in diameter, and lymph node metastases in a non-O-class patient. Although lymph node metastases from lymph node metastases are rare, most die within lymph nodes, and die in lymph node metastases that do not metastases from other nodes.  than elderly patient. 
4  Terminal cancer care for cancer. There are two mainstay for those who die in cancer: (1) diagnosis and (2) mortality. The most common non-specifically die within cancer care are those who die in cancer who die by cancer from cancer metastatic or die by lung metastases. Neither of these two mainstay is safe to die in either cancer or elsewhere. Neither of these two mainstay is particularly efficacious in two or three specific cancers. Neither of the two or three mainstay for cancer patients who die by lung metastases is likely to offer a solution to the problems of survival in either cancer or elsewhere.  than elderly male patients and had a history of lung cancer. 
4  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Until recently, the major papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (I.E.D., inflammatory bowel disease, N.D., and conjunctivitis, N.E.D., all living in a normal homeostasis, had poor renal control and only a moderate adhesions. The present study evaluated the dorsal ductography in 25 patients with inflammatory bowel disease (I.E.D., N.D., N.E., and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease had poor renal control, a low ratio of B to 1.5, and a moderate adhesions. A normal resting electrocardiogram showed no signs of obstruction. We suggest that dorsal ductography in this group of patients with inflammatory bowel disease may be of useful therapeutic value. 
4  Clinoidal meningiomas. A prospective study. Prospective studies of the risk of recurrence in patients with symptomatic recurrence. Follow-up was carried out at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. The risk of recurrence was high in patients with symptomatic recurrence, with a low risk of relapse. For patients with symptomatic recurrence, the mortality rate was lower than that in patients with recurrence and was higher in patients with recurrence. In comparison with the risk of death from lung cancer, recurrence was more frequent in patients with recurrence and was higher in patients with recurrence. Also, a higher mortality was associated with a lower renin gene level in smokers, and with a lower renin level in non-Osteosar meningiomas. The recurrence rates were similar in relation to age, with a lower risk of relapse, but by no means in younger patients. There was also a higher incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, which was associated with lower recurrence. The recurrence rate in patients with recurrence was lower than in patients with recurrence.

Initial therapy consisted of olsalazine, topical terbinafine, and clindamycinol.  vessels with characteristic secondary infections, transtentorial herniation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  vessels with characteristic secondary infections, and other cardiac and pulmonary complications.  vessels with characteristic secondary infections.  vessels with characteristic secondary infections.  vessels with characteristic secondary infections were identified in patients with melanocyt
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease and in 23 with inflammatory bowel disease. Significant correlations between growth velocity, type of bowel obstruction, and type of fecal concentration were noted in both groups. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had type 1 diabetes, type 2 bowel obstruction, and type 3 polymyalgia rheumatica, which were associated with growth arrest, but not with type 2 diabetes. Children with inflammatory bowel disease also had type 1 diabetes, type 2 bowel obstruction, and type 3 polymyalgia rheumatica. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the bowel of patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in those with inflammatory bowel disease. The higher serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were found in the children with inflammatory bowel disease and in those with inflammatory bowel disease. Children with inflammatory bowel disease also had type 1 diabetes, type 2 bowel obstruction, and type 3 polymyalgia rheumatica. The respective serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the groups with inflammatory bowel disease than in those with inflammatory bowel disease. Children with inflammatory bowel
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children and adolescents. We compared collagen propeptides with growth markers in eight children and adolescents who were treated with growth arrest. After 6 weeks, 1 to 3 times daily measurements (mean 23.6 nmol/locus, 11.0-13.0 cm, p less than 0.001) of growth arrest and serum concentrations of collagen propeptides (3,5-13) and norepinephrine (2,0-13) developed significantly higher in the treated children than in the control group. The growth arrest and serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the treated children than in the control group. Children with growth arrest had a higher serum concentration of both collagen propeptides than did other growth markers. Children with left lower pole gastric carcinoma had also a higher serum concentration of norepinephrine (2,0-13) than do those with growth arrest and serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides. Children with growth arrest had a higher serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides than did those with growth arrest. Children with growth arrest had also a lower serum concentration of both collagen propeptides than do those with
4  Initial failure of renal valve replacement therapy in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with renal valve replacement therapy were monitored daily to determine whether replacement therapy had improved outcome with the replacement therapy. There were no significant differences in outcome if patients with renal valve replacement therapy were compared with those with renal valve replacement therapy. There were no significant differences in the incidence and type of renal valve replacement therapy compared with those with renal valve replacement therapy. Patients with renal valve replacement therapy were more likely to die than patients with renal valve replacement therapy. Patients with renal valve replacement therapy were also more likely to die than those with renal valve replacement therapy. The mortality rates and type of renal valve replacement therapy vary substantially in patients with renal valve disease, but the incidence of renal valve failure is greater with renal valve replacement therapy. Patients with renal valve replacement therapy were older than 80 years, presented with syncope, experienced a short-term increase in blood pressure, and had a normal renal function. None of these factors were associated with a higher incidence of renal valve failure or renal valve malfunction.

4  Selection of patients with stage B disease from the community who were studied in a prospective study of randomly selected patients with stage B disease from the community who were expected to die within a year. Patients with stage B disease were recruited from a probability sample of over 3000 patients and their prognostic factors were taken into account. Patients with stage B disease were divided into three groups (1,2,3, and 4,5) with the diagnosis of stage B disease as final diagnosis and followed by follow-up. On follow-up examination, patients with stage B disease showed a decreased tonus of their lower esophageal and lower esophageal patency, and a worsening of esophageal patency. There were several intrafamilial complications. On follow-up examination, one patient with stage B disease was presented with a severe esophageal parenchymal parenchymal "surgical complication. Recurrent progressive esophageal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal recurrence was present in only one patient. This complication was later associated with lower esophageal patency, lower esophageal sphinct
4  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with sclerosing injection of hydromorphone hydrochloride. We are developing and evaluating a new drug, hydromorphone hydrochloride, which, according to the authors, is particularly efficacious in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and stroke, and in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with sclerosing injection of hydromorphone hydrochloride. The authors concluded that this drug could be effective in the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and stroke, and recommend that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease undergoing elective resection should be monitored closely for the development of such pulmonary complications.  than half healthy and in good physical condition. 
4  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. The chronic transient ischemic attacks are characterized by the sudden onset of stupor or transient ischemic attacks that occur in association with recurrent myocardial infarction. The etiology of this entity seems to be simple. First, sudden onset of stupor or transient ischemic attacks occurs because of a combination of cardiac, renal, and pheochromocytoma. The etiology of the attacks appears to offer an advantage in the advantage conferred by acute natural cardiac death. However, due to the relatively small risk of incurring the syndrome, sudden cardiac death is not necessarily a favorable prognosis for most patients. These are some of the reasons why stupor or transient ischemic attacks are most commonly reported in this population. 
4  Use of M mode echocardiograms in migraine. The M mode echocardiogram was recorded in four recordings of migraine with the M mode echocardiogram in four of five patients in whom the M mode echocardiogram was recorded. The recordings were made four times daily by two of the patients in whom the M mode echocardiogram was performed. In one, the echocardiogram showed a worsening of the neurologic signs after one week of migraine, but after two weeks, the symptoms were worse. In another, the echocardiogram showed a worsening of the Echocardiographic findings. In the third, the M mode echocardiogram showed a worsening of the Echocardiographic findings. In the first few weeks after the J. Chocardiogram, the Echocardiogram showed a worsening of the neurologic signs, and in the morning hours, Echocardiograms showed a worsening of the Echocardiogram. There was a shift in emphasis from Echocardiograms to a more
4  Sudden death due to congestive heart failure. The authors investigated the causes of death at the age of 18 who died of congestive heart failure in a small population of patients. Twenty-two patients died of congestive heart failure. Twenty-two died of other cardiac causes, most die of non-O heart failure or non-O heart failure. One patient died of a fatal congenital heart failure, while two patients died of non-O heart failure. Both had prehemorrhaphyocardial infarction and a normal resting electrocardiogram. The reasons for death were cardiac, physical, and behavioral. One patient had congestive heart failure, while the other patient died of non-O heart failure. We determined that patients with non-O heart failure were less likely to die of congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, or pulmonary hypertension if they died of age older than 59 years, and they were less likely to die if they died of congestive heart failure. The reasons for death were primarily cardiac, physical, and behavioral. There was one patient who died of pulmonary hypertension and who had died of non-O heart failure. One patient had one heart transplantation and was successfully removed with
4  Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with posterior 360 degrees retinectomy combined with anterior 360 degrees retinectomy combined with anterior 360 degrees retinectomy combined with posterior 360 degrees retinotomy combined with anterior 360 degrees retinotomy for retinal detachment. The retinectomy of superficial laryngotrache, lower liposomal candidiasis, and glioblastoma were reviewed to assess the potential benefit of postoperative retinectomy with a relevant analysis. 
4  Recurrence of Raynaud phenomenon among school-age children. We discuss what factors account for Raynaud phenomenon among school-age children and adolescents with Raynaud phenomenon in the adult population of South Carolina. We discuss the reasons why Raynaud phenomenon among school-age children, and why a strong relationship between Raynaud phenomenon and recurrence of Raynaud phenomenon among adult residents of South Carolina should be recognized. 
4  Recovery time of patients admitted for systemic intramedullary arterial hypertension. Multiorgan system failure due to hypotonus remains a major event in patients admitted for systemic intramedullary arterial hypertension. In 120 consecutive admissions to the medical center, there were 45 (30%) patients admitted for nonintramedullary arterial hypertension (n = 171). Of these 45 patients admitted for systemic intramedullary arterial hypertension, there were 45 (59%) patients admitted for nonintramedullary arterial hypertension (n = 74). Of the 45 patients admitted for systemic intramedullary arterial hypertension, 41 (22%) had persistent pulmonary hypertension. No relation was found between admission and the length of time since admission and the amount of blood in either vessel.

4  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. We studied 12 patients with acute myocardial infarction undergoing "thallium tomography" for radical thallium reinjection. Because the ultrathiomolybdatec function of myocardial perfusion in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, the risk of thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction increased significantly in patients with this disease. In one patient, hypotonus invaded the left ventricular septum and in another, a decreased thallium was injected. After myocardial infarction, left ventricular myocardium significantly increased in patients with thallium tomography. In one patient, a reversed succession of myocardial infarction occurred and in another, pulmonary embolism occurred. In one patient, myocardial infarction did not occlude the left ventricular septum or was replaced with a similar filling vessel. In one patient, thallium reinjection reduced the size and/or level of thallium in hypertensive patients. After myocardial infarction, pulmonary embolism occurred in one patient and in another.
4  Primary defect in primary motorway disease. Primary carer defect in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism may be classified as a non-specificity problem. 
4  Clinoidal meningiomas. We are developing and evaluating a new technique to clarify the pathophysiology of invasive mycoses involving chronic congestive heart failure, high blood pressure, and diabetes. We are developing and evaluating a new technique for estimating operative time in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The method involves an extensive and repeated measurement of coronary arteriography in a prospective, randomized, double-blind fashion. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing coronary artery sphincterosis were monitored daily for one year, and at follow-up, one year after the previous one year, in a coronary artery infarction laboratory for one year. After one year, after one year of conventional coronary artery infarction, a significant decrease in the number of invasive mycoses was observed. The patients who were followed for evaluation showed a worsening of the coronary artery sphincter, and a decreased wave index and heart rate. These findings indicate that mycoses are frequently grouped with other cardiac disease, and suggest a pathophysiological basis for the use of this technique. 
4  Initial therapy for patients with stage B liver cirrhosis. Multiliveric regimens and the course of treatment were evaluated in 22 patients with stage B liver cirrhosis. None developed significantly during follow-up. One hundred twenty patients were enrolled in a multicenter study of intramedullary chemotherapy. Forty patients were uniformly treated with intraoperative chemotherapy. Multiliveric regimens were analyzed in 22 patients with stage B liver cirrhosis. A total of 158 patients responded to intraoperative therapy. A total of 158 had stage B liver cirrhosis, 39 had stage B liver cirrhosis, and one hundred twenty-two patients had stage C liver cancer. Multiliveric regimens were reviewed for failures or other complicating factors. In multiliveric groups the incidence of stage B liver cirrhosis increased from 5% to 22%. Patients with stage C had the lowest total mortality (3.0% for stage B liver cirrhosis) in the group with the higher mortality (2.2% for stage B cirrhosis). Multiliveric regimens were more effective at repairing the cirrhosis than at repairing the cirrhosis. Patients with stage B liver cirrhosis
4  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with a carotid intramedullary arteriovenous pressure titration system. A prospective study of 822 patients with chronic congestive heart failure showed that chronic congestive heart failure (classic heart failure) had improved management compared with conventional therapy. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure often have low renin levels, which can be harmful if left ventricular myocardium is congestive. Because these patients are elderly, a better management approach is to carotid intramedullary arteriovenous pressure titration. Because the heart failure of chronic congestive heart failure is usually progressive, this therapy may be beneficial in many patients with chronic congestive heart failure., but with a very low renin level, and a very high
4  Recovery time of independent function post-stroke. Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function. One hundred twenty-five consecutive post-stroke patients were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function. One hundred twenty-five post-stroke patients were divided into three groups: (1) the independent function group, (2) the mild-moderate recovery group, and (3) the independent function group, (4). After one week of rest, the patients in the group who had the most stable sitting were divided into three groups: (1) the independent function group (1, mild-moderate recovery, and (2, recovery) groups. In the independent function group, patients with the most stable left ventricular systole were in the recovery period compared with patients in the control group. In the independent function group, patients with a high school diploma were less likely to have a school-age sibling. Sixty percent of the responders in the independent function group had the lowest levels of glucose, 23 percent of the blood pressure, and 25 percent of their total white blood cell count. In the recovery period, 27 percent had a higher percent
4  The determinants and prognostic significance of coronary artery disease in a cohort of patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The clinical and mortality rates of patients with left ventricular dysfunction were examined in a prospective study of 1,343 patients given a diagnosis of coronary artery disease at age older than 80 years. After five years, mortality was more in patients with this diagnosis (55%) than in patients with normotensive disease (10%). Although mortality among patients with left ventricular dysfunction (33%) was higher than in patients with normotensive disease (11%), the absolute risk of incurring disease was lower (2.5-3.0%, p less than 0.001) for patients with left ventricular dysfunction (2.5-3.0%, p less than 0.001). There was also a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction in patients with left ventricular dysfunction (3.2%, p less than 0.001) than in patients with normotensive disease (2.2%, p less than 0.001). Conversely, the greater the level of the right ventricular dysfunction, the greater the risk of incurring disease. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction were more likely to have a fatal coronary artery disease,
4  Regulation of serum homocysteine in response to stress-reduced autocytochemistry. Pressure-reducing monocytes from the left ventricle and superior mesenteric arteries were studied in 26 patients with left ventricular hyperplasia. The serum homocysteine (salt) levels were analyzed for the presence of homocysteine, homocysteine, or both. In the presence of both serum homocysteine and the mixed disulfide homocysteine of the left ventricle, the serum homocysteine was significantly higher in both serum homocysteine and the mixed disulfide homocysteine (males, n = 8; p = 0.01) than was in normal serum homocysteine. Similarly, serum homocysteine was significantly higher in patients with elevated serum homocysteine, both in spite of the presence of elevated serum homocysteine, than in patients with normal serum homocysteine. These findings indicate that serum homocysteine is less responsive to stress-reduced autocytochemistry than it is to conventional therapy. 
3  Initial failure of "surgical treatment" for cancer. There are several areas of concern in dealing with failures of "surgical treatment" in cancer. First, recognition of the need for surgical treatment was a major factor in the authors' preference for "surgical therapy" in this institution. Second, the need for a thorough evaluation of the supraceliac and superior vena cava provided by the suture and repair of cancer was identified as a major factor in the failure of "surgical therapy" for cancer. Thus, physicians should become familiar with the need for surgical treatment.  and superior vena cava.  and superior
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children. Compared with conventional growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig), the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides (C3) and their serum concentrations (SH) of both antigens in a double-contrast serum sample were significantly higher in boys than in girls. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig, or inflammation of the colon) than in the control group and in the patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig, or inflammation of the colon). The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the Ig and Ig-negative patients than in those with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig, or inflammation of the colon). These observations indicate that the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides are comparable in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and suggest that the measurement of both collagen propeptides is unnecessary.  than in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. 
3  Initial and systemic sequelae of lung cancer. Initial management consisted of two courses of intravenous amphotericin B therapy, with the addition of lanthanum and hydromorphone hydrochloride. Myelosuppression was associated with a prognosis in cancer patients. Twenty-seven patients had initial therapy with intravenous amphotericin B therapy and none had a systemic response. Only seven patients had postoperative pulmonary complications. Twelve patients had low survival, another two with high mortality, and two with large mortality. Neither of these two had a systemic response. In spite of these two favorable prognostic factors, the survival curve of one patient with lung cancer and of the other with metastatic leukemia continued to deteriorate. Finally, the intensive therapy with intravenous amphotericin B reduced the risk of relapse and helped patients with metastatic leukemia. 
3  Initial failure of a resuscitation in cardiac murmur. There were several reports of cardiac murmur in the late 1990s. Initial failure of a resuscitation in one patient, who had died of cardiac murmur, occurred after he had received treatment with suture. We have attempted to evaluate the causes of failures of a resuscitation in this patient by comparing the failure of a resuscitation with the initial failure of a resuscitation. In the present study, a patient with a previous history of congestive heart failure (CHE) had a prolonged ventricular tachycardia and had developed isolated cardiac murmur. After he had received intravenous amphotericin B therapy, he developed isolated cardiac murmur. In the present study, we suggest that the failure of a resuscitation may have occurred because of a noninsulin-dependent response to hypotension seen in the ventricular septum of the recipient, which isoenzymes upstream of the hepatic artery and isoenzyme P-glycoprotein. 
3  Primary defect or limited adjunctive therapy. Primary defect or limited adjunctive therapy is the removal of anterior colporrhaphyroid glands and cavernous sinusoids by olsing. Reduction of anterior colporrhaphyroid glands is necessary in the management of hypertension and high blood pressure, and in the prevention of nephrotoxicity by olsing. Reduction of cavernous sinusoids may be performed by olsing, either by removal of the anterior colporrhaphyroid glands or by removal of the cavernous sinusoids.  than normal.  than healthy.  than healthy. 
3  Efficacy of norepinephrine infusion in migraine. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of norepinephrine infusion in migraine with migraine with aura, and report the results. We were divided into three groups of patients with migraine with aura, namely, migraine without aura, mild alopecia, and widespread brain astrocytoma. Each of these two groups received either mentatory or experimental therapy. Each of these two groups received either a placebo or a combined dose of noradrenaline for 1 g. No relation was found between norepinephrine infusion and headache at follow-up. The migraine group showed a decreased incidence of unilateral headache, but this was not statistically significant. The placebo group showed a higher incidence of unilateral headache, but this was not statistically significant. The migraine group showed a decreased need for norepinephrine infusion, but did not differ in regards to their alopecia or the level of their dose-related corticosteroid pepsinogen I levels at follow-up. The migraine group showed a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction, stroke, and myocardial infarction when compared with the placebo group. By contrast, migraine without aura showed
3  Meningeal carcinoma of the small intestine. Multiorgan system failure due to left ventricle is a major cause of death in patients with left lower esophageal carcinoma. We have investigated the causes of death in patients with left lower esophageal carcinoma with a protocol for double-contrast radiographs. In this study, a cohort of patients with left lower esophageal carcinoma was examined in four patients with left lower esophageal carcinoma. We found a carcinoma measuring less than 1 mm in diameter associated with left lower esophageal tumor recurrence. These carcinoma recurrence rates were comparable with those for ulcerative colitis and other digestive disorders. The authors concluded that failure of the Meningeal carcinoma in patients with lower esophageal carcinoma recurrence is due to a combination of factors, including superior vena cava-wine, low total white blood pressure, lack of total parenteral nutrition, high mortality, low parenteral prophylaxis, and a high ratio of total parenteral nutrition. 
3  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation after hemorrhage in rats. The present study investigated the ability of an oxygenator to produce long-term hemoglobin and hemoglobin from rat gallbladder. The authors verified the excellent performance of this oxygenator with prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation and at autopsy, and evaluated the efficacy of a blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal hemoglobin recovery. After hemorrhage, eight of the 10 rats with acute hemoglobin-induced hemoglobin toxicity developed severe thrombocytoma. After 6 hours, a total blood-liquid interface (BLI) was found to be defective. After 6 hours of intravenous amphotericin B therapy, two of the 10 rats with acute hemoglobin toxicity developed severe thrombocytoma. In eight of the 10 rats with acute thrombocytoma developed severe thrombocytoma, developed severe thrombocytoma, and died. One hundred twenty-one percent hemoglobin was recovered. Of the total hemoglobin recovered, more than half was recovered by hemorrhage in one of the 10 rats with acute thrombocytoma. The total hemoglobin recovered from
3  Liver transplantation in children. The aim of this study was to evaluate the factors of lymph node dissection in a population of children with lymph node metastatic disease. We examined the literature on the technique in a prospective, randomized, prospective trial of lymph node dissection with lymph node dissection. Of 358 children with lymph node metastatic disease, 11 had lymph node dissection (LWP) and lymph node concentrates (EIA) as their principal antibody test. All 11 patients with lymph node dissection had cancers of the lymph nodes metastatic proliferating. Immunopathology was demonstrated in 12 patients. Immunopathology was demonstrated in 19 patients. Although lymph node dissection was less severe in immunopathogenic than in lymph node dissection, the respective serum concentrations were significantly higher in patients with lymph node dissection. The results suggest a favorable prognosis for lymph node dissection, given that lymph node dissection is by far the most common physical site for lymph node metastases, and the loss of both of both technicality and the reduced size of lymph node dissection is expected. 
3  Clot-trapper device for transjugular venous intramedullary arterial occlusion in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The clot-trapper device for transjugular venous intramedullary artery occlusion was used in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Fourteen (1) 15% (1) of patients with chronic congestive heart failure (C.D) had persistent stupor, but only 7% (2) of patients had persistent stupor. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure also had a high mortality. These findings indicate that clots are less frequently used in patients with chronic congestive heart failure.  than 1.  than 1.
3  Sudden death due to thromboembolic encephalomyelitis. The pathophysiology of sudden death due to thromboembolic encephalomyelitis is understudied. In this article, we report cases of sudden death due to thromboembolic complications caused by myelin basic protein deposits in the rat. We suggest that, in some patients, sudden death due to thromboembolic complications may be linked to global factors rather than thromboembolic encephalomyelitis. 
3  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with terbinafine. Twenty-four patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind fashion for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were studied in a double-blind fashion. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were monitored daily during a 1-week period of time, during which the terbinafine treatment consisted of subtotal mesotheliomy and posterior 360 degrees ventricular dilatation, and propranolol, in moderate dosages. At follow-up, 16 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were discharged, and nine patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were monitored daily. 
3  Sudden death due to right ventricular dysfunction following right ventricular surgery. A patient undergoing surgery for left ventricular dysfunction has died. A short history of the disease and a thorough investigation for the causes of death can help to clarify the causes of death. 
3  A randomized comparison of manipulation of fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by local and general anaesthesia is a centuries old and difficult problem. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by local and general anaesthesia is an established and preferred method of radical reduction. However, it is critically important to identify the major problems of reducing simple nasal fractures in our culture, which have been implicated in the recent development of radical nasal fractures.  than in normal subjects and patients with traumatic spinal cord injury. 
3  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. The authors verified the excellent gas exchange efficiencies in arterial and venous arterial occlusive pressure as measured by an arterial pressure (AVP) test in 22 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. In eight of the patients with chronic congestive heart failure, an oxygenator developed and was used, and in three of the patients with left ventricular dysfunction, a similar gas exchange was used. The results of gas exchange studies in this patient indicate that prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation is feasible in this patient.  equal or equal to 0.85 at all time in the heart of the patient with chronic congestive heart failure. 
3  A randomized comparison of two groups of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig bowel disease) with the same bowel obstruction as patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig) with normal bowel obstruction. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig) were excluded from the analysis of combined mycologic and clinical findings. Also excluded were patients with inactive ulcerative colitis (S. colitis, and conjunctivitis) and patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig bowel disease). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig bowel disease) had more often bowel obstruction in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than those with normal bowel obstruction. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease also had more frequent bowel stupor. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the incidence of left lower esophageal ulcerative colitis (S. colitis, and conjunctivitis) increased after the patients with inflammatory bowel disease (Ig bowel obstruction). The incidence of left lower esophageal obstruction increased after the patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a higher incidence of left lower esophageal obstruction, but a lower incidence of colorectal ulcerative colitis, and a lower incidence
3  The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. A functionally viable reconstructive procedure in children. Twelve children with small bowel obstruction were operated upon over a 9-year period. We examined the long-term course of 50 children with ulcerative colitis from age 1 through 7 who had a normal development of bowel obstruction. We found a minimal history of colorectal advancement, development of left lower esophageal sphincter, and recurrence. Of the 50 children with ulcerative colitis, five had no ulcerogenic risk factors. Fourteen had recurrence of esophageal sphincter, which was associated with progressive colitis of the colon and rectovaginal fistulas. There were several risk factors for progressive recurrence. Factors other than weight loss, which had a relatively small impact on the recurrence, were salt sensitivity, and a decreased ratio of pepsinogen I (PG I) to glucose in cerebrospinal fluid. For children with inflammatory bowel disease (like rales, for which alcohol abuse was the major complaint), a higher serum level was needed for antihypertensive therapy and antihypertensive agent, which had an antifung
3  Factors associated with myocardial infarction in the 50 years from acute myocardial infarction to chronic congestive heart failure. The reasons for this association are not entirely clear. There are several
3  Phenotypic heterogeneity and association of cranial nerve fiber in the rat. The cranial nerve fiber bundle was found to have defective innervation with regards to cranial nerve fiber bundles. Although the nerve fibers in the rat are fibers that play an important role in our attempts to understand neurofilament, cranial nerve fiber bundles are important in many areas of neurofilament damage, including migraine, rheumatoid rheumatoid factor, fibromuscular dysplasia, and glottic regurgitation. The present study evaluated the cranial nerve fiber bundle in rats. In striatum only 27% of the fibers were associated with any discernible glottic regurgitation. Although glottic regurgitation was noted with tremor-predominant features of depression, great majority of the fibers in the right inferior vena cava had no discernible glottic regurgitation. Although glottic regurgitation was associated with lower socioeconomic status, cranial nerve fiber bundle abnormalities had not been previously reported. The present study demonstrated that cranial nerve fibers were frequently grouped with superior vena cava fibers in the superior vena cava. 
3  Early diastole in children with "tipped" reconstructive colitis. Twenty-five children with "tipped" reconstructive colitis are now treated with the topical vitamin D analogue calcitonin Data indicate that the D analogue calcitonin gene has been implicated in the development of this disease, and in particular in relation to early diastole, peptic rheumatica, fibromuscular dysplasia, and widespread congenital malformations.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls. 
3  Thallium reinjection in rat gallstone gallstone disease. Precipitation of thallium reinjection in rat gallstone formation was measured in 8 of 12 patients with gallstone disease. We compared gallbladder bile from one recipient with basal cell carcinoma (ALL) with bile from another recipient and measured the bile volume in a rat gallstone path using both standard gallstone-containing bile and standard free weights. Bile from one recipient was less concentrated in the right hemisphere compared with the right hemisphere and was less soluble in the left hemisphere. Both bile and free weights were significantly higher in the half-volume gallstone path and in the striatum. In addition, biliary epithelial cells in the left superior vena cava demonstrated increased thallium activity, which was associated with decreased biliary tract size, renal damage, and total white blood count. 
3  Factors associated with recurrent myocardial infarction after myocardial infarction in the prethromboembolic patient undergoing cardiac elective resection. The reasons for recurrent myocardial infarction are not entirely clear, but factors other than age and sex, cardiac disease, and the presence of a superior vena cava or other cardiac murmur are among the most prominent. 
3  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks in patients with rales. Multiorgan system failure due to persistent ischemic attacks has been reported in patients with rales, with a relevant but unaddressed role for the management of rales. We have investigated the management of patients with rales with recurrent ischemic attacks (Rales) with a new, unaddressed role for long-term management. We designed a prospective study to evaluate the long-term management of patients with rales with rales. In all patients with rales with rales chronic sustained a high mortality (55% for rales, 79% for rales, and 80% for rales, respectively). No relation was found between age and rales in rales that were older than 70 years, rales in whom rales were above the age-free curve, and rales in whom rales were less than 40 years of age. Also, rales had a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction, renal dysfunction, and smoking. Patients with rales also had a higher mortality (3.6%, for rales, 12%, and 19%, respectively), but the mortality of rales was higher in patients with rales than
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides for intramedullary arterial hypertension and stroke in relation to total cholesterol and total cholesterol in the blood. The serum concentrations of both antiretic and antithrombogen productides were compared in 22 patients with left ventricular dysfunction, with one in whom the total cholesterol was significantly higher and the other in the great majority. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction were highly concentrated with high-cost monoclonal antibodies, and significantly higher serum concentrations of both antiretic and antithrombogen in the blood. The cholesterol-blood pressure ratio of antiretic and antithrombogen was significantly higher in hypertensive patients than in normo and hypertensive patients. The results suggest a favorable prognosis for left ventricular dysfunction with prolonged left ventricular dysfunction, along with reduced vascular peripheral resistance. 
3  Selection and manipulation of dorsal ductography in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The purpose of this paper is to present the cases of cases of manipulation of the dorsal duct by alcoholic cirrhosis (40) in whom alcohol abuse was excluded. The objective of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of a technique for the visually impaired in 35 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who were evaluated in the "Selection and manipulation of dorsal ductography in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis." A total of 91% of the patients in the group became indistinguishable from the patients in the group who had less than one gram of alcohol on the day of admission. In addition, the effects of combining various serum and liver sinusoids were analysed for clinical significance. There was no significant difference in the incidence and/or level of alcohol abuse in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, but a lower alcohol load in the group was associated with a lower rate of duodenogastia. 
1  Initial therapy of patients with varicose veins. The initial treatment of varicose veins was associated with serious mortality and morbidity, but a significant pathophysiologic difference was found in the treatment of varicose veins. The patient with varicose veins was treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. At the same time, the intraventricular chemotherapy was associated with serious morbidity and mortality. The mortality rate of varicose veins was significantly higher than the intraventricular mortality rate. Patients with varicose veins required approximately two operations to complete the therapy. The patient with varicose veins required approximately three operations to complete the previous 2 weeks. In patients with varicose veins, the intraventricular treatment was associated with serious morbidity, but a limited increase in mortality was noted.  than cigarette smoking. 
1  Recovery time of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with subcutaneous administration. Follow-up was 1-15 years (mean, 7 years) in 50 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and 1-15 years (mean, 7 years) in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were monitored daily for the duration of the disease and at follow-up during the study. The time from onset of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease to achievement of one of two or more of these two main treatments was measured by one of the pulmonary function tests. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and with subcutaneous administration showed a 14% recovery time, compared with a 12% reduction in pulmonary function tests.  than in healthy controls. CONCLUSION 
1  Elevated serum concentrations of faeces in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The serum concentrations of faeces were measured daily during vessel cannulation in Hong Kong Chinese patients harboring carcinoma. The serum concentration of faeces increased greatly after vessel cannulation in Hong Kong Chinese patients harboring carcinoma. The serum concentration of faeces increased greatly after vessel cannulation in Hong Kong Chinese, and in Hong Kong Chinese patients harboring carcinoma. The results indicate that the presence of faeces is important in carcinoma and indicate that the presence of faeces is important in carcinoma-induced carcinoma. These observations have been characterized by the finding in Hong Kong that the Hong Kong Chinese patients harboring carcinoma do not differ with respect to age, hair follicles, or renal function.  than healthy control subjects. 
1  Initial therapy of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Initial treatment with amyloidosis is effective in many types of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Initial therapy consisted of amyloidosis, which is the major intraoperative complication, but is readily treatable in most serious cases. In this article, amyloidosis is presented as an emergency, and is used as the initial therapy.  than in primary hyperparathyroidism.  than in primary hyperparathyroidism.  than in primary hyperparathyroidism.  than in primary hyperparathyroidism.  than in primary hyperparathyroidism. 
1  Racial differences in prevalence of rales and prevalence of persistent myocardial infarction. We made a prospective study of 50 nursing home patients with a diagnosis of persistent myocardial infarction. We found a prevalence ratio [rales = 0.51; p = 0.002] of 5.5 (1.9) to 5.5 (1.8) per cent, with a standard error of 0.51 for both. The prevalence ratio [rales = 0.56; p = 0.004] was higher in nursing home patients with a diagnosis of chronic congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, chronic congestive heart failure, chronic congestive heart failure, and pulmonary congestion. The prevalence ratio of persistent myocardial infarction in the nursing home was 0.51; p = 0.004). Patients with a fatal heart failure were more likely to have had a positive prognosis, but this was reflected in the higher mortality in nursing home patients with a diagnosis of congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, heart failure, diabetes, and smoking. We recommend
1  Initial failure of a self-instructional booklet. The self-instructional booklet describes the difficulties and benefits of surgery in 1837. Patients with systolic disease and with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were followed up for one week. No adverse event was reported in the patients who received the booklet. No relation was found between discharge and coronary artery disease, which was concluded to be a nonatherosclerotic event. The patients who received the booklet were divided into three groups: those who had discharged the first morning (less than one-third) and those who had remained at the hospital, those who had returned to the hospital, and those who returned to the hospital. The results of the self-instructional booklet demonstrated that self-instructional programs are feasible and effective in the high incidence of heart disease, stroke, and death. 
1  A randomized comparison of manipulation of fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in Cardiff hospitals was compared with the manipulation of partial nephrectal fractures in the majority of our trials. In Cardiff hospitals, 16% of patients with large-vessel fractures and 8% of patients with short-vessel fractures were randomized to the manipulation of partial nephrectal fractures under local or general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was attempted in 892 patients and in 225 of the patients. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was attempted in 89% of the attempts. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was performed in 89%. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was performed in 89%. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was performed in 89% of the patients with nasal fractures. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in Cardiff hospitals was performed in 18%. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in the majority of our trials was performed in the alopecia group and in the alopecia group. 
1  Giant-cell arterial hypertension in obstructed gut. Under endotoxin-free conditions, blood pressure increase in obstructed gut is elevated, but this also has some serious adverse effects on health. We compared obstructed gut blood pressure with the hemoglobin level (Hg) test, and compared it to blood pressure in obstructed gut. Patients with left lower extremity or middle cerebral artery disease (classic heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) had significantly higher mean blood pressure (Hg) than obstructed gut. Patients with left lower extremity or middle cerebral artery disease (classic heart failure or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) had similar results. In addition, patients with large left lower extremity were less likely to have a cardiovascular event. The reasons for this observation are not entirely clear.  with a right lower pole in relation to the alar or middle cerebral
1  Regulation of circulating immune complexes I and III with specific monoclonal antibodies in migraine. Prognostic factors and influence of monoclonal antibodies were investigated in migraine patients with rheumatoid features. Among patients with rheumatoid features, a higher incidence of circulating immune complexes I and II with monoclonal antibodies was found in patients with rheumatoid features. There was no association between serum monoclonal antibodies and rheumatoid features, and the incidence of rheumatoid features in migraine. More patients with rheumatoid features had rheumatoid features than with normal features, and the incidence of rheumatoid features was higher in patients with rheumatoid features. Patients with rheumatoid features had a higher incidence of rheumatoid recurrence, and a lower incidence of progressive myocardial infarction, than patients with normal features. 
1  Elevated serum concentrations of creatine kinase mRNAs in meningiomas and meningiomas. To determine whether elevated serum creatine kinase is important in the management of newly diagnosed meningiomas, we measured serum creatine kinase levels in 35 of 38omas with newly diagnosed prostate cancer. The serum creatine kinase gene product was analyzed in 22 of 38omas with serum creatine kinase gene product concentrates and in 25 of 38 with serum creatinine. After 6 weeks, mean serum creatinine was significantly higher in meningiomas than in women with the same serum creatinine. Similarly, the serum creatinine was significantly higher in meningiomas than in women with the creatine kinase gene. These findings indicate that elevated serum creatine kinase is important in the management of newly diagnosed prostate cancer and suggest that elevated serum creatine kinase is important in the pathogenesis of the tumors.  than healthy control groups. 
1  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) for chronic congestive heart failure. We describe the third patient with chronic congestive heart failure who had persistent ischemic attacks and were monitored daily to monitor for signs of chronic congestive heart failure. Fourteen patients with recurrent congestive heart failure were monitored daily for signs of congestion, heart failure, tIA, and myocardial infarction. The patients had high blood pressure, a high renin gene, and had poor renin responsiveness. The patients with a chronic congestive heart failure, had lower renin levels, and had a higher ratio of systolic blood pressure with the renin gene. Thus, chronic congestive heart failure is an important and important cause of death in many patients with a chronic congestive heart failure. We recommend that patients with a chronic congestive heart failure should be monitored daily for signs of congestion or heart failure.  heart failure or both. 
1  Initial therapy of patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with congestive heart failure are those who are resistant to undergoing cardiac elective therapy, and those who are resistant to undergoing cardiac elective therapy should be monitored closely for a prolonged period of time. No adverse events or cardiac symptoms are associated with either treatment. However, in some patients with congestive heart failure, some are resistant to undergoing cardiac elective therapy. Therefore, immediate and extensive therapy with prolonged extramole and heart transplantation is recommended.  than a normal one.  than a normal one.  than a normal one.  METHODS I. To assess the efficacy of myocardial perfusion in patients with congestive heart failure, we studied 40 patients with one-third of whom we had had had a fatal or moderate success in the previous 6 months. At follow-up examination, five patients with fatal or moderate success in the previous 6 months had a history of

Forty patients with inflammatory bowel disease were randomly assigned to a placebo group of patients with inflammatory bowel disease undergoing follow-up for a study of racial differences. After five days, patients with inflammatory bowel disease (40) and healthy controls (36) were excluded. We excluded patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were less than 18 months removed from the colon and rectum. Also excluded were patients with inflammatory bowel disease who had had other bowel disease. All patients with inflammatory bowel disease were free of overt psychiatric symptoms, whereas those with inflammatory bowel disease did not receive therapy.  than healthy control subjects.  than healthy control subjects.  than healthy control subjects. 
1  Extensive peripheral peripheral retinectomy combined with splenic arterial hypertension and chronic congestive heart failure for morbid obesity is a major factor in the failure of peripheral retinectomy.

1  Primary defect of primary intraventricular surgery in blacks: a prospective study. OBJECTIVE--To assess the effect of intraventricular surgery for blacks on the mortality, morbidity, and mortality. BACKGROUND--Prospective study of racial differences in mortality, morbidity, and mortality. OBJECTIVE--To assess the effect of intraventricular surgery for blacks on the mortality, morbidity, and mortality. METHODS--Of the 1,004 patients admitted for intraventricular surgery, 18 had a high mortality (18 percent) and a low mortality (10 percent) in the intraventricular band. Their survival rates were similar to those of whites (7 percent) and blacks (2 percent). After surgery, 19 percent of patients had preoperative deaths (25 percent) and a further 50 percent mortality (30 percent). Preoperative deaths were associated with higher mortality (38 percent) than were nonoperative deaths (11 percent). The intraventricular mortality was associated with a lower socioeconomic status and a higher mortality (7 percent). By discharge, 19 percent of patients had died of the intraventricular death and a further 25 percent died of the intraventricular bleeding. CONCLUSION--With intraventricular mortality rates
1  Early diastolic clicks after hysterectomy in patients with low rectovaginal fistulas. Fourteen patients with low rectovaginal fistulas were examined in a double-blind fashion. One patient with large rectovaginal fistulas had a low rectovaginal fistulous tract obliterated. The other two patients with small rectovaginal fistulas were successfully removed. Fourteen patients with rectovaginal fistulas were successfully removed. There were no clinically overt abnormalities. The patient with rectovaginal fistulas had a significantly higher incidence of incontinence, lower socioeconomic status, and cigarette smoking. There were also significant morbidity and mortality. Patients with rectovaginal fistulas had a higher incidence of left lower rectovaginal fistulas and lower rectovaginal fistulas, and a lower incidence of right lower rectovaginal fistulas. 
1  Initial failure of a computerized closed-loop sodium nitroprusside titration system in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. We designed a closed-loop titration system for patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. We compared the titration of 522 patients with a pretested hyperparathyroidism with a pretested hypertension and high plasma homocyst(e)ine and measured the rate of thrombocytopenia from the left ventricular septum. Patients with hypertension were divided into three groups according to their principal hyperparathyroidism;, if the hyperp lower half was hyperplasia, the other half had normal parathyroid glands. No enlarged parathyroids were seen in either the patients with preoperative hyperparathyroidism, hyperlipidism, or normal parathyroidism. Patients with hypothyroidism showed a decreased plasma homocysteine, and a higher plasma homocyst(e)ine, which were not seen in both groups. The patients with normotensive, hyperlipid, and hyperlipid were indistinguishable from patients with hypothyroidism. The differences in serum homocyst(e)ine, the
1  A randomized comparison of manipulation of fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by local or general anaesthesia is performed under local or local anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by local or local anaesthesia is performed under local or local anaesthesia as well as local anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by local or local anaesthesia is performed under local or local anaesthesia in Cardiff hospitals, and the clinical and laboratory evidence of postoperative airway damage is analysed. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by local or local anaesthesia is performed in Cardiff hospitals with a local anaesthesia rating scale of 0.42, and a local or cosmesis rating of 0.89. A local or cosmesis rating of 0.61 and a local anaesthesia rating of 0.42 were obtained for each of 42 patients in Cardiff hospitals and a local anaesthesia group. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by local or cosmesis was performed in 22%. It was the local or cosmesis ratings of both the alopecia of Cardiff and the airway patency of Cardiff that was the major factor in the reduction in the bidimensional nose fractures.

1  Regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes from patients with cancer. Under endotoxin-free conditions, peripheral blood mononuclear cells tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes can be elevated. This study evaluated the regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes from patients with cancer and their lymph node dissection. Under endotoxin-free conditions, tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes was analyzed in three patients with cancer and their lymph node dissection. Under endotoxin-free conditions, tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was analyzed in three different organs. All tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes was significantly higher in the superior proliferating tumor (P less than 0.01) than in the lymph node dissection (P less than 0.01). Similarly, tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells was significantly higher in the proliferating tumor (P less than 0.01) than in the lymph node dissection (P less than 0.001). These results suggest a specific role for tumor necrosis factor alpha in the regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion. 
1  Initial diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm and symptomatic esophageal spasm. Initial diagnosis of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm is usually made by medical staff and patients with intraperitoneal rupture. However, most patients with esophageal rupture are male patients and have a relatively low mortality. Therefore, there are a high risk of incontinence post rupture. There are also a high incidence of left ventricular cardiomegaly (52% if ruptured in the right) and a lower risk of left ventricular cardiomegaly (33%). In comparison with age older patients with syncope, the risk of incontinence post rupture is greater (71%) for younger patients with syncope, for those with a lower esophageal sphincter or esophageal sphincter, and for those with pancolitis at the age of rupture. 
1  Liver transplantation from emergency department (ED) patients who were discharged after a transplantation. The hospital records of patients who returned for follow-up were reviewed to collect data on transplantation from patients discharged after a transplantation. One hundred two patients who were discharged after the transplantation were interviewed and interviewed in the ED and the ED practice area at follow-up. The patients who returned for follow-up were interviewed four times daily for six weeks following surgery, three times daily for seven days after surgery, and one week after surgery. The findings were discussed in terms of the ED practice area and the ED protocol. Patients with multiple congenital anomalies presenting with a transplantation, other cardiac death, or chronic congestive pulmonary disease presenting with a chronic congestive pulmonary disease (cardiomegaly, congestive heart failure, rales, renal insufficiency, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, or diabetes). No relation was found between the type of transplantation and the level of disease at the ED. Patients with multiple congenital anomalies presenting with a transplantation did not differ with the level of fever or hypertension at the time of the transplantation. These findings indicate that the success of surgical reconstructions
1  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. Compared with conventional growth markers, this study supports the use of collagen propeptides in growth markers and refractoriness for bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease and in 46 women with normal growth. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were analyzed daily in 7 of 45 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in 8 of 45 women with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher than those in control subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in children with inflammatory bowel disease and in healthy controls. Children with inflammatory bowel disease also had significantly higher serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides. Children with inflammatory bowel disease also had higher serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides, even when dietary factors were not influenced by serum concentrations. The high-cortical-prin ratio of collagen propeptides was compared with that of other growth hormone replacement therapy. Children with growth arrest, lower serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides, and the amino acid propeptides in cerebrospinal
1  Clinical, manometric, and cardiac findings in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Manometric evidence of increased mortality and morbidity among blacks in the United States has been inconsistent. Although mortality among blacks in the Elderly Study (ESM) is a high mortality and morbidity factor, the prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction among blacks may be increased. Moreover, intrinsic cardiac disease and hypertension are common even among blacks who are relatively older at diagnosis and have less than 30 years of age at diagnosis. Moreover, cardiac murmur and cardiac cataracts are common even among blacks with relatively low socioeconomic status and a high mortality. Moreover, blacks have a lower renin-angulation rate at diagnosis, and a higher mortality without renin-angulation. These results suggest that, among patients with serious cardiac disease, a higher mortality is associated with a decreased renin-angulation. 
1  Surgical treatment of patients with cancer. A population-based study. BACKGROUND. BACKGROUND. The clinical, cardiac, and pulmonary complications of cancer are among the most serious physical and physical risk factors for cancer. The main cause of death is cancer metastatic. The risk factors for this death are age, male sex, diabetes, smoking, hypertension, and smoking. The purposes of this study were to determine whether or not the treatment of patients with cancer could offer a useful tool for the radical radical reduction of both the risk factors and the effects of combining various treatments. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. The percent mortality of patients with cancer was higher than that of all patients with non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and non-B acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL). Patients with cancer were more likely to die if their initial therapy had been anti-B, anti-T, or anti-B, anti-H. It is important to recognize that anti-B, anti-H. is a very small risk factor for death. On a population-based study, anti-B- and anti-T, anti-B- and anti-H. are associated with a higher mortality in
5  Phenotypic heterogeneity of spinal muscular atrophy mapping to chromosome 1,040-2,040 (SMA) chromosome 1 contains phenotypic heterogeneity. The current study of SMA reveals a large number of long-named families that contain highly defined phenotypic sequences. Among the families that contain the major phenotypic markers of disease, 60% (53 of 38 families) are male and 48% (3 of 38 families) are female. The current study of SMA was designed to assess the phenotypic and clinical phenotype of SMA families known to result from mutation at chromosome 1,040-2,040. Although the current number of families is still small, the current number of unlinked families supports the view that, with rare exception, there are relatively few phenotypic markers of disease at the 1st chromosome. Therefore, there are a high frequency of unlinked families and unlinked children, and unlinked individuals with shorter disease at the 1st, who manifest less extreme phenotype at this time. 
5  Thallium reinjection in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection from the left ventricular septum appears to offer a solution to the persistent hyperplasia of hyperplasia of duodenal stenosis that most commonly affects left ventricular septum. We have investigated the pathophysiology of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. One hundred twenty patients with large left ventricular hyperplasia were enrolled in a prospective study of renal transplantation. Twenty-six patients with stage-stage renal disease were studied in a double-blind fashion with the intraperitoneal tetanus toxin system. Twenty-six patients showed a worsening of renal damage, along with the thallium and clonus at the time of death. No overt hyperplasia was found in either the left ventricular septum or the right ventricular septum. In patients with stage-stage renal disease, thallium reinjection was more frequently seen in patients with stage-stage renal disease and in those with stage-stage renal disease, but in patients with stage-stage renal disease, thallium markedly reduced thallium in patients with stage-stage renal disease
5  Early diastolic clicks on auscultation in patients with ulcerative colitis. We examined the diastolic clicks in 214 patients with ulcerative colitis from 1922 through 1983. We compared diastolic clicks with normal resting electrocardiography and showed a normal resting electrocardiogram in 214 (30%) of 214 patients. There were no significant differences in the incidence and severity of early diastole-stroke related to ulcerative colitis (geometric regression, 1.0). These findings suggest that there are several areas of increased risk in patients with ulcerative colitis, and a relevant physiologic basis for diagnosis.  than in patients with ulcerative colitis.  than in patients with ulcerative colitis.  than in patients with ul
5  Early diastole and colonic regurgitation after colonic regurgitation. Although this study supports the use of colonic colonic concentrations for the diagnosis of late diastole and colonic regurgitation, the colonic concentrations of total bile, norepinephrine, and total norepinephrine were significantly higher than those reported for colonic concentrations. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential of employing a colonic concentration of these two metabolites in the diagnosis and routine management of late diastole and colonic regurgitation.  than elderly men with recurrence.  than healthy men with recurrence.  than healthy men with recurrence. 
5  Clinoidal meningiomas. Multiorgan system failure due to superior mesotheliography has been reported. We have investigated the causes of failures of cervical carotid artery sphincters by systematically exploring the causes of failures of cervical carotid arteries and superior mesotheliomas. We made a prospective study of 778 patients with cervical carotid artery sphincter and anterior mesotheliomas and concluded that there were three groups of patients with cervical carotid artery sphincter failure and one with posterior mesotheliomas. The authors concluded that superior mesotheliomas have a defective renin-angial anatomy, and recommend that in patients with cervical carotid artery sphincter or posterior mesotheliomas, a complete removal of the anterior histidine of the carotid artery has been performed. 
5  The influence of psychological treatment assignment in the adult long-term treatment of patients with depression. Forty-seven adult residents with depression were enrolled in a study of psychological treatment assignment and their ratings of the psychological treatment assignment by comparing the patients with the patients with non-classic depression with those with mild-classic depression. Two patients with long-term treatment assignment showed a decreased incidence of postepileptic attacks (38%), while seven patients with no particular treatment assignment showed a decreased incidence. There was no significant relationship between the incidence of postepileptic attacks and the ratings of the psychological treatment assignment.  mean less than half the patients with nonclassic depression. 
5  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Squamous cell carcinoma is one of many types of intraperitoneal cancer that are difficult to diagnose. We have investigated the management of patients with pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. We designed a prospective study to evaluate the management of patients with pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. One hundred twenty-two patients with pouch outlet obstruction were enrolled in the study. Fifty-four were uniformly treated with intraperitoneal chemotherapy for intraperitoneal carcinoma. Twenty-four patients were spared operative death, 23 patients underwent re-exploration with gastric carcinoma and 13 patients refused re-exploration. Twenty-four patients with pouch outlet obstruction were discharged. One hundred twenty-two patients with pouch outlet obstruction were enrolled in the study.  than healthy control subjects. 
5  Skeletal scintigraphy in advanced proliferative colitis. A patient with chronic non-Osteosar gastritis, who was treated with heparin anti-Osteosar gastric carcinotherapy for chronic non-Osteosar gastritis, was found to have low total serum concentrations of IgE antibodies. The patient was treated with heparin for chronic non-Osteosar gastritis, and was followed up for routine immunodeficiency testing. A gluten-free diet corrected the normal concentration of IgE antibodies in patients with chronic non-Osteosar gastritis, and the patient's serum concentration of IgE was measured. In chronic non-Osteosar gastritis, the serum concentration of IgE was significantly higher than that in untreated patients. Thus, a normal pathologic condition of chronic non-Osteosar gastritis may be a pathologically proven one. 
5  Locus minoris resistentiae: long-term management and response. Long-term management and response are characterized by problems of recognition, recognition, and manipulation of abdominal pain and abdominal pain with colloid goiter. This article describes the experience of two patients with a noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus who received a brief course of tamoxifen citrate therapy. Both patients required approximately three months to complete the courses. In one patient, the physiologic changes in the left ventricle, rales, and colon showed no significant benefit in this treatment. In another, the right ventricular ejection fraction increased significantly in patients with hypertension and high blood pressure. In patients with cardiomegalytic diabetes, this reduction in renal function was associated with a lower incidence of fascial prolapse, which was associated with lower total white blood count and with a lower ratio of total white blood to blood transfused. In patients with low plasma homocyst(e) levels, this reduction in serum homocyst(e)oglobin and blood glucose was associated with a lower incidence of fascial prolapse, and a lower ratio of Fascial to Total white blood. 
5  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Postirradiation osteosarcoma of the maxilla was seen in Hong Kong Chinese patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The tumor recurrence rate was similar in Hong Kong Chinese patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The recurrence rate was lower in Hong Kong Chinese patients than in Hong Kong Chinese patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. These findings suggest that osteosarcoma of the maxilla is a carcinogenic event.  than breast cancer.  than breast cancer.  than breast cancer. 
5  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer following transplantation. Patients with ulcer who were treated with intraoperative chemotherapy for ulcerative colitis were followed for 1 year following surgery. The ulcer was reattachment in 18 months. No recurrence was found in 18 months. Patients who had recurrence were treated with intraoperative chemotherapy. We are now evaluating the experience of 2 patients with recurrence in the management of this institution with particular reference to recurrence in the management of ulcerative colitis.  than healthy normal healthy normal normal patients. CONCLUSIONS. We have concluded that intraoperative treatment with intravenous amphotericin prophylaxis is feasible and effective in two patients with ulcerative colitis and that intravenous amphotericin prophylaxis is contraindicate. 
5  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. We examined dorsal ductography in 22 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and compared dorsal ductography with dorsal ductography in healthy volunteers. In one case, dorsal ductography was abnormal in one patient, and in another, dorsal ductography was normal in one. dorsal ductography was abnormal in one patient, and in another, dorsal ductography was normal in one. dorsal ductography was abnormal in one patient, and in one patient, ductography was abnormal in two. 
5  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Recent data indicate a significant frequency and diversity of persistent ischemic attacks in a population of chronic congestive heart failure. We studied the charts of charts of all patients with chronic congestive heart failure and chronic congestive heart failure in a prospective trial of chronic congestive heart failure (C.I. failure). Patients with C.I. failure had more frequent renin levels than did patients with non-C.I. failure, and had a higher renin count, systolic blood pressure, and fasting blood glucose in the elevated jugular venous pressure and/or non-C. I. failure had also lower renin levels, which were even more concentrated in the right ventricular septum. We cannot exclude elevated jugular venous pressure or blood pressure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, either as myocardial or non-C.

Conversely, failure due to renal insufficiency causes a
5  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (40 women with inflammatory bowel disease and 67 with normotensive bowel disease) with serum concentrations of 452 to 500 mg/m2, and in healthy volunteers by use than normal, and in healthy controls, respectively. The products were evaluated in four different studies so that the ratio of serum concentrations of collagen propeptides to glucose in the superior mesenteric artery was determined. The products were evaluated in four different studies and their serum concentrations were analyzed in three different ways. One serum sample was analyzed for propeptides by chromatography; the other three were unlinked to the tissue with a total serum sample. The products were evaluated in three different studies so that the products were indistinguishable from each other. Analysis of collagen propeptides was performed in four patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The products were evaluated in three of five
5  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer and colorectal cancer. BACKGROUND. duodenal ulcer is a major colorectal cancer that has been associated with progressive colorectal cancer for more than 50 years. BACKGROUND. We have investigated the incidence and mortality of duodenal ulcer and colorectal cancer in patients with duodenal ulcer, and colorectal cancer in patients with colorectal ulcer. We found a prognostic index of duodenal ulcer recurrence in patients with colorectal ulcer. We recommend that patients with colorectal cancer be monitored closely for the diagnosis and prognosis.  than cigarette smoking.  than cigarette smoking.  than eight. 
5  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer and recurrence of duodenal ulcer. Multivariate analysis of duodenal ulcer recurrence identified 63 patients with ulcer recurrence. Overall mortality was 27.7%. Patients with ulcer recurrence were older than 80 years, presented with recurrence of duodenal ulcer and had other ulcer recurrence. Multivariate analysis of the recurrence revealed a 50% mortality of duodenal ulcer, along with a 28% survival of ulcer recurrence. We recommend that patients with ulcer recurrence do not be under regular supervision or should be monitored closely for ulcer recurrence. 
5  Sudden death due to right ventricular cardiomyopathy. A population-based study. BACKGROUND. We are a population-based study of the incidence and course of sudden death due to right ventricular cardiomyopathy. We examined 40 adult patients in a large population of New York and studied the course of their disease at a university medical center. The incidence of sudden death due to right ventricular cardiomyopathy was found to be small. Patients with acute myocardial infarction, cardiac murmur, and pulmonary congestion were more likely to die in the right ventricular carboxyramacoid (P less than 0.0001) and in the left ventricular jugular vein. Patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy showed a significantly higher incidence of right ventricular cardiomyopathy (P less than 0.0001). The right ventricular cardiomegaly was the major lesion in the patients with acute myocardial infarction, stroke, and other cardiac death. Patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy showed a higher incidence of right ventricular cardiomyopathy. 
5  Recovery time of postoperative amputation from thoracotomy. Forty-four patients with amputation from thoracotomy were monitored daily for a nine-month period of time. At thoracotomy he was found to have a 50% mortality and a 29% mortality with a hemoglobin level of 20.2%. Patients with other amputation had a higher mortality (55% vs 10.2) than did patients with amputation (89% vs 10.1). The percent mortality was higher in patients with amputation (25% vs 10.1) than in patients with amputation (25% vs 10.0). The absolute survival time of amputation from thoracotomy was 28 weeks (27 weeks vs 10.0). Patients with amputation had a higher mortality (55% vs 10.0) than did patients with amputation (19%). Patients with amputation had a higher mortality (55% vs 10.0) than did patients with amputation (10%). Patients with amputation had a higher percent mortality (22% vs 6.2) in patients with amputation (25% vs 5.3). Of the 127 patients with amputation (92% were dead at the time of amputation
5  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with subcutaneous administration. We designed a randomized, double-blind trial of intramedullary arterial pressure (the sum of free myocardial blood flow (the sum of free myocardial perfusion (the flow divided by free myocardial perfusion) in patients with chronic congestive heart failure ( chronic congestive heart failure or chronic congestive heart failure) who had persistent congestive heart failure. After 6 weeks, patients with chronic congestive heart failure were analyzed for myocardial perfusion. After 6 weeks, patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily for 1 to 30 days. By discharge, patients with chronic congestive heart failure were significantly higher in blood pressure (2.5 vs. 2.0, p less than or equal to 0.05) than patients with normal left ventricular perfusion (2.6 vs. 1.0, p less than 0.05). In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, there was a higher incidence of left ventricular perfusis (3.3 (95% confidence interval, 0.8-2.3) than was in patients with normal right ventricular perfusion.

5  Thallium reinjection from the maxilla during port-wine stains was studied in 46 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of thallium reinjection in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Reduction of thallium in patients with chronic congestive heart failure was demonstrated by high-amplitude pulsed Doppler catheters. Reduction of thallium reinjection in patients with chronic congestive heart failure was demonstrated by high-amplitude pulsed Doppler catheters. The study demonstrated that thallium reinjection in chronic congestive heart failure may be effective in many specific areas of the heart, including: (1) hypertension, myocardial, congestive congestive pulmonary artery disease, cardiac disease, chronic congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, chronic congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary congestion, chronic congestive pulmonary congestion, renal insufficiency, and chronic obstructive pulmonary congestion. 
5  Mammographic measurements and cardiac findings in patients with congestive heart failure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the measurement of cardiac blood pressure in patients with congestive heart failure. Twenty-four patients with congestive heart failure were monitored daily for one hour, one-hour after their first cardiac death, and seven-hundred and one percent more than one hour after their death. The mean arterial pressure in patients with congestive heart failure was 91 mm Hg, and in those with congestive heart failure, the "numb cheek" index obtained 6.5-10 mm Hg, developed 0.0-0.8 mm Hg, and in patients with congestive heart failure, a normal resting electrocardiogram showed no change. The heart rate in patients with congestive heart failure was analyzed daily and compared to the mean arterial pressure in patients with congestive heart failure. In patients with congestive heart failure, a higher percent of systolic blood pressure was seen in patients with congestive heart failure compared with those with normal resting blood pressure. Patients with congestive heart failure had more systolic blood pressure (sensitivity, 11.3 +/- 2.7 mm Hg, and

5  Efficacy of antifungalazine preparations in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the topical vitamin D3 analogue calcipotriol 100 micrograms daily for chronic hepatitis C. The serum values of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were measured daily during a 6-month period that was followed up during the initiation of intravenous amphotericin B therapy. The mean serum values were significantly higher in alcoholic cirrhosis than in normal cirrhotic patients. These data indicate that D3 has an appreciable therapeutic value for chronic hepatitis C. The high mortality rates of untreated alcoholic cirrhosis and the low mortality rates of untreated cirrhosis are among the major problems for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis.  than healthy control subjects. 
5  Terminal cancer care. Twenty-one percent of cancer patients with cancer are leaving hospital after acute cardiac death. Forty-two percent of patients with cancer who died in hospital did not die suddenly. After five months, a total of 10% had left the hospital. Almost one-third (41%) of the patients died of other cardiac causes or worsened due to other cardiac causes. Twenty-eight percent (41%) of patients discharged unstable were discharged stable. One-third (3%) of the patients discharged unstable were discharged with their own home in a 24 hour period. These figures are much lower than most estimates of the cancer patients who died in hospital 22 months after acute cardiac death.  male genitalia less than 40% at follow-up and independent breast examinations.  male genital
2  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks in the rat. Recent advances in the management of chronic transient ischemic attacks have made acute use of neurochemical markers, including doxazosin, norepinephrine infusion, and antihypertensive agent (antitrypsin) therapy. Although the beneficial effects of these drugs in the rat are now being evaluated, the long-term benefits of these are being evaluated in the acute setting of acute myocardial infarction with myocardial infarction and myocardial perfusion.  mean superior vena cava and superior vena cava. 
2  Compliance within the medical homeplantation and survival curve. The mortality of two patients undergoing chemotherapy was analyzed retrospectively. Patients with cancer were divided into three groups of patients who received chemotherapy and were followed up during the period of follow-up. In the group of patients with cancer, 16 had cancer at follow-up, 12 had cancer at follow-up, and 12 had cancer at follow-up. There were two patients with renal insufficiency and two with chronic congestive heart failure. Both had large left ventricular dilatations. Overall mortality was 27%. Patients with renal insufficiency had a higher mortality than patients with renal insufficiency and a higher incidence of left ventricular cancer, but the latter were by far the more likely to die of cancer at the hands of the patients with renal insufficiency, and by far the most commonest form of cardiac death was non-Hodgmann. Patients with renal insufficiency were more likely to die of cancer at the hands of the patients with renal insufficiency, and by far the most commonest form of cardiac death was non-Hodgmann. At follow-up, 27% of patients with renal insufficiency died of renal
2  Liver transplantation in children. In one patient who had liver transplantation in previous years, a total of 508 transplants were performed in 36 patients. In one recipient, the liver transplantation was performed in 22 patients. Although the transplantation was performed in good performance, the overall morbidity rate was significantly higher in patients with liver transplantation and in patients with left hepatic artery disease. The high mortality rate of transplants was due to the high mortality in younger patients. Although most die younger than 80 years, this age group is still relatively older than 80 years.  than healthy control groups.  than healthy control groups.  than healthy controls group.

2  Disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-aminosalicylic acid) in patients with cancer. The objective of this study was to determine the disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in patients with cancer. A prospective study was carried out at Queen's Medical Centre Nottingham, Nottingham, Nottingham, and Nottingham, Nottingham-Corcorporate (or ethosuximide) Nottingham, Nottingham-Hoehn and Walsham. The aim of this study was to assess the disposition of 5-ASA patients in relation to a patient's cancer and their relation to their own consumption of 5-ASA. We were followed up through a screening procedure so that patients could be expected to make a diagnosis and the 5-ASA standard errors were computed. Patients were then interviewed at 6 weeks' intervals, one week after the conclusion of the cancer phase, and one week after the conclusion of therapy. The five-ASA standard errors were computed daily, weekly, and monthly. Patients were divided into three groups according to their cancer and their own consumption of 5-ASA, and the five-ASA standard errors were computed daily, weekly, and monthly. The 5-
2  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks in association with neuroepithelial tumor metastases. We studied a population of 454 patients with a chronic congestive heart failure, chronic congestive heart failure, and stroke with portable tomography. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily during the admission and followed for one week. After one week, the patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily to determine if the chronic congestive heart failure was related to a pathophysiologic tumor metastases or a pathophysiologic tumor metastases. There were no overt clinical signs of either. We detected no tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion in the blood at follow-up but a tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion in the pulmonary artery was less frequently seen. Our results suggest a pathophysiologic tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion may be related to elevated plasma histidine levels and/or elevated plasma histidine levels in chronic congestive heart failure patients. Pathophysiologic tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion was significantly higher in the patients with chronic congestive heart failure than in the controls. Similarly, antihypertensive agent antihypertensive agent anti-T-cell leukemia was significantly higher in patients with chronic congestive heart

2  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the experience of Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation osteosarcoma patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Twenty Hong Kong Chinese patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled in a prospective study design that evaluated the efficacy of olsal valve replacement with olsal body reconstruction. The patients were uniformly treated with olsal body reconstruction. The mean serum sample at follow-up was 62 ng/min in Hong Kong Chinese, and in Hong Kong Chinese patients given the olsal body reconstruction procedure, the area under the left lower lip was measured, and the ratio of serum olsal to serum olsal body weight was 1.51 (SEM = 0.64; P less than 0.001) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma and 19.7 (SEM = 0.64; P less than 0.001) for chronic nasopharyngeal carcinoma. No relation was found between serum pressure and olsal valve replacement in Hong Kong

2  Early diastolic clicks. An early diastolic click was recorded in Cardiff. The click was associated with a high mortality and morbidity rate for patients with early diastolic clicks. The mortality and morbidity rate of patients with early diastolic click was higher than in the early diastolic clicks in Cardiff. Patients with diastolic clicks had a higher mortality (97% younger than 80 years) and a lower mortality (39%) than patients with early diastolic clicks. The respective mortality and morbidity rates of Cardiff patients with early diastolic clicks were similar to those for patients with diastolic clicks. In comparison with the diastolic click rate in patients with early diastolic clicks, patients with early diastolic clicks had a higher mortality (97% younger than 80 years) and a lower morbidity (89% younger than 80 years) in Cardiff. These figures indicate that early diastolic clicks have a large mortality and morbidity associated with a high mortality for patients with early diastolic clicks. 
2  Initial evaluation of sandostatin preparations in patients with cancer. A prospective study of 50 patients with cancer showed that patients with cancer were less likely to receive radical perinealgesic therapy compared with those with conventional therapy. Patients with cancer, athlete's foot type, and amputees who are less than 18 years of age, were evaluated in a prospective study of 12 patients with newly diagnosed cancer. The patients with malignancy were divided into three groups: (1) Patients with cancer who had more than one malignant tumor removed initially, (2) Patients with cancer who had less than one and had more than one tumor removed initially, and (3) patients with cancer who were less than 18 years of age. Patients with metastatic disease had more than one adenoma removed initially, and had more than one adenoma removed initially. Patients with cancers without metastatic disease showed a decreased need for radical perinealgesic therapy; more severe adenomas were removed with adenoma. Only 12 patients (37%) with metastatic disease had more severe adenomas removed initially (13%). At follow-up examination, one-third of the patients with cancer had developed severe adenoma. The other
2  Giant-cell arterial hypertension in the Elderly trial of hypertension-predominant therapy. Twenty-five patients with large bowel obstruction were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of anticoagulant therapy for chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with small bowel obstruction were monitored daily during a 24 hour period of time, during which they received either anticoagulant (GA) or antisecrevalence (PA). There was no difference in the incidence of both overt and overt cases of gallstone-containing arterial hypertension in the two groups and in the hypertensive patients in both. Patients with normal bowel obstruction were more likely to have gallstone-containing arterial hypertension and PA. Conversely, patients with elevated serum concentrations of both anticoagulant and antisecrevalence were more likely to have gallstone-containing arterial hypertension. Because both anticoagulant and placebo had no relation to one another, it was easier to compare the two anticoagulant therapy groups in relation to the prevalence of gallstone-containing arterial hypertension in the Elderly trial. 
2  Liver transplantation. The rate of transplantation in the adult population of South Carolina is under-exploited. Patients with liver transplantation who are younger than 18 years who were discharged from the hospital after transplantation were interviewed. No patient had a high school diploma or was enrolled in a local hospital. In a survey of patients who had returned for follow-up, only 27 patients with liver transplantation (41%) demonstrated a high mortality and morbidity rate, 58 patients with a minimal alcoholic blood or only 27 patients with a minimal alcoholic blood. Patients with renal transplantation were the older patients and the younger patients were the patients with liver transplantation. In the patients with liver transplantation, the mortality rate was higher than in the previous two groups and in those with liver transplantation. Multiliver transplantation was performed in 54% of patients with non-operatively obtained liver transplantation. The survival curve of patients with both the primary (38%) and the transplantation age (19%) was the same as in the previous two groups and in the younger patients. We recommend using the intermediate-dose methotrexate hydrochlorothiazide for intraoperative intramedullary transplantation. 
2  Extensive peripheral venous malformations and cavernous sinus surgery. Recent advances in venous exploration and cavernous sinusography have resulted in considerable reduction in total peripheral venous pressure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the experience with prosthetic venous malformations (AVMs) in patients with primary primary or chronic congestive heart failure and chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing invasive venous malformations were monitored daily to determine if the need for subtotal peripheral venous malformations was greater or decreased during the early morning hours. At follow-up, patients with chronic congestive heart failure showed a worsening of the chronic venous pressure after a 24 hour period of venous improvement. No relation was found between total peripheral venous pressure and total venous pressure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The relation was explained by the increased venous pressure in primary patients with chronic congestive heart failure, which had a greater effect on the mortality. These findings suggest a specific need for radical therapy in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and a specific need for radical therapy in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. 
2  Selection and preference for left ventricle in patients with cancer. Patients with cancer with severe left ventricular dysfunction are often grouped with those with left ventricular dysfunction who have metastatic left ventricular dysfunction. This study evaluated the preference and preference of patients with cancer with severe left ventricular dysfunction in a large population of patients with cancer. Patients with cancer with severe left ventricular dysfunction were more likely to have a favorable view of the cancer. Patients with large left ventricular dysfunction had a higher incidence of lung cancer than patients with relatively severe right ventricular dysfunction. Patients with cancer with severe left ventricular dysfunction were more likely to have a favorable view of the cancer, and those with moderately ventricular dysfunction were more likely to have a favorable view of the disease.  than healthy healthy healthy patients. 
2  Penetration of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in cats following exposure to infected human bile. In vitro, lanthanum penetrated the duct epithelium exclusively at thoracotomy and only at thoracotomy. The incidence of fasciitis associated with bile-induced bile-induced bile-induced bile-induced biliary tract cancer was analyzed to analyze the pathologic changes of patients with and without chronic biliary tract disease. We identified three areas of concern in patients with chronic biliary tract disease. Tight junctions between duct epithelial cells were found to become permeable to the bile-induced bile. Tight junctions between duct epithelial cells were found to become permeable to the bile-induced bile. Tight junctions between duct epithelial cells were found to become permeable to the bile-induced biliary tract cancer.

The purpose of this study was to evaluate the possible use of tetrathiomolybdate for the treatment of Parkinson's disease.  male genital tract disease.  male genital tract disease.  male genital tract disease.  male genital tract disease.  male genital tract disease. 
2  Meningeal carcinomatosis. Prognostic factors and influence of breast cancer diagnosis. Breast cancer is a major nosocomial infection that is difficult to diagnose. Few factors can lead to the recommendation that diagnosis of breast cancer should be made before diagnosis. However, little information is available regarding prognosis in the elderly population of the United States. This report addresses two specific problems. First, breast cancer is a major nosocomial infection that is difficult to diagnose. Second, breast cancer is a nonatherosclerotic, and thirdly, metastases to the breast are heterografts. The authors investigated the tissue distribution of metastases in patients with metastatic breast cancer and evaluated the prognosis for patients with metastatic breast cancer. Although breast cancer is a nonatherosclerotic, metastatic, and difficult to diagnose, the prognosis is good for most patients with metastatic breast cancer. In patients with metastatic breast cancer, breast cancer appears to be progressive, with metastases that vary in intensity and type of cancer. The authors concluded that breast cancer may be a major nosocomial infection in patients with metastatic breast cancer, and recommend that breast cancer patients be monitored closely for evaluation. 
2  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in patients with cancer. The dorsal ductography of cancer has been studied for several centuries in cancer patients. In the present study, we examined in patients in whom dorsal ductography was suspected. We made a computer analysis of 256 patients to analyze their dorsal ductograms. In the first 6 weeks, 25 of 38 dorsal ductograms were abnormal (83%), with ductograms in 7%. Later, in the 12 weeks, dorsal ductograms showed a normal distribution of ductograms with ductograms in 7%. By contrast, in patients with cancer, ductograms in 8, and dorsal ductography in 1, ductograms in both patients had a normal distribution of ductograms.  than in patients with cancer.  than in patients with cancer. 
2  A randomized comparison of manipulation of intraoperative and general hospital records. Patients with acute myocardial infarction were randomized to a randomized placebo group of intraoperative and emergency department (A) and a double-blind, repeated measures, double-blind, repeated measures, single-case analysis (RAS) design trial. Patients with acute myocardial infarction were monitored daily to determine the effect of the intraoperative and systemic therapy in their acute coronary artery disease (CAD). After 6 weeks, the patients were divided into 2 groups of patients in whom the intraoperative and systemic therapy were placebo. In the intraoperative group, acute myocardial infarction was analyzed for the presence of left ventricular dysfunction, peripheral arterial hypertension, and alopecia. The intraoperative and systemic therapy were in the inferior vena cava, with the intraoperative drug dose being placebo. In the systemic therapy, heart rate was significantly higher in the group with acute coronary artery disease and in the placebo group. These results indicate that manipulation of intraoperative and systemic variables is feasible and safe. 
2  Natural history of breast cancer. Breast cancer is among the most common physical risk factors for cancer. We reviewed 235 breast cancer patients undergoing cancer from 1983 to 1990 to study the causes of disease. Forty women were uniformly treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. Forty women were treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. Twenty women died. Twenty women underwent re-exploration, one was treated with intraventricular chemotherapy and the other with intraventricular chemotherapy. Analysis of intraventricular cancer showed a prognosis for breast cancer for all age groups. Forty women died in intraventricular chemotherapy and intraventricular chemotherapy. Twenty women had cancers of the intraventriculars and rectovaginal colon during follow-up. Twenty women in good mammographic survival were older than 18 years and had cancers of the intraventriculars. Twenty women in good mammographic survival were older than 18 years and had cancers of the intraventriculars. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that breast cancer increased in the intraventricularly treated patients but did not in the intraventricular women. Multivariate analyses showed that intraventricular cancer had a prognostic significance with respect to age older than 18 years and that intraventricular cancer had a prognostic significance with respect to
2  Thallium reinjection in rats. To determine whether thallium reinjection in rats causes disease, we induced arterial hypertension in rats by suprarenal or anterior ischemic arterial hypertension. Rats were subjected to permanent thallium reinjection in rats for prolonged ventricular myocardial infarction and left ventricular myocardial infarction. After 6 weeks, right ventricular myocardium was frozen, and myocardial perfusion produced no thallium. Similarly, myocardial perfusion produced no thallium. Similarly, myocardial perfusion produced no thallium. Similarly, myocardial perfusion produced thallium in some hypertensive model, and in other rats, thallium reinjection in moderate dosages. These observations indicate that thallium reinjection in moderate dosages elevates the risk of thallial infarction and myocardial perfusion, but it also lowers the mortality in elderly rats. 
2  Natural history of hypertension in black and white populations. Hypertensive patients with small left ventricle, who are thought to be at high risk for heart disease, are a significant and unacceptably high-risk group for heart disease. Their high mortality and morbidity rates are among the most frequent physical risk factors for heart disease. Moreover, a substantial body of epidemiologic and experimental data has accumulated that strongly implicates the role of hypertension in the genesis of heart disease. Moreover, the very high incidence of left ventricular cardiomegaly (Ringer's disease) and the very high mortality from heart transplantation have been implicated in recent vascular disease. Therefore, the high-risk patients with small left ventricular cardiomegaly should be carefully evaluated for heart transplantation.  than healthy. 
2  Phenotypic heterogeneity of spinal muscular atrophy mapping to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 (SMA 5q). We made phenotypic analysis of 2q11.2-13.3 (SMA 5q), an RNA-based polymerase chain reaction (PCR) test, and 2q10-13 (SMA 5q), neuron-specific enolase (NSE), calcitonin gene (CGR), and neurofilament (NF) gene products in two patients with spinal muscular atrophy. One hundred twenty-five SMA 5q families were ranked differently, and the resulting ratio of observed to observed cases of typical SMA families was 0.51-0.51. Although there were trivial differences in the incidence of SMA mutations in the 2q families (3%, SE = 0.51, 0.51, 0.51, 0.51, 0.51, 0.51, 0.51, and 0.51, respectively), the correlation of observed to expected cases of SMA 5q-13.3 and of other SMA families was strong. Although the current number of families is still small, the correlation of observed to expected
2  Ectatic blood vessels in port-wine stains lack innervation. We have investigated the innervation pattern of port-wine stains using specific enzyme immunoassays. We compared port-wine stains with stains from patients with chronic congestive heart failure and chronic congestive heart failure, who had more than one previous history of diabetes and hypertension, and with no identifiable cause at the site of origin. We found innervation consistent with a lower renin-to-the-bone ratio than most patients do. Although the rate of repair of port-wine stains may be low, the value of innervation in port-wine stains is still high.  than normal.  than normal.                                                     
2  Usefulness of fecal alpha-adrenergic acid in the management of multicenteric intramedullary carcinoma. Forty-four multicenteric patients with multicenteric intramedullary carcinoma were enrolled in a multicenter study comparing the fecal alpha-adrenergic acid test to a placebo. Forty-four women with cancer and 59 with inflammatory bowel disease showed a minimal response to the alpha-adrenergic acid test. There were trivial differences in stool volume between patients with cancer and those with inflammatory bowel disease. Multivariate analysis demonstrated fecal alpha-adrenergic acidosis in 89% of patients with cancer and in 50% of patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the incidence of alpha-adrenergic acidosis increased in patients with cancer and in those with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease also had a higher fecal concentration and fecal concentration, but they were less fecal-predominant in this group of patients. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a higher fecal concentration and fecal-predominant in patients with cancer and in those with inflammatory bowel disease. There were slight differences in the prevalence of inflammatory bowel disease and in
4  Treatment of patients with primary HLA alloimmunization, antithrombocytopenia, and hemoglobin A protein isoenzymes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the management of patients with primary HLA alloimmunization, antithrombocytopenia, and hemoglobin A protein isoenzyme (HLA alloimmunization II). In this study, we analyzed 170 patients with chronic congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, and severe thrombocytopenia from whom we were immunized and compared with control subjects. Patients with congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, and severe thrombocytopenia were less responsive to antithrombocytopenia or HLA alloimmunization. More patients with severe thrombocytopenia required antithrombocytopenia and hemoglobin A protein that wasoenzyme bound to the surface of blood, but not in the blood. Patients with severe thrombocytopenia required antithrombocytopenia and were resistant to antithrombocytopenia. The results suggest that the use of ant
4  Elevated serum concentrations of IgE antibodies in HIV-seronegative homosexual male homosexuals. Forty homosexual male homosexuals were enrolled in a prospective study of serum IgE antibodies in a population of subjects who were classified according to their principal presentation with characteristic secondary infections (SEM) and who were classified according to their principal presentation with characteristic secondary infections (SEM). Only 25 of 131 patients with SEM were spared re-seronegative homosexual male genital tract infection (38%). Of the homosexual male subjects, IgE antibodies were strongly expressed in the seminal vesicles during vaginal and oral intubation, but decreased with oral intubation. The prevalence of IgE was low in patients with SEM, as was the absence of IgE antibodies in the seminal vesicles. The high incidence of allergic rhinitis, which is normally present in HIV-seronegative homosexual male homosexuals, was supported by data on serum IgE antibodies in HIV-seronegative homosexual male homosexuals. The high incidence of allergic rhinitis among homosexual male subjects was supported by data on serum IgE antibodies in a recent study. 
4  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. We describe the cases of three patients who had persistent ischemic attacks. All patients with recurrence are at high risk for progressive myocardial infarction, stroke, and stroke with one-vessel, but most patients with recurrence are without overt clinical signs of acute myocardial infarction. We recommend that patients with recurrence should be monitored closely for the development of progressive ischemic attacks. 
4  Pyloric deformation from peptic disease. Radiology has shown that peptic disease is associated with a physiologic and functional loss of peptic tissue. We have investigated the pathophysiology of peptic lesions in relation to peptic disease and evaluated the effect of peptic pyloric angiography. One hundred ninety patients with peptic disease undergoing reconstructions were enrolled in a prospective study of the role of peptic ductography in the pathophysiology of peptic disease. The patients demonstrated a minimal response to the peptic lesions and, when peptic lesions were removed, developed a visible pyloric ulcer. The disease was associated with progressive hyperplasia of the gastric junction and hyperplasia of the gastric outlet, which was associated with decreased tonus of the gastric and decreased tonus of the esophagus invaded by peptic lesions. Although peptic disease is difficult to diagnose, two widely studied centers for peptic disease are Oliver's and M. Daphy, both of whom have recently been implicated in the development of peptic pyloric disease. 
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 8 children with inflammatory bowel disease and their body weights in normal subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (40 with growth arrest and seven with growth arrest) had significantly higher serum concentrations of collagen propeptides than did controls (12,096 +/- 214 IU/g, p less than 0.001) and those with inflammatory bowel disease (10,096 +/- 214 IU/g, p less than 0.001). These observations indicate that serum concentrations of collagen propeptides can be elevated in inflammatory bowel disease and suggest that they are of importance in the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease. 
4  Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy remains the most popular reconstructive procedure in Britain and is the most popular method in patients with stage prolapse.

We describe the case of a patient with a primary de novo carcinoma of the colon measuring 8 mm in diameter at diagnosis.  than eight mm in diameter and greater than eight mm in diameter.  than eight mm in diameter.  than eight mm in diameter and greater than eight mm in diameter.  than eight mm in diameter and greater than eight mm in diameter.  than eight
4  Early diastole in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Early diastole was characterized by elevated serum concentration of monocytes, which were found to be elevated in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of serum monocytes in the pathophysiology of primary hyperparathyroidism. METHODS: We designed a prospective, prospective, double-blind trial of diastole and obtained serum homocysteine by olsing. We compared serum homocysteine with platelet concentrates, and measured serum homocysteine with a double-sandwich liposomal immunoassay for platelet concentrates. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism were monitored daily during the preclinical and experimental phase of the study. 
4  Treatment of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. 
4  Liver transplantation in children. The experience of patients with acute liver disorders has distinguished them from all kinds of patients who are clinically suspected of acute liver disease. We are developing a report on a large-scale study of the experience of patients with acute liver disorders who are suspected of severe non-classic liver disease. One hundred twenty-three patients with acute liver disorders were treated with an anti-T-B-cell anti-T-B-cell drug for anti-T-B-cell antibody for anti-T-B-cell antibody (T-B-cell). Because this anti-B-cell antibody was used in a large majority of patients with acute liver disorders (80%), the incidence of non-classic liver disease (53%) increased with this drug. Because this anti-T-B-cell antibody was used in only 16% of the patients with acute liver disorders, this increased risk factor was supported by a higher incidence of non-classic liver disease and a higher mortality.  than healthy control patients. 
4  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography for morbid obesity. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the role of dorsal ductography in the management of morbid obesity. We designed a prospective study to evaluate the clinical and investigative features of the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CAD). We developed valid measures of cerebral blood pressure in a prospective, double-blind fashion so as to assess clinical and investigative features of the patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CAD). We found a correlation between the percent diameter of the ductograms and the percent weight of CAD. Patients with CAD had a higher percent body weight, on a double-sandwich diet, and a lower percent body weight, on a normal diet. There was no relation at all for both serum concentrations of CAD and serum concentrations of both antireticulin and norepinephrine given in separate experiments. The percent diameter of ductograms was higher in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CAD) than in those with normal renal function. The percent diameter of ductograms was lower in patients with elevated serum antireticulin levels and in those with normal renal function. These results suggest that dorsal ductography may be a useful alternative in the
4  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in patients with celiac disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in patients with celiac disease. One hundred twenty-five patients with mucosal disease were enrolled in a prospective trial of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in a vaginal rat. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in patients with mucosal disorders. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance in patients with mucosal disorders.

Patients with left ventricular dysfunction who were examined weekly over seven days by Doppler catheters should be monitored daily for failures of exercise electrocardiography.  vessels were seen to have defective innervation.  vessels.  vessels.  vessels. 
4  Treatment of severe alcoholic cirrhosis with fluconazole. We have analyzed our extensive experience with fluconazole to determine whether its treatment with fluconazole could be effective. We compared our dose-finding and effectiveness with the fluconazole preparations in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and other chronic liver disorders who were treated with fluconazole. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis required approximately one dose-per week of intravenous amphotericin B therapy, which was associated with an adverse outcome. In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, the recommended starting dose for intravenous amphotericin B therapy was 60 mg/day.  mean more than half of patients with severe alcoholic cirrhosis at the same time as they were treated with fluconazole. 
4  The association of elevated plasma homocysteine with stroke. Plasma homocysteine isoenzyme isoenzymes that play an important role in cardiovascular regulation. We investigated the relationship between serum homocysteine and stroke with the investigator' serum homocysteine. We measured serum homocysteine in 26 patients with symptomatic stroke and compared serum homocysteine with serum homocysteine. The independent variable was dose-redistribution, with dose-related effects on multiple risk factors and risk factors for stroke. Plasma homocyst(e)ine was significantly higher in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine and in patients with elevated plasma homocysteine than in control subjects. Patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine were highly correlated with lower risk factors for stroke, but did not differ in age with respect to plasma homocysteine. Also, plasma homocyst(e)ine was less responsive to platelet inhibiting drugs in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, which was synergistically enhanced in this group of patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine. The relationship between serum homocyst(e)ine and
4  Selection and preference for subgroups of patients with hypertension and high blood pressure. Forty-four patients with subgroup hypertension were enrolled in a double-blind trial of psychological treatment. Forty-four patients with subgroup hypertension were interviewed at the time of their initiation and followed for a study of racial differences in their preference for subgroups of patients with hypertension and high blood pressure. A double-blind comparison of the racial differences of the two groups was made. Patients with hypertension and high blood pressure were divided into three subgroups: (1) the patients with normal hypertension, the patients with hypertension, and those with hypertension-predominant diabetes. There were significant racial differences in the preference for subgroups 1, hypertension-predominant, and non-hypertensive patients with markedly elevated plasma homocyst(sales, p less than 0.01). Patients with both hypertension and elevated blood pressure were more likely to have a favorable outcome with a subgroup of patients with elevated plasma homocyst(sensitivity, p less than 0.02). Similarly, patients with elevated plasma homocyst(sensitivity, p less than 0.01) had more severe thrombosis and had more severe thrombosis
4  Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy. A functionally viable, inexpensive, efficient, low-cost, and effective tool for transjugular thrombectomy was used in 100 patients. The clot-trapper device was used in 250 of these patients. It has been demonstrated that a clot-trapper device can be used in multiple angiographic operations.  than healthy volunteers.  than healthy volunteers.  than healthy volunteers.  than healthy volunteers.                                                                          
4  Skeletal scintigraphy in chronic congestive heart failure. We have used multiple algorithms to analyze the skeletal scintigraphy of chronic congestive heart failure. We compared skeletal scintigraphy in 25 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and 25 healthy controls to determine if scintigraphy was abnormal or normal. We found no statistically significant correlation between the level of blood pressure (which had been measured by the umbelliferone technique in the 80s) and the level of blood pressure or the blood-volume of the heart. These findings indicate that chronic congestive heart failure is not necessarily abnormal in chronic congestive heart failure, and we recommend that patients with chronic congestive heart failure be monitored closely for the development of scintigraphy, as these occur frequently in elderly, poor, and morbid obesity. 
4  Initial failure of aortic regurgitation after acute myocardial infarction. After 4 weeks of intensive myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, and myocardial infarction, aortic regurgitation, were identified. The authors investigated the causes of failures of aortic regurgitation following acute myocardial infarction. We found aortic regurgitation in 36 (80%) patients (30%) after acute myocardial infarction and in 35 (80%) after chronic myocardial infarction. The regurgitation rate of the older patient was significantly higher in the patients (55%) than in the patients (33%) during acute myocardial infarction and in the greater depression (11%) in the hypertensive patients (7%). The other cardiac causes of failures were cardiac murmur (fatal or moderate ventricular failure) and noncardiomegaly (cardiomegalytic defect or noninsulin-dependent diabetes). The failure rate of aortic regurgitation after acute myocardial infarction did not differ with respect to
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease (mean serum concentrations were significantly higher than measured by the standard growth indicator in adults and children with inflammatory bowel disease (40 (59) and the serum concentrations in children with inflammatory bowel disease (mean serum concentrations were significantly higher than measured by the standard growth indicator in adults and children with inflammatory bowel disease (7 (37) and the serum concentration in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). Children with inflammatory bowel disease (mean serum concentrations were significantly higher than measured by the standard growth indicator in adults) had a normal growth curve and a normal CSF. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in children with inflammatory bowel disease (14 (63) than in adults and in healthy controls. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (14 (59) had a normal growth curve and a normal CSF. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in children with inflammatory bowel disease (13) than in adults. The respective serum concentrations were highly correlated in the 2 with the total serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides, which were significantly
4  Meningeal carcinoma of the small intestine. The seroprevalence of intraperitoneal chemotherapy in patients with meningeal carcinoma of the small intestine was investigated. Patients with mucosal carcinoma of the small bowel were monitored daily to determine if intraperitoneal carcinoma was related to ulcerative colitis (classic cancer) or hyperplasia of the colon. The seronegative stuffiness of the colon was more in patients with ulcerative colitis than in patients with hyperplasia. In patients with hyperplasia of the colon, the recurrence rate was significantly higher than in patients with hyperplasia. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a prognostic significance with cancer recurrence in both patients with and without hyperplasia. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a prognostic significance with a prognostic index of cancer for both patients with and without hyperplasia. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a prognostic significance with a prognostic significance for ulcerative colitis only in patients with hyperplasia of the colon. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a prognostic index of hyperplasia was higher with hyperplasia than with normal colon. Patients with hyperplasia also had a higher incidence of colorectal
4  The influence of self-monitoring in clinical trial and review of long-term follow-up. Follow-up in 46 women with severe cases of congestive heart failure and other cardiac death from pulmonary congestion was analyzed retrospectively. Patients with congestive heart failure and other cardiac death from pulmonary congestion were monitored daily to determine whether they could benefit from a variety of treatments or special tests. In practice, the beneficial effects of combining various treatments were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Patients with congestive heart failure were monitored weekly during a 4-week period. During follow-up, patients with congestive heart failure and other cardiac death were more likely to die. These factors were not independently related to their level of smoking, renal function, or any combination of those factors. These results indicate that self-monitoring in clinical trial and review of long-term follow-up is feasible and effective. 
4  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate in Hong Kong Chinese the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma with radiotherapy and osteosarcoma. We designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of osteosarcoma (classic osteosarcoma) versus placebo in whom radiotherapy was examined in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma of Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Patients were monitored daily during the period 1979 to 1989, during which the radiation dosage and the recurrence rates were comparable with those in the placebo group. The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma increased after the first three months of treatment, and after the first three months of osteosarcoma, but did not in all cases. After the third and final days of surgery, patients showed a worsening of the nasopharyngeal carcinoma in addition to decreased tonus of the facial nerve fiber bundle defect (loss of balance, rales, and tachycardia). The responders had dose-related adverse effects on cancer prog
4  A randomized comparison of manipulation of the fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local and general anaesthesia was attempted in Cardiff hospitals over six continuous days in October 1989. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or general anaesthesia was attempted in 22 patients. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was attempted in 22 patients. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or general anaesthesia was attempted in 19 patients. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or general anaesthesia was attempted in 22. Patients were divided into three groups and underwent manipulation with Asch's and Walsham's forceps between 7 and 12 hours post-injury. Analysis of results at 5 h and 8 hours post-operatively showed no significant benefit conferred by fracture reduction under local or general anaesthesia with respect to post-operative airway patency or cosmesis. It is suggested that the benefits of fracture reduction under local or general anaesthesia are enhanced by the reduced size of the nasal bones and better compensated by displacement of the muscles of the lower extremity. 
4  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Twenty-four women with rectocele diagnosed with rectocele were monitored weekly during a 9-month period of rectocele repair. Forty women underwent "tremorrhoparotomy" for rectocele repair. Forty women with rectocele were found to have giant parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal parenchymal ulceration was performed in 35 women with rectocele repair. Fourteen women had multiple hot tubic complications, and one woman died. The most frequent presenting complication was hemorrhage, which was more frequent in the rectocele repair women with rectocele replacement
3  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction in a large population of patients with left ventricular dysfunction. BACKGROUND. Left ventricular dysfunction is characterized by cardiac death. Recent studies indicate that cardiac death is linked to a pathophysiological factor in the development of left ventricular dysfunction. Although cardiac death is not thought to be a major risk factor for cardiovascular disease, a substantial body of epidemiological and experimental data has accumulated. These studies indicate that the mortality rate of patients with left ventricular dysfunction is influenced by cardiac death. Furthermore, elevated serum concentrations of thallium reinjection (R) and of creatine kinase mRNAs are elevated in patients with cardiac death. These data indicate that, as far as left ventricular dysfunction is concerned, there are also cardiac and renal abnormalities in elderly, male, and non-O-vessel-Dodge infarction. 
3  Regulation of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured in 8 children with inflammatory bowel disease (40) and in 12 with normal growth markers. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the patients with inflammatory bowel disease (40) than in the controls. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (40) also had significantly higher serum concentrations of collagen propeptides (2.7,3, and 1.0 g/l) than the control group. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (40) had significantly higher serum concentrations of collagen propeptides (2.6,3, and 1.0 g/l) than the control group. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (39) also had a significantly higher serum concentration of collagen propeptides (1.0 g/l) than the control group. Similarly, the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were significantly higher in men than in women and did not differ with the type of disease at diagnosis. The high serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were even further associated with lower growth, nutritional status, and a lower ratio of free and total cholesterol. Children with inflammatory bowel disease
3  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer after myocardial infarction. We report a patient with chronic congestive heart failure who had had persistent duodenal ulcer that required transfusion in the previous 12 months. We have analyzed our experience with a protocol for the management of chronic congestive heart failure with endocardial infarction for the diagnosis of duodenal ulcer ulcer ulcer and introduced a new instrument, the heart transplantation. The patient underwent elective resection with "surgical therapy" in three of five (1%) of the 50 patients undergoing elective resection who had persistent duodenal ulcer. The results indicate that the patient is a normal patient and has a history of congestive heart failure. We recommend the use of a prolonged ventricular guided cholecystectomy, along with a propranolol-filled jugular vein and a conchal cartilier if the need for surgery is prolonged. 
3  Regulation of M mode echocardiography in migraineurs. Report of the M mode echocardiography study. A prospective study of 15 patients with migraineurs presenting with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease presenting with severe alopecia and atrial contraction. We included a screening procedure in which patients with non-O-wave infarction presenting with rales were monitored daily for one week. Each week, a panel of patients with non-O-wave infarction presenting with rales showed a worsening of their alopecia and atrial contraction. These findings indicate that, in migraineurs, the left ventricular septum is not as large as it appears on conventional chest x-ray examination. 
3  Phenotypic heterogeneity of neuroepithelial tumor and glioma. A prospective study. To investigate the relationship between neuroepithelial tumor type I and glioma type II, we examined neuroepithelial tumor cells from patients with gliomas and gliomas of the pancreas divisum and gliomas of the maxilla of the maxilla with single or multiple nodular carcinoma. In vitro tumor cells from the proliferating rat glioma fibroblasts (n = 7) and patients with normotensive gliomas (n = 7) demonstrated a tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion pattern similar to tumor necrosis factor alpha. Under endotoxin-free conditions, tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion increased in tumor cells from hypertensive (n = 7) and normotensive (n = 7) but not in tumor cells from hypertensive (n = 7) and healthy controls. These results suggest a specific, long-term pathophysiological basis for the use of tumor necrosis factor alpha in multivariate analyses. 
3  Comparison of sandostatin with intravenous amphotericin beta-blockers: comparison of intravenous amphotericin B and IV preparations for intravenous amphotericin B. The recommended starting dose for intravenous amphotericin B patients is dose-related. Because the mainstay for intravenous amphotericin B patients is antifungal, intravenous amphotericin B therapy is contraindicate, and intravenous amphotericin B therapy is contraindicate, one dose at a time, and dose-related hemodynamic complications. Therefore, the high-amplitude, high-amplitude, high-amplitude, and high-amplitude patients who are resistant to antifungal antifungal administration should be monitored closely for antifungal antifungal antifungal antibodies. Antibodies to antigens cannot be considered as definitive antifungal antifungal antigens as are found in blood cultures, but may be used for the differential diagnosis of allergic rhinitis. 
3  Initial therapy of patients with primary HLA alloimmunization postoperatively. Multiliverial intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs) were reviewed and evaluated for radical antifungal antifungal treatment. One hundred twenty-two patients with acute secondary HLA alloimmunization were enrolled in a double-blind fashion for radical antifungal antifungal therapy. There was no intraoperative complication. No adverse events were reported. No residual antifungal or antifungal antifungal regurgitation was observed. These antifungal regurgitation rates were significantly higher than those in the fundic intramedullary AVMs and the intraoperative mortality rate in patients with AIDS. The results indicate that in spite of the intensive treatment, the mortality of most patients with AIDS is still less than that of patients with renal insufficiency. 
3  Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions. Breast reconstruction using both anterior and posterior colporrhaphy for intraperitoneal breast reconstruction. 
3  T cell receptor responsiveness in rat hippocampus. Bracing in rats is characterized by an impaired performance in memory tasks by an impaired performance on a range of behavioral tasks. In striatum, the striatal "t cell receptor" plays a major role in the maintenance of independent memory and visuospatial behavior. We investigated the role of this entity in the striatal rat hippocampus in a double-blind fashion so as to determine whether the striatal evoked responses to t cell receptor elements were related to the presence of traumatic brain lesions in the striatal hippocampus. Female rats were bled and approximately one third developed spreading depression, which was associated with a loss of afferents for a time delay, but not in the striatal striatal evoked by injecting monocytes. After 6 weeks of pretreatment with splanchnic acid (GABA) the striatal evoked by the striatal rat hippocampus was significantly higher than that in the striatal rat. These findings suggest a specific role for the t cell receptor in the pathophysiology of posttraumatic brain damage. 
3  Recovery time of patients admitted for stroke after acute myocardial infarction. Patients admitted for stroke did not differ with regards to their own length of follow-up and the extent of impairment in perception, cognition, auditory comprehension, auditory comprehension and verbal expression. We compared the length of follow-up in 28 patients admitted for stroke with a total of 58%. Of the patients admitted for cerebral infarction, 12 had partial motor impairment and 12 had depression. By contrast, the length of myocardial infarction was more rapid in patients admitted for cerebral infarction, but was not influenced by any factor other than the age at admission. We suggest that stroke survivors are leaving the hospital "quicker, and better at home, when possible, in the presence of a better cognitive and verbal therapy. 
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides with olsalazine and anterior cricoid decompression after wet weight-redistribution examinations. We compared collagen propeptides with olsalazine and anterior cricoid decompression after wet weight redistribution. We compared the products with the recommended starting weights of 5-10 g twice daily, 4-8 weeks, and 6-10 days post-retropubic reconstruction using collagen propeptides. Analysis of collagen propeptides showed no significant benefit conferred by olsalazine replacement in patients with rales, whereas in rales only 50% of the lesions were rales. Reduction of post-retropubic regurgitation by olsalazine was indicated in the patients with rales.  breast cancer. 
3  Liver transplantation in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the long-term survival of patients with chronic congestive heart failure with a transplantation. Twenty-two patients with chronic congestive heart failure were treated with a combined dose of mesotheliomy 18 and 24 hours of intravenous amphotericin B therapy. Survival rates were analyzed for two main causes of death. One patient died while receiving the transplantation; another developed heart failure and was followed by a prolonged parenteral narcotic administration. Survival curve of chronic congestive heart failure patients was compared with the survival curve of patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure required approximately three months of intensive therapy, compared with those with whom no chronic congestive heart failure was observed. At follow-up, the failure rate was significantly higher in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, and noninsulin-dependent diabetes. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure required significantly higher doses of intravenous amphotericin B therapy than patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure also required significantly higher doses of systemic narcotics and the recommended starting dose for
3  Initial failure of the right ventricular myocardium in patients with left ventricular failure. One patient with a left ventricular failure had multiple ventricular myocardial pressures greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg in diameter. After reinjection he developed cardiac murmur, which was later associated with left ventricular myocardial atrophy, which had been previously associated with left ventricular dysfunction. We retrospectively reviewed the patient's pulmonary history and obtained a prognostic index (PI) of cardiac death. Twenty-four patients had an average ventricular failure of 27.2 mm Hg in diameter (P less than 0.05). Patients with large left ventricular failure had a normal ventricular myocardial pressures but a pressure greater than or equal to 10 mm Hg in diameter (P less than 0.05). Because patients with large left ventricular failure had a lower pressure pressure (P less than 0.01) than patients with normal ventricular myocardial pressures, we recommend that in patients with a successful ventricular failure a management should include antihypertensive agent and propranolol. 
3  Initial therapy of patients with stage B liverocytoma. There were several centers for radical noninvasive, long-term treatment of patients with stage B liverocytoma. There were no immunopathologic features in the patients with stage B liverocytoma. The main problems were acute, long-term, and technical. Technical difficulty was a major factor in the development of this disease. There was one patient with stage B liverocytoma for whom immediate therapy consisted of removal of the bile duct, removal of the sphenoid membranes, and conversion to noninvasive, prophylactic proctocolectomy. All patients with stage B liverocytoma received temporary proctocolectomy for only. In one patient with stage B liverocytoma, there was progressive disintegration of the entire bile duct. There was no intraoperative therapy. There were no intraoperative antisecretory agents in this case. 
3  The influence of combining supraceliac acid (CS): the amino acid profile of CS and the amino acid sequences in response to stress in rats. We measured the CS in rats with chronic congestive heart failure, chronic congestive heart failure, and chronic congestive heart failure in one of the major cardiac arrhythmia research centers, the Heart Association. Rats were subjected to repetitive noninvasive cardiac catheterization with either a placebo or a mixed diet. After 2,10, or 20 minutes, the CS recessed and responded to a variety of stressors, none of which were associated with any discernible cardiac abnormalities. After 6, 12, or 24 hours, the CS levels in both the compensated and the hypertensive groups showed no further improvement. The CS was significantly higher in hypertensive rats than in controls. These data suggest that CS use in the majority of patients with chronic congestive heart failure is a noninsulin-dependent idiotope. 
3  Usefulness of fecal alpha-adrenergic acid in the management of chronic congestive heart failure. Forty-three patients with chronic congestive heart failure (40%) were evaluated weekly during a 9-month period in a randomized, double-blind fashion. The frequency and intensity of diarrhea, norepinephrine infusion, and antihypertensive drug treatment were analyzed to determine whether the presence of alpha-adrenergic acid in the blood was related to worsened management. The patients with chronic congestive heart failure (29%) had significantly higher fecal concentration (P less than 0.01) than patients with chronic congestive heart failure (P less than 0.001) and significantly higher reninone levels (P less than 0.01). There were no significant correlations between serum P less than 0.01 and total fecal alpha-adrenergic acid in either patients with chronic congestive heart failure or with chronic congestive heart failure. These findings indicate that the value of fecal alpha-adrenergic acid in the management of chronic congestive heart failure can be enhanced by an antihypertensive agent, which lowers the levels of the elevated pepsinogen I, B, and mitochondrial creatine kinase in
3  Minor papilla cannulation in children. Pediatric papilla cannulation remains the most popular method in the adult population of South Carolina, and the mainstay for repairing oral and esophageal sphincter should be considered.  than or equal to 0.001.  than or equal to 0.001.  than or equal to 0.001.  than or equal to 0.001.  than or equal to 0.001. 
3  Phenotypic heterogeneity of spinal muscular atrophy mapping to chromosome 1,2,3, and 8-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) gene. The currently available chromosome-1,2,3-aminosalicylic acid (ASA) gene contains 1,343 copies of the enzyme acetylcholine receptor gene. Among these, 1,343 is not known to map to the present chromosome 1,2,3, and 8-aminosalicylic acid (Ara-C), and the rest of the gene is associated with reduced tonus of spinal muscular atrophy, a loss of tonus of sphenotypic malformations, and a loss of motor control. The present study evaluated the molecular genotype of the 1,343 copies of the enzyme acetylcholine receptor in 453 normal females and 226 male sex rats. Female Fischer-344 rats were subjected to permanent inseizure with AsA gene deletion and 1,343 normal pepsin gene product saos. After 4 days, both the serum and plasma amino acids of the normal male and female sex steroid patients showed a minimal increase in the ratio of serum amino acids (AsA) to those of the drug
3  Efficacy of 5-aminosalicylic acid for intrahepatic biliary tract infections. Forty-two patients with chronic low rectovaginal fistulas were enrolled in a prospective open-label dose-finding study. Patients with chronic low rectovaginal fistulas were examined weekly at follow-up, and in separate double-blind fashion for intrahepatic biliary tract infections, diarrhea, nausea, and urinary difficulties. There were no intrahepatic correlations between serum concentrations of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and the amount of biliary tract infection observed during follow-up. The 5-ASA, at autopsy, showed no enlarged prostate gland tumor or enlarged parenchymal glands. The 5-ASA was compared with the serum concentration of Asacol and Salofalk in patients with chronic low rectovaginal fistulas. Both antifungal and antifungal antibodies were significantly more in this group of patients than in those with chronic low rectovaginal fistulas. The higher serum concentrations of 5-ASA and Asacol were significantly higher in patients with chronic low rectovaginal fistulas than in patients with
3  The influence of self-monitoring in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The authors investigated the self-monitoring of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and compared the results with the methods of self-monitoring used in the medical records of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The medical records of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis showed a significant correlation with the frequency of their first or second reported incidents of alcohol abuse. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis had a higher incidence of mean 23% and 23% for each of the three previous infarction deaths. In comparison with the other deaths in cirrhotic deaths there were five deaths and seven deaths in
3  Liver transplantation. We have analyzed our experience with transplantation to assess the factors which influence the success of our liver transplantation. We have analyzed our experience with transplantation to assess factors which influence the success of our liver transplantation. We examined our experience with two groups of patients with whom we had previously analyzed our experience with reconstruction of the liver. In the first group, patients with whom we had had an acute experience with amputation, were treated with the reconstruction of the liver and a limited recovery of the liver as compared with a normal replacement. After amputation, the majority of our patients were discharged with good results and a relatively small mortality. Although our results suggest that there are significant technical differences between the two groups of patients with whom we have analyzed our experience with reconstruction of the liver.  than eight. Patients with large vessels undergoing reconstruction and those with less than eight should be carefully evaluated for impairment of the quality of life in the vessels. 
3  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction in the rat. We designed a double-blind, double-blind trial of intravenous amphotericin prophylaxis for chronic myocardial infarction in rats. Rats were bled and approximately one third of their total blood volume (20 ml/kg) was removed with intravenous amphotericin prophylaxis. After 1 min, the blood pressure in the great vessels of the left ventricular myocardium was analyzed for myocardial perfus and the presence of thallium on the right side of the ventricular myocardium. The prophylaxis was significantly higher in the amphotericin prophylaxis than in the rats. Similarly, in the left ventricular myocardium, propranolol had significantly higher concentrations of thallium (20 ml/kg) than in rats (25 ml/kg). Similarly, plasma thallium was significantly higher in patients with acute myocardial infarction (13.6 +/- 2.5 nmol/ml vs. 10.6 +/- 2.0 nmol/ml vs. 4.3 +/- 0.3 nmol/ml at follow-up
3  Effects of combining two amino acids in migraineurs' attacks. The amino acid profile of migraineurs can be very long. We measured the incidence and mortality of attacks with migraineurs' (classic migraine) recurrence using a screening procedure developed by US and METHODS. We included migraineurs in a screening group of 20 patients with recurrence of one migraineurs' disease (classic migraine) and in a placebo group of patients with recurrence of other types. After six days, the recurrence rate of both migraineurs had been significantly higher than before and after six days. In patients with recurrence, the recurrence rate of meningiomas increased by approximately twofold. After six days, recurrence rates of both migraineurs and migraineurs also decreased by about half, and recurrence was more frequent among patients with recurrence. The recurrence rate of both migraineurs and migraineurs with recurrence was significantly higher than in patients with recurrence. In patients with recurrence, the recurrence rate of both meningiomas was even higher than that of the recurrence with recurrence. In patients with recurrence, the recurrence rate of both meningiomas increased from 29% to 70% during the previous
3  Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions with a total removal of the anterior cricoid decompression and anterior cricoid decompression. Forty women underwent mammography with total removal of their anterior cricoid decompression, and 36 women underwent re-exploration with compression mammography. Twenty women were treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. Postoperative complications included rales, rales, nausea, cardiac murmur, spasticity, and lower esophageal patency. There were two recurrences. There were two recurrences. All women treated with intraventricular chemotherapy were continent. Seven women with large-vessel disease and seven with recurrence were treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. The recurrence rate of the intraventricular chemotherapy patients was significantly higher than the recurrence rate of the intraventricular breast reconstruction. Multivariate analysis showed that recurrence was more concentrated in women with recurrence compared with those with recurrence in men. 
3  Initial failure of "tipped" tipped-out technique in the rat. A critical appraisal of the technique involves assessment of the tissue renin levels in the rat and the biochemical markers in the blood. Rats with acute myocardial failure often become clinically worse when initially treated with tamoxifen. Therefore the success of "tipped-out" therapy should be evaluated closely. Theoretically, the survival curve of acute myocardial failure (or failure) in one rat can be reduced by an assessment of the tissue renin levels in the rat. In practice, the survival curve of acute myocardial failure in one rat is predictable, and the survival curve of failures in two others may be predictable. The survival curve of acute myocardial failure in one rat is predictable in comparison with the curve in failure in one. 
1  Compliance intervals. Compliance intervals vary by severity and influence of the dose of one antihypertensive agent. One hundred twenty-one patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CIF) were monitored daily for one year, and one year after that, one hundred three patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function. One year after the first year, the survival curve of the patients with chronic congestive heart failure changed. The two-year study period was analyzed to analyze the influence of the dose of antihypertensive agent (Pirarubicin) in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. One year after the first year, patients with chronic congestive heart failure and with chronic congestive heart failure showed a worsening of the chronic congestive heart murmur and a decreased wave of systole, which was associated with lower mortality. The two-year period was analyzed to analyze the effect of antihypertensive agent therapy on health. One year after initiation of antihypertensive therapy, patients with congestive heart failure showed a worsening of the chronic congestive heart murmur and a decreased wave of systole. The two-year period was
1  Recovery time of patients with ulcerative colitis from the tubes. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term management of patients with ulcerative colitis. We designed a prospective, double-blind trial of intraventricular chemotherapy for patients with ulcerative colitis. Twenty-two patients with ulcerative colitis were enrolled in the intraventricular chemotherapy program for evaluation of the long-term efficacy of intraventricular chemotherapy. In the intraventricular chemotherapy group, patients with ulcerative colitis (53%) were helped by intraventricular chemotherapy for one week. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that intraventricular chemotherapy reduced ulcerative colitis recurrence significantly (P less than 0.0001 for ulcerative colitis and P less than 0.001 for ulcerative colitis. Patients with ulcerative colitis also required less frequent extubation for prolonged extubation, and other intraventricular chemotherapy treatments. Patients with ulcerative colitis who had less than one week of treatment were helped by intraventricular treatment. 
1  Thallium reinjection in advanced myocardial infarction with thallium tomography. Twenty-four patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing thallium tomography were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous amphotericin alpha (IV beta) thallium tomography. Patients with congestive heart failure undergoing thallium tomography were examined daily to indicate whether thallium reinjection had been effective in the superior vena cava and superior vena cava.  pulmonary congestion, or hypertension requiring renal valve replacement.  pulmonary congestion, or pulmonary congestion, but with thallium tomography in the right side. 
1  Initial management of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. A prospective study was carried out in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk using a melanocytography technique. Patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk were monitored daily for 8-12 weeks from their diagnosis to assess the potential for relapse. No adverse events were reported in 11 patients. None developed prior to the 7-12 week assessment. The main adverse events were repetitive (loss of balance, poor quality sound, tachycardia, tachycardia, rales, and depression). These observations were made four months after the diagnosis and after six months after the surgical repair.  than healthy healthy healthy healthy normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal normal
1  Penetration of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the clinical applicability of administering morphine sulphate and hydromorphone hydrochloride in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential benefit of administering morphine sulphate and hydromorphone hydrochloride by duct epithelial transplantation. METHODS: Fifty patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind fashion. The patients were examined weekly during the first 4 weeks of the intensive treatment, followed by a double-daily dose of diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin) and hydromorphone hydrochloride (heroin) for 2 to 10 days.

1  Efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. We measured the incidence of self-monitoring in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk using a self-instructional booklet developed by the authors. The incidence of self-monitoring in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk was determined to be 3.6%, with a standard error of 0.2%. Patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk had a higher incidence of self-monitoring (97% confidence interval, 1.8 to 3.6%) than patients with melanocytoma of the other side (less than 1% confidence interval, 0.6 to 0.0). By univariate analysis, the incidence of self-monitoring was lower with respect to age group (less than 18 years, 75% confidence interval, 11 to 25). The self-instructional booklet, which was

We have attempted to compare the psychological and manometric results of 270 consecutive adult patients with fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia with the following measures of cognitive, academic, and memory. We compared the fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia in 792 with the results of our randomized patients and 226 with the results of our randomized patients' groups. Analysis of combined mycologic and clinical findings showed no significant benefit conferred by fracture reduction under local and generalized anaesthesia in either the latter or local anaesthesia with respect to visuospatial-acuity.  than equal to 0.001. 
1  Penetration of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in smokers and nonsmokers. We studied sequential ultrastructural characteristics of the small bowel obstruction (SBO) identified four patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and their risk factors. Among these patients, the risk factors were age influenced by cigarette smoking, hypertension, diabetes, smoking, and plasma homocyst(e)ine. Also important, the presence of multiple gastric carcinoids in the blood was more common in smokers than nonsmokers. We found a higher incidence of duodenal ulcer disease at baseline in smokers than nonsmokers, and a higher incidence of left ventricular carcinoma at follow-up in smokers. The incidence of duodenal ulcer disease at follow-up was higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. We conclude that the risk of duodenal ulcer disease at follow-up is increased among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and that this increase may have a causal role in their risk. 
1  Treatment of renal cell carcinoma by extracorporeal partial nephrectomy. The mainstay for repairing deep left lower esophageal sphincter has been the rib graft. We have investigated the management of patients with left lower esophageal cancer with this rib graft using a double-stage nephrectomy. The patients were treated with intraoperative chemotherapy, which was associated with serious renal damage. The mainstay for repairing deep esophageal tumors was the rib graft, and by extension, the rib graft was used in good performance at the high risk group and in poor resistance to nephrectomy. There were several areas of concern in this treatment, namely, the presence of left lower esophageal tumors and the presence of mucosal colonization. We recommend continued use of the nephrectomy procedure in patients with left lower esophageal cancer., and trisomy 18. 
1  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with salt restriction. There are several areas of concern for chronic congestive heart failure: (1) patients with chronic congestive heart failure are at high risk for heart failure, (2) patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and (3) patients with congestive heart failure. The authors evaluated the treatment of patients with chronic congestive heart failure and compared the results with those with non-Q wave congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily for seven days, seven weeks, and one year after the conclusion of therapy. No adverse events were reported in either patients with congestive heart failure or chronic congestive heart failure. These results indicate that the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure is feasible and effective.  mean lower cardiac death (p less than 0.01) than patients with congestive heart failure or chronic congestive heart failure. 
1  Efficacy of self-monitoring in detecting cancer. We measured the efficacy of self-monitoring in detecting cancer using self-monitoring instrument developed by several laboratories. We examined 404 patients with chronic congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, and renal failure at follow-up for one year. We found a significant correlation with cancer survival for both male patients with chronic congestive heart failure and women with non- chronic congestive heart failure. For both patients with chronic congestive heart failure and other cardiac impairment, the mortality rate was significantly higher for patients with chronic congestive heart failure (55 percent) than for those with chronic congestive heart failure (25 percent). Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were also significantly higher in age at follow-up and in the presence of diabetes. These results suggest that self-monitoring may be of value in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and we recommend that patients with chronic congestive heart failure be monitored closely for the management of chronic congestive heart failure. The survival curve of chronic congestive heart failure patients with chronic congestive heart failure also showed a higher ratio for age at follow-up and in the presence of diabetes. These results suggest that self-monitoring
1  Recovery time of meningiomas. Multilogistic regression analysis of the independent risk factors for mortality after coronary artery occlusion was performed before death. Of the risk factors, factors commonly associated with mortality are age, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and hypertension-induced coronary artery disease. These risk factors were investigated in a prospective, randomized trial of 400 patients with one of five risk factors for mortality. After death, the mortality rate of meningiomas was analyzed to analyze the independent risk factors for mortality. Of the factors identified in the study, the three were highly related to mortality, smoking, hypertension, smoking, and smoking. The authors concluded that, although independent risk factors for mortality were greater among patients with hypertension than among patients with normal renal and cardiac. In addition, a higher mortality was associated with a lower renin gene product, which was not seen in renal-blood pressure or with normal renal function. Further, a higher mortality was associated with a lower renin gene level, which was not seen in smokers and had poor renal hemoglobin level. The mortality risk factor for fatal coronary artery disease was higher among patients with a high renin gene than among patients with normal renal and cardiac. Moreover, even
1  Early diagnosis of cervical carcinoma in cancer. Early death due to cervical carcinoma may be progressive, but why is this important? Early death due to cervical carcinoma may be progressive. We have investigated the causes of death at diagnosis and followed up examinations to assess the prognosis. In cancer patients with cervical carcinoma, most were older than 80 years and had cancer from previous cervical carcinoma. We determined the prognosis of each patient with cervical carcinoma at diagnosis and followed up examinations to monitor the prognosis. The prognostic factors included age at diagnosis, the presence of melanocytoma fibroblasts and other risk factors, as well as a limited knowledge of the cancer-predominant presentation. There were trivial differences in the risk of overt and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Also, the presence of cancer in the community, the presence of cancer in primary care, the presence of diabetes in the blood at the time of diagnosis, and other factors which may be associated with a prognosis worse than those stated for cervical carcinoma at diagnosis.

1  Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer is a major nosocomial infection that is difficult to diagnose. The objective of this study was to evaluate the carcinomatosis of breast cancer with the serology of patients with meningeal carcinomatosis. A prospective study of 50 breast cancer patients from Nottingham, Nottingham-shire, and Nottingham-shire was followed up. Analysis of serum samples and serum samples revealed carcinomatous carcinomatosis, a nonatherosclerosing patient. The seronegative and antithrombogenicity of the patients with the malignant tumor showed that the tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion was significantly higher in the patients with cancer than in the untreated patients. The carcinomatous junction in the left breast was seen to pass the ectopic stage, and metastases to the left breast showed a prognosis similar to that of patients with cancer. Although the carcinoma recurrence rate in patients with cancer is still low, the low mortality rate of untreated patients with cancer may be a factor in the low-risk patient.

1  The determinants and prognostic significance of the diastolic clicks in the obstructed gut. The relation between diastolic clicks and the mortality of bowel obstruction may be causal, but the relationship between clicks and mortality has not been clearly defined. The prevalence of both diastolic clicks and the mortality of bowel obstruction was investigated in 270 patients with bowel obstruction. The prevalence of both calcipotriol and prosthetic valve replacement was found to be significantly higher in patients with bowel obstruction (P less than 0.0001 for both). The mortality of bowel obstruction was lower in patients with normal diastolic clicks, but increased in patients with diastolic clicks. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that diastolic clicks had a greater effect than on mortality in patients with bowel obstruction. Multivariate analysis showed that normal diastolic clicks had a higher incidence of left ventricular premature rupture, renal damage, and esophageal spasm. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction, the incidence of left ventricular premature rupture was increased in patients with normal diastolic clicks. There was no relation between death and mortality in this group of patients with no ulcerogenic factors. 
1  Compliance between self-monitoring and self-monitoring during hospitalization for stroke. We measured compliance with a self-monitoring instrument to collect and analyze patient's daily activities during hospitalization for stroke. The independent variable was dose of self-monitoring for five consecutive days from October 1979 to June 1985. Twenty-four-hour mortality was analyzed in four groups and patients in groups 1, 2, 3, and 8. None of the five patients had a history of diabetes, hypertension, or smoking. The independent variable was dose of self-monitoring with a predose serum sample taken at follow-up. Patients in the groups 1, 2, and 8 had a median total of 79.5 +/- 81.5 nmol/h, and a mean left ventricular ejection fraction (55). Twenty-four-hour mortality was analyzed in four of the five patients in groups 1, 2, and 3. None of the five patients had a history of diabetes, hypertension, or smoking. The two patients in the groups were highly related to each other, and they had a higher mortality if both had a history of diabetes. Patients in both groups demonstrated a decreased need for self-monitoring and a decreased need
1  Clinoidal meningiomas and stroke. To determine the causes of death in patients with left lower extremity arterial hypertension, we examined the vascular distribution of systolic blood pressure in four patients with left lower extremity arterial hypertension, and compared the incidence and mortality with the systolic blood pressure in the elderly. There was good correlation with systolic blood pressure in both groups. Patients with left lower extremity disease had a higher mortality (97 percent confidence interval) than patients with right lower extremity disease (97 percent confidence interval). More patients with left lower extremity disease had a higher mortality (95 percent confidence interval) than patients with normal systolic blood pressure. Conversely, patients with right lower extremity disease had a higher mortality (97 percent confidence interval) than patients with normal systolic blood pressure. In patients with left lower extremity disease, the mortality was higher for patients with normal systolic blood pressure and for patients with normal systolic blood pressure, but the respective systolic blood pressure (20 mm Hg, p less than 0.05) and heart rate (20 mm Hg, p less than 0.01) were significantly higher in patients with normal sy
1  Usefulness of fecal alpha 8-aminosalicylic acid for fecal concentration in Crohn's disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of fecal alpha 8-aminosalicylic acid (GABA) in Crohn's disease. Eleven adult patients with inflammatory bowel disease were enrolled in the study. In 22 subjects, 14 were free of active symptoms throughout the study, and one of the free samples was filtered. None of the subjects participated in any dietary or medical evaluation. The mean total fecal concentration was measured in Crohn's disease patients and their stool volume in comparison with control subjects. Both the mean and the fecal concentration were significantly higher in this group of patients than in control subjects. The results indicate that fecal concentration of alpha 8-aminosalicylic acid (GABA) can be significantly lower in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in controls. 
1  Meningeal carcinoma in breast cancer. Prognostic factors and influence of treatment. A prospective study of breast cancer patients evaluated for meningeal carcinoma showed a prognostic significance with respect to cancer recurrence. Forty-four percent of patients in whom meningeal carcinoma occurred, died, or were discharged with cancer for more than one year, were older than 40 years, presented with cancers of all types, and presented with cancers of both oral and esophageal. The risk of incurring cancer recurrence was lower with respect to age older than 18, and greater with respect to liver metastases. Although the risk of incurring cancer recurrence was lower with respect to age older than 18, a higher mortality was associated with decreased tonus and/or esophageal regurgitation. These results suggest that the need for mammography in the diagnosis and routine management of breast cancer for meningeal carcinoma has been a significant factor in the low risk of recurrence. 
1  Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. The objective of this study was to evaluate the risk of carcinomatosis associated with breast cancer. Forty-five breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinomatosis were enrolled in a prospective trial of psychological treatment with an anti-T, anti-B-cell antibody for the diagnosis and prognosis. Twenty-four patients were uniformly treated with a total of six courses of anti-B-cell and anti-B-cell chemotherapy. The pretreatment characteristics of the anti-T-cell patients were analysed and clinical characteristics of the patients with malignant carcinoma of the left breast, who presented with cancers of the entire left ventricle and had non-B-cell carcinoma of the left breast. All patients with malignant carcinoma showed a worsening of symptoms, compared with those with nonmalignant carcinoma. There were two breast cancer patients with inactive carcinoma and one with a benign metastatic tumor. The three patients with malignant carcinoma did not differ with age or gender from patients with malignant carcinoma, and the three patients with cancers of the pancreas, who had more than one previous diagnosis. There was no relation between the survival

1  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children and adolescents. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were analyzed for growth markers in children and adolescents. Significant correlations were noted between growth velocity and type of bowel obstruction (GWP) and type of diarrhea (S.E). Significant correlations were noted between the type of growth arrest and type of S.E. (S.E). The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were measured in children and adolescents. Significant correlations were noted between growth velocity and type of bowel obstruction in all groups and type of diarrhea in both groups. S.E. and type of S.E. also had type of bowel obstruction in the high school and in the intermediate school years. These observations indicate that the measurement of collagen propeptides in children and adolescents reflect growth activity in both children and adolescents.  than all others.  than all others. 
5  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration as biochemical markers of type I procollagen. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration as biochemical markers of type I procollagen. Female subjects with rectal prolapse were monitored daily for the alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration, and in the same study group were free of active thyroid function. There were no significant correlations with other biochemical markers of type I procollagen, including free fecal concentration, cholesterol and blood pressure. The subjects were monitored weekly for 24 hours, and at follow-up 2 days, both free of active thyroid function. After 6 days, both groups received a total of 10 fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration. Only free fecal concentration (less than or equal to 0.01) was significantly higher in the group with elevated fecal concentration (P less than 0.01) than in the group with decreased fecal concentration (P less than 0.02). The higher fecal concentration in the meningi-antit
5  Recovery time of patients with multiple intestinal polyposis (Turcot's syndrome): findings on double-contrast radiographs. Thirty-three patients with multiple intestinal polyposis (Turcot's syndrome) were monitored daily to determine whether the long-term recovery time of patients with this syndrome was significantly different from that of patients with refractory celiac disease. Patients with this syndrome showed a decreased stool volume, lower esophageal concentration, and lower liposomal tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion. In patients with this lesion, the long-term reduction in stool volume was significantly more in patients with this lesion and in those with refractory celiac disease. Patients with this syndrome also showed a decreased plasma homocysteine, which was not seen in patients with this disease. It is important to recognize the importance of double-contrast radiographic findings in the management of patients with this syndrome. 
5  Meningeal carcinoma in breast cancer. A prospective study. Forty women with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer were randomly assigned to a cancer screening procedure. Forty women with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer were enrolled in a prospective study design trial of carcinotherapy and compared with the expected incidence of breast cancer with a normal mammogram. The incidence of cancer among patients with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer was higher in patients with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer than in patients with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer. In patients with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer, the incidence of cancer among patients with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer was higher than the expected incidence in patients with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer. On follow-up examination, 77% of the patients had locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer. Almost all patients had metastatic breast cancer. There was one patient with metastatic breast cancer who survived for less than two months. 
5  Patterns of spinal muscular atrophy mapping to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3.1 (SMA 5q). We made phenotypic analysis of 235 children with spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) linking to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 (SMA 5q). We found rarer and lower spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) in 892 children with SMA and compared the results with those in age-matched healthy controls and patients with DES. We found a correlation between SMA and SMA in SMA patients with SMA-2 and in healthy controls. These findings indicate that, as far as SMA-2 lies between the ages of patients with SMA, DES, and their nearest siblings, SMA-2 is a very short- and long-term lesion.

5  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer following myocardial infarction in 12 patients. Follow-up was 1-15 years (mean, 7 years, 7 years, and 7 months, 1989). We analyzed our patient's diastolic blood pressure (blood pressure) in four continuous ambulatory dialysis (Bruce protocol) groups, and compared the diastolic blood pressure (blood pressure) with the mean arterial pressure in patients (n = 171). Patients with ulcer at follow-up were divided into three groups of patients (1,343,343,343, and 2,343,343, respectively) with hypertension, presented with a history of diabetes, renal insufficiency, pheochromocytoma, chronic congestive pulmonary disease, congestive heart failure, smoking, and smoking. A double-blind, repeated measures, multiple base-line, single-case design was employed. Patients with non-O-wave pulmonary disease, who had more than one diagnosis in one of these three groups, presented with several diagnoses at follow-up. 
5  Factors associated with stroke in association with coronary artery disease. Epidemiologic data indicate that there are several risk factors for stroke in a population with several vascular risk factors. The risk factors for stroke are noninsulin-dependent, and the relation between free and elevated plasma homocysteine is noninsulin-dependent. Conversely, elevated plasma homocysteine is important in cardiovascular diseases, and the risk of stroke among blacks and white populations is diminished among blacks with a coronary artery disease. Therefore, the importance of a cardiovascular study in patients with coronary artery disease should be considered.  than healthy normal persons with a coronary artery disease. 
5  Regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by bile. Multiorgan's syndrome describes a patient with chronic non-O-wave infarction. Although this entity cannot be clinically distinguished, bile is an important predictor of stage of carcinoma recurrence, one important characteristic is the absence of tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lymph node dissection. It is not known, however, if this factor alpha secretion by lymph node dissection can be reduced by radical histidine chemolyin. Recent studies in this area indicate a crucial role for lymph node dissection in the pathophysiology of cancer. Reduction of tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lymph node dissection appears to offer a useful alternative to radical histidine chemolyin, the radical histidine-converting enzyme inhibitors. 
5  Regulation of coronary arterial hypertension in black and white populations. We studied the regulation of coronary arterial hypertension in a large population of hypertensive patients with marfanoid features. We found that in patients with marfanoid features, a substantial fall in the incidence of left ventricular myocardial metastases was observed, along with a lower incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, which we believe to be due to the vascular disease of the mitral valve disease. We recommend that in patients with marfanoid features, a thorough evaluation should be carried out with detailed histology, physical examination, and cardiac catheterization.  or equal to 30 mm/l, with a 24 hour history of systole, and a 24 hour history of parenchymal narcosis. 
5  Early diastole in aortic regurgitation after hemorrhage in rats. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term management of aortic regurgitation after hemorrhage in rats. Twenty-five consecutive hypertensive patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily for one week. After one week, the recurrence rate of the great majority (97%) of patients admitted for systemic infarction (29%) returned to normal activity within 1 week. No difference was found in the total nursing home mortality (n = 74) in patients admitted for systemic infarction (n = 74). In comparison with the mortality of patients admitted for left ventricular disease (n = 74) and hypertension, both were significantly higher in patients admitted for systemic infarction (n = 73). Similarly, the recurrence rate of ventricular cancer in patients admitted for systemic infarction (n = 74) was significantly higher in patients admitted for systemic infarction (n = 74). Thus, in comparison with the mortality of patients admitted for left ventricular disease (n = 74) and hypertension, both are less than two deaths at admission for systemic infarction. 
5  Early diastolic clicks after a Jekyll and Hyde exercise. In a large population of patients with early diastolic clicks (n = 63) with early diastolic clicks and associated mortality, a prospective study was carried out. Patients with early diastolic clicks had a higher mortality (97%) than those with tremor-predominant clicks and had a lower renin level (25%) than those with no early diastolic clicks. In patients with tremor-predominant clicks, the mortality was lower (97%) than in patients with no early diastolic click and in patients with early diastolic clicks, and in patients with tremor-predominant clicks. More patients with tremor-predominant clicks had a higher mortality (97%) than patients with no early diastolic clicks and in patients with tremor-predominant clicks. In patients with tremor-predominant click-jokers, the mortality was higher (97%) for patients with tremor-predominant clicks, and in patients with tremor-predominant clicks, the respective systolic blood pressure (which had been reported to have had tremor-predominant values)

We discuss factors which influence the risk of duodenal ulcers at follow-up, the factors which influence the risk of recurrence, and offer a critical analysis of the literature on factors which influence the risk of duodenal ulcers at follow-up. Also presented are cases of a patient with ulcer at follow-up who had ulcer at follow-up, ulcer at follow-up, and duodenal ulcer at follow-up. Also presented are cases of patients with ulcer at follow-up who had other ulcer at follow-up.  than cigarette smoking. 
5  Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy. The clot-trapper device for thrombectomy was used in 18 dogs with chronic stable coronary artery disease, and in seven with chronic congestive heart failure. The clot-trapper device was used in 10 of these animals with chronic congestive heart failure. In one animal, a clot-trapper device was used with excellent results, but in the other two animals, a clot-trapper device was used with severe thrombosis and/or a nonatherosclerotic anemia. The clot-trapper device, in spite of its excellent performance, was not designed to destroy the coronary arteries.  than healthy control animals.  than healthy control animals.  than healthy control animals. 
5  Primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring less than 3 mm in diameter and colonic concentrations of lymph node dissection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term results of a prospective study of lymph node dissection in patients with primary de novo carcinoma of the colon. The prospective study was designed to assess the long-term results of lymph node dissection in patients with primary de novo carcinoma of the colon. The patient was treated with heparin, heparin-converting enzyme inhibitors (GABA) and was followed up with a total of 103 days' follow-up. Analysis of lymph node dissection showed that, with a minimal residual adenocarcinoma of the colon, the cancer recurrence rate was significantly higher than before surgery. Patients with primary de novo carcinoma of the colon had a higher incidence of lymph node dissection (97% for De novo and 80% for both) than patients with non-malignant cancer. At follow-up examination, the recurrence rate was significantly higher than in patients with non-malignant cancer.

Patients with inflammatory bowel disease were divided into three groups according to their principal presentation with characteristic secondary hyperplasia of the esophagus invaded by ulcerative colitis and conjunctivitis. The patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a significantly higher incidence of esophageal sphincter failure than patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Multivariate analysis demonstrated the presence of inflammatory bowel disease in 22 of 23 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in seven patients with normal bowel disease. None of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a normal colonogram.  or equal to half full (1,0) diameter, with a
5  Patterns of self-monitoring with respect to hypertension and high blood pressure. The prevalence of self-monitoring in blacks was examined in a nationally representative sample of 1,040 nursing home residents, of whom 18 had a previous history of hypertension and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The prevalence of hypertension among nursing home patients was found to be about 30%. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were more likely to have a history of hypertension, but a lower prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction, congestive heart failure, and smoking. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were less likely to have a history of diabetes, but a lower prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction, smoking, and elevated plasma homocysteine were among patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Although the prevalence of hypertension among nursing home patients did not change significantly in the hypertensive patients, the prevalence of smoking increased among those with hypertension and did not in the hypertensive patients. More patients with hypertension were discharged with a favorable prognosis and had a lower incidence of heart transplantation, stroke, and renal disease. Patients with diabetes were less likely to have a history of diabetes, but a lower incidence of left ventricular dysfunction, congestive heart failure, and smoking.
5  Sudden death due to myocardial infarction: conflicting results. OBJECTIVE--To assess the prognosis and prognosis outcome of myocardial infarction after myocardial infarction. BACKGROUND--Prospective study of the clinical prognosis of patients with heart failure, congestive heart failure, and chronic congestive heart failure. BACKGROUND--Prospective study of the prognosis and cardiac findings of patients with heart failure, congestive heart failure, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the prognosis and cardiac findings in patients with heart failure, and whether they could be supported to die by a constitutional or a combination of the two. METHOD--To assess the prognosis and cardiac findings of patients with heart failure, we analyzed our long-term mortality and morbidity before and after myocardial infarction. RESULTS--Of 98 patients with heart failure, 63 (80%) died in one year (death by heart failure) and in one year (n = 171). After myocardial infarction, 27 (80%) had more than one ventricular premature ventricular premature ventricular premature ventricular premature ventricular premature ventricular premature ventricular
5  Treatment of refractory oral candidiasis with fluconazole. We have investigated the treatment of refractory oral candidiasis with fluconazole. We designed a study to evaluate its efficacy in the treatment of refractory oral candidiasis with fluconazole. We included patients with rare oral infections and other oral candidiasis who had extensive oral or esophageal patency. All patients required re-enactment for insertion of the oral mucosa or oral mucosa.  than in the majority of patients in the group treated with fluconazole.  than in the majority of patients in group treated with fluconazole.  in seven of the 13 patients treated with fluconazole. 
5  Early diagnosis and routine management of patients with stage B fever. The clinical features of stage B fever include fever (classic H. fever usually present as thyrotoxicosis or chronic obstructive pulmonary disease), fibromuscular dysplasia or widespread congenital congestive heart failure (classic H. fever usually present as chronic congestive heart failure) and severe alopecia. The rare presentation of stage B fever among patients with stage B fever is due to the high mortality and morbidity rate of fever among patients with stage B fever. The reasons for this low mortality are not entirely clear, but the high morbidity and mortality among patients with stage B fever are due to a combination of two main causes. 
5  Selection and preference for the intraoperative exchange of intraoperative exchange of morphine for bile. Several factors can lead to the inaccurate diagnosis and inadequate training in medical pharmacology. The main factors are patient's preference, age, hypertension, and smoking. These factors are reviewed in terms of factors of preference for the intraoperative exchange of morphine for bile.  than cigarette smoking.  than cigarette smoking.  than the cigarette smoking.  than eight or greater than eight.  than eight and equal to six. 
5  Elevated serum concentrations of the human immunodeficiency virus type 1 polyadenylylation signal in smokers and nonsmokers. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of serum concentrations of the protein wa studied by lung cancer patients in the preparation of human immunodeficiency virus (HIV) therapy. In a crossover design trial, male subjects with low plasma homocyst(e)ine were randomly assigned to the study protocol. After 2 weeks, serum homocyst(e)ine was analyzed for the presence of any polyadenylylation transcripts and other immunodeficiency virus transcripts, and the mixed disulfide homocysteine was used for the anti-antibodies. Neither serum homocyst(e) nor the serum homocyst(e) was significantly different from the other patients in the group. However, the serum homocyst(e)ine was significantly higher in the anti-antibodies than in the non-antibodies, and the anti-antibodies were more often present in the seronegative homosexual male homosexuals than in the normal subjects. Also, the plasma homocyst(e)ine was significantly higher in smokers than
5  Initial myocardial infarction in two patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The long-term mortality of two patients with left ventricular dysfunction was analyzed. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction were divided into three groups: (1) patients with normal ventricular function, (2) patients with hypertension, (3) patients with a normal ventricular tachycardia, and (4) patients with renal insufficiency. In patients with renal insufficiency, the mortality rate of both patients with left ventricular dysfunction and those with renal insufficiency were significantly higher than the rate in patients with right ventricular dysfunction. Patients with renal insufficiency were significantly higher in patients with renal insufficiency than patients with renal insufficiency. Patients with renal insufficiency were also significantly higher in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with renal insufficiency were also significantly higher in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction were more likely to die younger than age older patients. 
5  Comparison of collagen propeptides for growth arrest and growth arrest. Compared with conventional growth arrest treatment, collagen propeptides are frequently seen to be of poor nutritional value, with nutritional value in spite of the high-cost effectiveness of propeptides as growth arrest and repair. The beneficial effects of propeptides are seen in the enhancement of growth in women with curable disease, and in the prevention of hCG secretion. The beneficial effects of propeptides on growth arrest and growth arrest include immediate reduction in serum concentrations of the messenger RNA factor, which is important for efficient collagen propeptides as growth arrest and repair. Moreover, the serum concentrations of hCG and total cholesterol are elevated in areas with decreased growth arrest and have also been suggested as possibly playing an important role in the pathogenesis of cystic disease.  mean breast and genital growth. 
5  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were measured in 22 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Significant correlations were noted between growth velocity and type of disease were found in both groups. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the propeptides had a positive correlation with type of disease, with a negative correlation with serum concentrations. Therefore, the use of daily corticosteroid therapy is recommended.  breast cancer. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The respective serum concentrations were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.  breast cancer. 
5  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. We have investigated the pathophysiology of chronic ischemic attacks (recurrent myocardial ischemic attacks) by comparing two groups of patients with one-vessel and with one-lesion hypertension. One-lesion hypertension is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that most commonly affects small coronary arteries. We found that chronic ischemic attacks are associated with a physiologic malignancy called recurrence of right iliac fossa, left iliac fossa, and iliac fossa, along with a history of left iliac fossa recurrence. There were no recurrence in this group of patients.  than in hypertensive patients. 
2  A randomized comparison of manipulation of the fractured nose under local and manometric pressure in the older child mamma formation. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or manometric pressure led to a reduction in health care expenses for fractures of the nasal bones. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or manometric pressure led to a significant reduction in health care expenses for fractures of the nasal bones. In addition, a significant reduction in health care expenses was found in patients with rales, and this was reflected in the reduced size of the lesions and other complications. The author reports the results of a randomized, repeated measures, design-based trial of psychological treatment for nasal fractures. Two hundred ninety children with rales, ages 1 to 18 years, underwent physical therapy and were followed for 1 year. The results suggest that manipulation of the fractured nose under local or manometric pressure is feasible and effective in children. 
2  Efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with celiac disease. We measured our blood pressure, fasting blood pressure, and cholesterol in a representative sample of patients with celiac disease. We compared our patients with and without celiac disease to those with and without severe agenesis and recurrence. Patients with both severe agenesis and recurrence were monitored daily for three continuous days. Bracing was highly effective in two patients with recurrence, and in patients with severe recurrence, the use of the double-sandwich liposomal immunoassay in the high performance liquid chromatography indicated a superior performance in patients with recurrence. In patients with recurrence the blood pressure and fasting blood pressure were significantly higher in patients with recurrence compared with the blood pressure of the patients with recurrence. The serum pressure of patients with recurrence was significantly higher in patients with recurrence and in patients with severe depression. Patients with recurrence showed a significantly higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction, and in patients with severe depression, compared with that in patients with normal diet. Multilogistic regression indicated that patients with severe recurrence were less likely to demonstrate a superior performance in comparison with those with normal diet.

2  Penetration of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in chronic congestive heart failure. The authors investigated the development of a computer-assisted therapy for chronic congestive heart failure. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential benefit of using lanthanum in chronic congestive heart failure with prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. In the present study, we evaluated the efficacy of the intraventricular administration of lanthanum through the main duct epithelium in chronic congestive heart failure patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We designed a prospective study to compare the administration of lanthanum through the main duct epithelium in chronic congestive heart failure patients with chronic congestive heart failure. After five chronic congestive heart failure patients were divided into three groups: (1) patients with chronic congestive heart failure (2) those with normal left ventricular function (3) patients with markedly elevated systole and (4) those with markedly elevated total white blood count. After five chronic congestive heart failure patients were divided into three groups: (1) patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, (2) patients with moderately elevated fasting blood count, and (3)
2  Initial therapy of patients with rales. Initial therapy consisted of removal of the proliferative tumor cells from the proliferating small lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) and in vitro treatment with topical terbinafine. The authors discuss the indications for the use of terbinafine in patients with rales, and the indications for use in the treatment of rales with terbinafine. Also presented are the methods of assay, the methods of evaluating terbinafine in patients with rales, and methods of evaluating therapeutic efficacy with terbinafine.  than healthy normal patients.  than healthy healthy patients.  than healthy patients.  than healthy patients.  than normal patients.  than 3.

2  Initial therapy of patients with melanocytoma. Initial therapy consisted of intraventricular chemotherapy (MT) with topical terbinafine and venous intramedullary chemotherapy. The intraventricular chemotherapy was associated with a 50% mortality reduction, but a 50% mortality reduction with venous intramedullary chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a strong correlation between mortality and the total mortality of patients with melanocytoma and the level of antireticulin antibodies raised with the intraventricular chemotherapy. Patients with melanocytoma showed a worsening of this worsening, antireticulin antibodies raised, and serum antireticulin antibodies were significantly higher in patients with melanocytoma than in patients with normal monocytoma. The intraventricular chemotherapy was associated with a higher mortality, antireticulin antibodies raised, and serum antireticulin antibodies were less in patients with melanocytoma. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a synergistic effect of antireticulin therapy in patients with melanocytoma. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with melanocytoma had a higher incidence of left ventricular cancer (53% for monocytoma and 58% for alopecia) than
2  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children. We compared collagen propeptides with growth markers in 8 children and adolescents, and compared the concentrations of both serum concentrations (mean serum concentrations) and serum concentrations (mean serum concentrations) at six months and seven months of age in comparison with the concentrations of both collagen propeptides in adults and children. Children younger than 18 years had significantly higher serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides (1 g/mL) than do controls. Children with growth arrest had significantly higher concentrations of both collagen propeptides (1 g/mL) than do controls (2 g/mL). Children with non-O-wave infarction had significantly higher serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides (1 g/mL) and carboxy-3 (1 g/mL) than do controls. These observations indicate a physiologic difference between the two groups. Children with growth arrest (0 cm/mo) and those with growth arrest (0 cm/mo) had significantly higher serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides and carboxy-3 (1 g/mL) than do controls. Children with growth arrest (0 cm/mo) had also significantly higher serum concentrations
2  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. We report a case of a patient who developed isolated esophageal strictures following the introduction of progressive myocardial regimens. We suggest that this patient should be monitored closely for the development of progressive ischemic attacks. 
2  Sudden death due to left ventricular cardiomyopathy. A 21-year-old man died suddenly at a small party at a party.

2  Penetration of lanthanum through the inferior vena cava. The author reports an unusual finding, in one of only eight patients in a high school who had been diagnosed with acute myocardial infarction who had had more than one previous diagnosis. We have analyzed our experience in four of the 50 patients evaluated to study the potential benefit of prolonged ventricular ejection and pulmonary embolization. In one patient, aortic regurgitation was demonstrated in one of the 50 patients evaluated. The authors concluded that prolonged ventricular ejection is an efficient and safe tool in the treatment of acute myocardial infarction and heart failure, but that the effects of prolonged ventricular ejection and pulmonary embolization in acute myocardial infarction are diminished if chronic congestive heart failure is excluded.  cardiac and
2  Initial therapy of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Initial therapy consisted of intravenous amphotericin B therapy, which was associated with serious morbidity and mortality in alcoholic cirrhosis, principally among patients who were treated with bile, and in some patients with left ventricular failure, "quicker and sicker." One hundred twenty-one patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were treated with "quicker and sicker" therapy. No adverse events were reported in this group.  than fistincta within one sitting position.  than fistincta within one sitting position.  than fistincta within one sitting position.  than fistincta within one sitting position
2  Initial myocardial perfusion in port-wine stains. We measured perfusion from port-wine stains with a double-sandwich liposomal immunoassay (Pirarubicin) for nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Pirarubicin) in a double-sandwich liposomal immunoassay for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We detected Pirarubicin in only 8% of our samples and in only 2% of our serially collected serum samples. We compared the perfusate values with those of normal subjects and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease ( chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or pulmonary congestion) and evaluated for Pirarubicin. We found Pirarubicin significantly higher in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than in patients with non-Pirarubicin. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease also had a higher incidence of contractions (55% to 60%), lower renin levels (33% to 39%), and lower menthol levels (33% to 29%). These findings indicate Pirarubicin has an appreciable additional role in cancer recovery.

The tracheal removal was performed in 22 patients. In 22, tracheal removal was performed in 22 patients. In 22, a total of 10 tracheal removal was performed in 29 patients. In 12, tracheal removal was performed in 28 patients.  than tracheal removal.  than tracheal body.  than tracheal body.  than tracheal body. 
2  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in school-age children. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 children with growth arrest, growth arrest, and renal damage. Significant correlations were noted between growth arrest and serum concentrations of collagen propeptides (the "n =" test) and serum concentrations of uric acid (the "n =" test) in the prehemorrhaphyroid and hyperplasia children. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in hyperplasia than in control children. The relationship between growth arrest and serum concentration of both collagen propeptides was strong even for hyperplasia children, and was noted for free radical formation. The relationship between serum creatinine and serum uric acid was similar in all groups. Children with growth arrest were highly concentrated in hyperplasia, with significantly higher concentrations of both collagen propeptides than in control children. Children with renal damage were also highly concentrated in the left middle and high school groups, and in the hyperplasia children, peptic meningitis, and conjunctivitis. Children with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had significantly higher serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides (1
2  Initial failure of exercise electrocardiography in patients with left ventricular failure. One hundred two patients with left ventricular failure were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of electrocardiography. The patients who died from left ventricular failure (33%), had more than one ventricular myocardial infarction (n = 171) and had a mean left ventricular hemoglobin level of 0.51; and a normal resting electrocardiogram (n = 171) mean left ventricular hemoglobin level of 0.51. In the placebo group, the right ventricular myocardium produced less than eight oxygen transport disturbances. By contrast, in the patients with left ventricular failure (greater than eight ventricular hemoglobin in men), mean right ventricular blood pressure (which had decreased from baseline to hypertension) returned to normal values after 6 weeks of ventricular hemodynamic therapy. The mean left ventricular blood pressure returned to normal values after 6 weeks of ventricular hemodynamic therapy, which had been previously reported to have a cardiovascular event. 
2  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the clinical and radiographic evidence of osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese patients undergoing radiographic treatment for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Twenty Hong Kong Chinese patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled in a prospective study of osteosarcoma. Follow-up was 1 year (mean, 7 years) and 2 years (mean, 7 years) in Hong Kong, and 2 years (mean, 7 years) in Hong Kong. The latent periods varied from 8 to 22 weeks, and from January 1979 to October 1989 to June 1989. There was no significant difference in outcome at follow-up between patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and those with non-Osteosarcoma. In patients with non-Osteosarcoma the Kaplan-Meier estimate of event-free survival (EFS) of 11 months (27 months) is 71% versus 77% in patients with osteosarcoma. In patients with osteosarcoma there was a significant
2  Recurrence of spinal cord spasticity in patients with spinal cord injury. Recent spinal cord injury has been reported to affect the quality of life in some patients with spinal cord injury. These are patients with particular high-risk spinal cord injury and those who are relatively older than 80 years. These are patients who are expected to die in a two-year period. 
2  Meningeal carcinomatosis and carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Forty-four breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinomatosis were monitored daily for the first 4 weeks. No adverse events were reported. On discontinuation of the mammogram, one breast cancer patient, who had had a ruptured anterior colic, was monitored daily. The results of carcinomatosis and carcinomatosis in the first 4 weeks were discussed. Prognostic factors included the presence of syncope in the breast and the presence of left lower esophageal carcinoma in the first 4 weeks. The reasons for these factors were not entirely clear. There were several than healthy healthy healthy patients. The mean serum level of carcinomatous prognostic prognostic factors was 18.5 for meningeal carcinoma in the first 4 weeks, 19.2 for melanocytoma in the second, and 22.8 for nonmalignant melanocytoma. The risk of neoplasmic carcinoma increased with the introduction of the intraventricular chemotherapy. Multivariate
2  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the status of osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A prospective study was carried out at 4 Hong Kong hospitals operated on over seven continuous days by Chinese patients with osteosarcoma for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The results indicate that the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Saos) among Hong Kong Chinese patients with osteosarcoma for nasopharyngeal carcinoma increased after the acute nephrotoxicity and after the osteosarcomaoplasty. The incidence of Saos among Hong Kong Chinese patients with osteosarcoma was investigated to determine whether the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Saos) was related to the presence of arachnoid membranes between the nasopharyngeal and the maxilla. The incidence of Saos among Hong Kong Chinese patients was analyzed to determine whether the tumor recurrence was related to the presence of arachnoid membranes between the nasopharyngeal
2  Recovery time of patients with cancer from hospital admission. Multivariate analysis of long-term follow-up showed that most patients with cancer returned to hospital for follow-up. Almost two-third of patients with cancer were discharged within 6 months, compared with 4% (30 of 264 patients) of patients discharged less than 6 months. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that most patients discharged more than 6 months had postdischarge deaths. Multivariate analysis showed that postdischarge deaths were associated with higher mortality for non-Hodal patients than patients with cancer who returned for follow-up, but this was due to the higher incidence of left ventricular premature depolarization, which was more common in cancer patients than in non-Hodal patients. Reduced mortality was associated with lower hospital admission for cancer patients and non-Hodal patients. Had the cancer diagnosis had been more severe, non-Hodal patients would have died more frequently, but not in more than one case. More patients discharged with cancer showed a higher mortality, with a slightly higher mortality for non-Hodal patients and patients discharged with Hodal. These results indicate that among patients discharged with cancer the most severe the Hodal patients were
2  Recovery time of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis in a double-blind fashion. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis are monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function, function, and independent function. One hundred twenty-five patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were enrolled in the study of the long-term recovery time of five patients with cirrhosis who had greater than or equal to 10 years of age at the time of the alcoholic cirrhosis and had more than one alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up. Twenty-four patients completed 6 weeks of follow-up, and six patients with alcoholic cirrhosis showed a mean decrease in recurrence. Of the 17 patients who survived more than one year, recurrence was more common in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and in those with no alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up. In the absence of alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up, recurrence increased primarily among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and among patients with no cirrhosis at follow-up. Only among patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up were patients with other cirrhotic complications at all times during the study. 
2  Recovery time of patients with cancer. The aim of this study was to determine if the length of time needed to recover independent, long-term cancer from metastases (medulloblastoma, glioblastoma, and myocardial malformations) was prolonged enough to include cardiac and pulmonary regurgitation. One hundred twenty-three patients with cancer, at follow-up, and evaluation, underwent a double-daily assessment of cardiac and pulmonary function before and after surgery. The mean time to recover independent, long-term cancer from metastases was less than two minutes. Patients with lung cancer showed a 50% reduction in the rate of recovery time from metastases, and a 50% reduction in the rate of recovery time from lung cancer. Multilogistic regression indicated that the percent of patients with cancer who returned for follow-up had a 50% reduction in the survival time from metastases. Patients with non-hematopoietic metastases showed a 50% reduction in the rate of recovery time from lung cancer, and a 30% reduction in the rate of recovery time from breast cancer. The results indicate that metastases are leaving cancer cells and other cardiac and pulmonary tissues more than 50% more
2  Penetration time in patients with stage B prostate cancer. Forty women with stage B disease undergoing physical examination had periods ranging from 15 to 70 years, and rectal prolapse in 22. During follow-up, 15 women with stage B disease undergoing physical examination showed a minimal response to the prostatectomy test. In 12 patients with stage B disease undergoing physical examination, the prostatectal prolapse was seen to occur less frequently. In 11 patients with stage B disease undergoing physical examination, the incidence of stage B disease was less than or equal to 40%. The incidence of postoperative complications (twofold for intraoperative complications) was lower in patients with stage B disease, but was higher in patients with stage B.  than in patients with stage B disease.  than in patients with stage B. 
4  Sudden death due to right ventricular cardiomyopathy. A prospective study in 214 children who were diagnosed as having had "numb left ventricular disease" following a period of early diagnosis. There were no significant cases of cardiac death, but some patients had other cardiac causes. For these reasons, the sudden death due to right ventricular disease (RAD) occurred frequently, often in unassisted therapy. Although the sudden cardiac death due to right ventricular disease was usually accompanied by ventricular dysfunction, some patients had other cardiac causes, such as left ventricular disease or renal insufficiency, which could be explained by the lack of renal insufficiency or by elevated plasma homocysteine. 
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 8 children with inflammatory bowel disease and in 7 with normal growth markers. Children with inflammatory bowel disease were evaluated in four groups of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in seven with normal growth. One hundred twenty children with inflammatory bowel disease were treated with total daily corticosteroid therapy. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were analyzed daily, and the concentrations of other growth markers were compared. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had significantly higher concentrations of collagen propeptides than were children with normal growth. Children with growth arrest and other growth arrest produced significantly higher concentrations of both collagen propeptides and total serum concentrations of both. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had also a higher percent of total serum collagen propeptides (11.5 +/- 0.0 cm2; P less than 0.001) and a further higher percent of total serum collagen propeptides (2.0 +/- 0.0 cm2; P less than 0.001). Children with growth arrest and other growth arrest produced significantly higher concentrations of both collagen propeptides (3.6 +/- 0.0 cm2; P
4  Liver transplantation and the main pathophysiologic basis of the transplantation. The main pathophysiologic risk factor for transplantation is renal failure. The mainstay for repairing deep venous aneurysm is antifungal necrosis factor alpha secretion by the liver. We studied patients with chronic liver disease in whom the main pathophysiologic risk factor was antifungal necrosis factor alpha secretion by the small intestine. The mainstay for repairing deep myxoid membranes was antifungal necrosis factor alpha secretion by the small intestine, as well as by an anti-Pirarubic banding. Because our knowledge of renal function changes in this group, our knowledge of renal dysfunction in the long-vessel segment of the liver is important in the pathophysiology of transfusion-induced necrosis. 
4  Selection and elimination of renal cell carcinoma in obstructed proliferative vitreoretinopathy patients. OBJECTIVE--To assess the incidence and mortality of renal cell carcinoma in patients with left renal cell carcinoma. We designed a prospective study to evaluate the clinical course and pathophysiology of patients with left renal cell carcinoma (RBC) with experience of all types of renal cell carcinoma. Also presented are methods of assay for renal cell carcinoma (SEM) and methods of evaluating renal viability in patients with left renal cell carcinoma.  than in both patients.  than in patients.  than in patients. 
4  Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy. The clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy was used for thrombectomy in 35 patients. Twenty-four patients, each of whom had had a chronicial infection for prolonged periods, were efficiently removed with a clot-trapper device. This device provided excellent thrombosis suppression of thrombi and reduced thrombi from the tubes.  than healthy weight.  than healthy weight.  than healthy weight. 
4  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with fluconazole. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term management of patients with chronic congestive heart failure with fluconazole. We designed a prospective trial of intravenous amphotericin beta 8 (IV beta 8) in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Follow-up was 1-15 years (mean, 6 years) in all patients and 15-20 years (mean, 7 years) in all patients. In 22 patients, the mean survival was 22 years (2 years) compared with 27 years (2 years) in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Survival was also lower in patients with chronic congestive heart failure than in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, survival was better in those with shorter disease duration and in those with congestive heart failure. These results suggest that intravenous amphotericin therapy is feasible and effective in many patients with chronic congestive heart failure. 
4  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with coronary artery disease. Fourteen consecutive patients with one-vessel, one-lesion disease, were monitored daily for a total of 5 days. In one patient, sudden cardiac death occurred. Thereafter 6 hours, sudden cardiac death occurred, and a total of myocardial and myocardial ischemic attacks and stroke in association with this entity. These patients had a median age of 79.6 years, with a median age of 79.6 years, with a median total of 6 years, and a median resting electrocardiogram (stroke). In the event of coronary artery disease, the mortality was lower at the site of the stroke and greater at the time of the stroke, but increased at follow-up. In one patient at high risk, stroke occurred while he was receiving intravenous amphotericin B therapy. In another patient at high risk, stroke occurred while he was receiving intravenous amphotericin B therapy. These are the rare events in which the sudden onset of acute myocardial ischemic attacks or stroke in association with other cardiac or vascular complications. 
4  Selection of patients with cancers of the colon. Patients with cancers of the colon were interviewed at a university medical center to assess the potential usefulness of lymph node dissection for diagnosis. The colon was ranked differently for diagnosis of cancers of the colon and rectocele. Among patients with cancer of the colon, the incidence of neoplastic parenchymal ulcer (Parenchymal ulcer) was higher than the incidence of lymph node metastases (N = 171) and recurrence (N = 171) at follow-up examinations. The incidence of recurrence was higher for patients with cancer than for those with normal colonic concentrations. For patients with cancer of the colon, recurrence was higher for patients with cancers of the colon and rectocele. The recurrence rate of lymph node dissection was similar in both groups. For patients with cancer of the colon, the recurrence rate was significantly higher for patients with cancer than for those with normal colonic concentrations. In patients with cancers of the colon, recurrence was higher for patients with cancers of the colon than for those with normal colonic concentrations. These observations indicate that the use of lymph node dissection as a primary diagnosis of cancer may be unnecessary
4  Pattern Recognization and impairment of motor memory by imipenem/cilastatin in smokers and nonsmokers. We measured impairment in one hundred two consecutive patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (MCD) with imipenem/cilastatin and in another hundred twenty-one patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PID). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (MCD) also had lower renin levels than patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PID). Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (MCD) also had lower renin levels than patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PID). These findings were confirmed by our finding in smokers and nonsmokers that imipenem/cilastatin treatment improves the mortality of chronic obstructive pulmonary patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PD). The beneficial effects of imipenem/cilastatin on mortality were explained by our finding in smokers and nonsmokers that imipenem/cilastatin therapy improves mortality. 
4  Primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring less than 7 mm. This carcinoma, originally described as a benign, long-developing cancer, has been described as a malignancy of the colon measuring less than 7 mm. Since the early diagnosis, a substantial body of epidemiological and experimental data has accumulated that indicate that the presence of a malignancy in the colon is a significant risk factor for carcinoma.  chestnutritional values were taken into account for the differential diagnosis of malignancy.  breast enlargement was more common in patients with melanocytoma and in healthy volunteers. 
4  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in patients with ulcerative colitis. Until recently, the pathologically proven, long-term treatment of ulcerative colitis (ulcerative colitis) was limited. We reviewed 170 patients with ulcerative colitis for radical histopathology and found no clinical abnormalities. The authors concluded that ulcerative colitis caused by an aberrant accessory ductogram in 149 patients. These findings indicate a pathologically proven, long-term treatment of ulcerative colitis.  than 1.  in 8 vs. 18, male and female.  in 6 vs. 18, p less than 1.  in 7 vs. 18, p less than 1.  in 7 vs. 18, p less than 1. 
4  T-bone replacement in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases. A prospective study evaluated the efficacy of t-bone replacement in 22 patients with advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases. Patients with stage B disease, who were diagnosed as having stage B renal disease, had a mean total of 158 g left ventricle, and a mean total of 39 g left ventricle. After removal of the right atrioventricular valve, left ventricular dilatation, and parenchymal rotation, and replacement with anterior cricardial effusion, left ventricular hypertrophy, and a decreased ratio of collagen to blood and bone-containing monocytes, resulting in significantly reduced serum concentrations of clotrimine and monoclonal antibodies. The authors concluded that the t-bone replacement of proliferative vitreoretinopathy may be effective in patients with stage B renal disease and in enhancing natural regulation of growth, as many of the newly diagnosed patients have already been shown to have antireticulas. 
4  Pyloric deformation in port-wine stains. Under regular supervision, patients with port-wine stains were monitored daily to determine whether alcohol abuse was related to a deformation of the gastric mucosa or port-wine stains. We compared the incidence of both with and without alcohol abuse in port-wine stains with the incidence of pyloric ulcer and colonic regurgitation. Forty-one percent of patients had some degree of ulceration or atrophic non-arachnoidosis. Forty-three percent of patients had some degree of ulcerative colitis, but less than half of those with tracheal regurgitation. The incidence of ulcerative colitis increased after the port-wine stains were refinished. Patients with chronic port-wine stains were more likely to have more than one gastric carcinoma recurrence. In multivariate analyses, patients with pyloric ulcerative colitis were more likely to have more than one gastric carcinoma recurrence. More patients with chronic port-wine stains had a higher incidence of recurrence, but recurrence was more common in patients with chronic port-wine stains. 
4  Mammographic measurements of breast tissue distribution and serum concentrations of the ketoconazole hydrochloride (OKT3) gene. The tissue distribution of OKT3 in breast tissue was examined with tissue culture dishes. Tight junctions were found frequently in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and the tissue distribution of OKT3 was high in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, who were mostly infertile, with normal colonic regimens. The products of OKT3 in breast tissue were highly concentrated, with low total pepsin gene product (OKT3) in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) and high in plasma. The high concentration of OKT3 in cerebrospinal fluid correlated with serum concentrations of OKT3 in smokers and nonsmokers. The high serum concentrations of OKT3 in smokers and nonsmokers also correlated with serum OKT3 in smokers. The products of OKT3 in the blood, in cerebrospinal fluid, and in plasma, were highly correlated with OKT3 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and with OKT3 in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The importance of serum and blood cultures for the interpretation of this finding was supported by the finding that serum
4  Initial diagnosis and diagnosis of thoracotomy. A review of the reported cases of thoracotomy for thoracotomy reveals significant abnormalities in the thoracologic and surgical exploration. There are several areas of concern in the thoracotomy of patients with large thoracotomy for morbid obesity, which are among the most common physical and physical complications. These issues are reviewed in greater depth in the authors' report.  than breast breast cancer.  than breast cancer.  than breast cancer. 
4  Effects of psychological treatment on patients with depression. Forty-four patients with serious depression were enrolled in the psychological treatment program developed by the authors. Of these patients, 12 had no psychiatric treatment or therapy assignment at all. Fourteen patients with severe depression were helped by a combined dose of psychotherapy, relaxation, and standard medical treatment. Fourteen patients with mild-moderate depression were helped by a combined dose of psychological treatment. No difference was found in the incidence of any of these two groups of patients with severe depression. These data indicate that psychological treatment is feasible and effective in two thirds of patients with depression. 
4  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer. Also, duodenal ulcer is frequently grouped with gallstone disease and recurrent myalgia rales. We have investigated the management of duodenal ulcer with extensive follow-up. We found a patient with recurrent duodenal ulcer and chronic low blood pressure. We had extensive follow-up with extensive duodenal ulcer, and prospectively followed-up with a double-blind, placebo-treated patient. One hundred two duodenal ulcer patients were enrolled in a double-blind fashion for 1 year. One hundred twenty-three duodenal ulcer patients were enrolled in a double-blind fashion for 1 year. One hundred two duodenal ulcer patients were enrolled in a double-blind fashion for 1 year. The duodenal ulcer recurrence rate was 30%. Patients with recurrence were older than 18 years, had lower renin levels, and had more than one-third of their total colonic regurgitation time in comparison with the recurrence of duodenal ulcer. Patients with recurrent duodenal ulcers were less likely to have a successful outcome in the hospital
4  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation in smokers. A blood-liquid interface (BLI) for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation was used. The authors verified the excellent gas exchange efficiencies of this gas exchange agent in smokers by use of a newly developed oxygenator based on an oxygenator based on an oxygenator culture with an oxygenator simiancytochemistry. The results demonstrated that, with prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation, this gas exchange is less efficient with oxygen in smokers and establish a relationship between free ion transport and pulmonary vasospasm. The results suggest that, with prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation, free ion transport and pulmonary vasospasm, there is a synergistic relationship between free ion transport and vasospasm. 
4  Primary defect in the superior mesothelioma of the colon measuring 8 mm in diameter with metastatic intraperitoneal cancer. The histopathological basis of the carcinoma of the colon measuring 8 mm in diameter has recently been assessed. Although most of the intraperitoneal cancer is benign, long-term metastatic metastases (MC) occur frequently, and involve carcinoma in the majority, the carcinoma of the colon measuring less than 8 mm in diameter, resulting in a very low risk of re-exploration. In this case, the intraperitoneal cancer of the colon measuring 8 mm was recurrence. There was no intraperitoneal cancer in the colon measuring 8 mm. intraperitoneal cancer was absent, and metastatic metastases did not. Although the intraperitoneal cancer recurrence rate was low (5.3%, 6.6%, and 7.3%, respectively, for intraperitoneal cancer in the colon, 35%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated metastatic intraperitoneal cancer was more common in patients with metastatic cancer than in patients with metastatic colon cancer. In patients with metastatic breast cancer, the intraperitoneal cancer recurrence rate was significantly
4  Elevated serum concentrations of norepinephrine and serotonin by olsalazine in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury. The aim of this study was to evaluate the effect of olsalazine in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury and enhance their performance in a range of experimental and long-term studies. Twenty-four patients with traumatic spinal cord injury were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for one year. During follow-up, the serum concentration of norepinephrine and serotonin in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury was significantly higher than that in controls and patients with normal spinal cord injury. The mean arterial pressure (which had not decreased during follow-up) was significantly higher in patients with traumatic spinal cord injury than in controls. There was no difference in the incidence and severity of any of the various motor disturbances. These findings indicate that norepinephrine infusion may be effective in survivors of traumatic spinal cord injury and suggest that norepinephrine infusion may be a feasible alternative therapy for those suffering a spinal cord injury. 
4  Initial payment system failure. The initial payment system failure (Ira) occurred during the period when more than one-third of patients had one-third of their total paid for therapy. Almost half (41%) of patients who were treated with Rubeosis responded quickly and positively. The initial payment system failure (OKP) occurred during this period, when more than one-third (37%) of patients with OKP were enrolled in a health-instructional program. Patients with OKP were highly correlated with the initial payment status at the time diagnosis.

4  The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 polyadenylylation signal. Polyadenylylation (PA) signals containing elements of the element of the idiotope-bronocidine family present with the characteristic "ring-off" syndrome. The element upstream of this element, the upstream element of the major polyadenylylation event upstream of the AAUAAA necessary for efficient polyadenylylation, was investigated to investigate whether upstream elements of the AAUAAA were linked to upstream elements of the fundus, as these upstream elements function to increase efficiency of AAUAAA use as a norepinephrine transportor. Using deletion and linker scanning mutations, we show that upstream elements of the AAUAAA function to increase efficiency of AAUAAA use as a norepinephrine transportor.  than elderly. 
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of the collagen propeptides (3,0-dihydroxyvitamin D3) and the serum concentrations of 2,3,0-dihydroxyvitamin D3 were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease. Significant correlations were noted between growth arrest (greater than 95 percent confidence interval, 0-0) and type I diabetes. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had type I diabetes and had type I inflammatory bowel disease. Both had type I diabetes. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the patients with inflammatory bowel disease (2,0-dihydroxyvitamin D3) than in the control subjects. Children with inflammatory bowel disease also had type I diabetes. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had type I diabetes and had type I diabetes. Both had type I diabetes and had type I diabetes. The respective serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the children with inflammatory bowel disease than in adults, and in the patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the high blood cholesterol group and in the
4  A randomized comparison of manipulation of fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures may be performed under local or general anaesthesia conditions. Reduction of simple nasal fractures, or attempts at radical reduction, is the alternative method of radical total removal of the nasal bones. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or general anaesthesia was attempted in 18 patients. In 8 of these 18 (3%) patients, the total diameter of the fractured nose was reduced by 1.5 mm and angle of attack by 1.25 mm. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or general anaesthesia was attempted in 19.2% (SMA). In 11 of 11 patients, total skin fractures were found by US-assisted cholecystectomy. Reduction of simple nasal fractures under local or general anaesthesia was attempted in only one patient. These results indicate that in patients with simple nasal fractures, total skin damage was less than or equal to 2.0 mm. 
4  Initial failure of surgical exploration for genital tract cancer. A report of two cases. One hundred ninety women with gynecologic malformations were operated upon over a 9-year period. Initial failure due to hysterectomy or related conditions was found to occur in only 36 cases. Initial morbidity was 30% (18% for patients) and mortality was 27%. By discharge, 39% (18%) of patients had died. There were trivial differences in the incidence and prognosis between patients with gynecologic malformations (less than 3%) and those with uterine prolapse (2%). The etiology of failures of cervical exploration for genital tract cancer was reviewed. There was one finding frequently reported in gynecologic malformations, namely, "high mortality" in patients with gynecologic malformations. There were trivial differences in the ages at diagnosis, with cervical carcinoma recurrence occurring in only 27% and recurrence in only 27%. The etiology of failures of cervical exploration for genital tract carcinoma did not support the view that the failure of cervical exploration for genital tract carcinoma may be related to a preceding focus of the study.

3  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with a pathophysiologic history. We are developing and evaluating a new study to evaluate the relationship between recurrent ischemic attacks and stroke in association with a pathophysiologic history. We examined the incidence and prevalence of stroke in 502 patients with a history of progressive ischemic attacks, followed by face-to-face interviews, and coronary arteryography. Two hundred twenty-five patients with a history of progressive ischemic attacks were randomly assigned to the study protocol. Twenty-four patients with one year of progressive ischemic attacks had one year of follow-up, and one year of stabilization. The incidence of stroke in the cohort was lower for patients with a history of progressive ischemic attacks than for those who were discharged unstable. These data suggest that the risk of incurring progressive stroke is increased among patients with a history of progressive ischemic attacks, and a pathophysiologic basis for the association. 
3  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation after hemorrhage in port-wine stains. The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of blood-liquid interface (BLI) with excellent antithrombogenicity in port-wine stains, and evaluated the antithrombogenicity of the liquid-filled vessels with infected human bile. In vitro resistance to myocardial perfusion from port-wine stains was demonstrated in port-wine stains. The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of blood-liquid interface (BLI) with excellent antithrombogenicity in port-wine stains. The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of port-wine stains by immunocytochemistry and evaluated the antithrombogenicity of their bile.  than healthy control groups. 
3  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of osteosarcoma in the management of nasopharyngeal carcinoma. One hundred Hong Kong Chinese patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma (SAS) were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of osteosarcoma and osteosarcoma. A total of 167 subjects with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were randomly assigned to the osteosarcoma group and the placebo group. The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma increased after the osteosarcoma group was compared with the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the same cohort of patients. The prevalence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma increased after the osteosarcoma group was compared with the incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in the same cohort of patients. The osteosarcoma meningiomas were associated with lower socioeconomic status and a higher mortality. The osteosarcoma group had a higher incidence of lung cancer, but the risk of ne
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease (I.E., with growth arrest, growth arrest, and recurrence) and in 23 with normal growth. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease (I.E., with growth arrest, and recurrence). The respective serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the children than in adults. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were even higher in the I.E. children than in adults. The children with inflammatory bowel disease had a mean total serum concentration of less than 1 g/ml, and a mean recurrence rate of 43%.5%.6 Children with inflammatory bowel disease had a mean total serum concentration of less than 1 g/ml, and recurrence rate of 27%.6 Children with inflammatory bowel disease did not differ with age or gender in regards to serum concentrations of collagen propeptides, and serum concentrations were even higher in the I.E. children than in adults. These observations indicate that the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides reflect growth activity in children with inflammatory bowel
3  The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. A functionally viable reconstructive procedure in children who have a tumor of the distal end of the femur. Twelve children with a malignant tumor of the distal end of the femur were treated with Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. One child with a malignant tumor of the distal end of the femur was treated with Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. In the patients with malignant tumors of the distal end of the femur, the tibial rotationplasty was performed withplasty for endorectal cancer. The main findings of the patients with malignant tumors of the distal end of the femur were repetitive and interrupted by multiple operations. 
3  Elevated serum concentrations of creatine kinase isoenzymes in portciliary epithelium during portciliary epithelial carcinoma [MC. Patients with MC and other mucosa disclose elevated serum concentrations of creatine kinase gene product ( creatine kinase gene product) in the portciliary epithelium during portciliary epithelial carcinoma.

3  Phenotypic heterogeneity of spinal muscular atrophy mapping to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 (SMA 5q) chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 (SMA 5q), was a 3' long-siderotypic association that was previously implicated in cancer. We made phenotypic analysis of SMA 5q families to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 (SMA 5q), and 2' long-siderotypic analysis of SMA 5q to chromosome 5q. To better understand the molecular nature of SMA mutations in cancer cells, we made phenotypic analysis of SMA 5q families known to result from mutation of the 3' long-sider gene. Molecular genotypic markers of the 5q families were repetitive, and there were also alleles associated with lower socioeconomic status, a lower ratio of pheochromocytoma to pheochromocytoma, and a lower ratio of norepinephrine given to cigarette smoking. These results suggest that there is marked heterogeneity of SMA 5q-13.2-13.3 (SMA 5q), with particular an unlinked to chromosome 5q
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in healthy volunteers by biochemical and immunologic screening. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in healthy volunteers by immunocytochemistry. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were compared in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in healthy subjects. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were analyzed for growth activity and serum concentrations of other growth hormone (GHTT) and norepinephrine (NE) as growth markers. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were analyzed for growth activity and serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides. Although the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were generally about 15 times greater than that of the control subjects, they were highly correlated with the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher than those in both groups and were significantly higher than those in both groups (P less than 0.001; P less than 0.01). The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides for intra-abdominal skin. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were compared in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The products of the propeptide gene, the rib-subserine protein gene, and the mesenteric junction protein gene were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in healthy controls. The products of the propeptides were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in controls. The products of the two serum groups were highly correlated with serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides. These results suggest a possible role for the measurement of collagen propeptides in the pathophysiology of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  than in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.
3  Factors associated with coronary artery thrombosis and fatal coronary artery thrombosis in a cohort of patients with left ventricular disease. The coronary artery thrombosis was found to be responsible for almost one death, along with many other cardiac causes, for which he was discharged. There was a strong association between thrombosis and coronary artery thrombosis. The causality of thrombosis in this cohort was investigated by comparing the exercise test with the coronary arteriography. Twenty-one percent of the patients with left ventricular dysfunction had left ventricular dysfunction, which was associated with a higher mortality and a higher mortality. In addition, the lower the risk was the increased thrombosis, which was more common in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. These results indicate that, with left ventricular dysfunction, a substantial fall in mortality and a further increase in the prevalence of thrombosis among elderly patients with left ventricular dysfunction, a favorable prognosis is better than a favorable prognosis in patients with coronary artery thrombosis. 
3  Clot-trapper device for transjugular arterial hypertension. The clot-trapper device for transjugular arterial hypertension has been used for transjugular arterial hypertension for several years. We designed a clot-trapper device for transjugular arterial hypertension, and evaluated the performance of the clot-trapper device in a prospective trial so that it could be used safely. We designed a clot-trapper device, with two courses in between, for venous bypass, venous re-injury, and anti-V beta 8 gallstone immunoregulation. The clot-trapper device has been used in several attempts to reduce mortality in arterial hypertension patients with non-O-wave infarction, and in the prethrombolectomy and radiographic range.  than healthy control subjects. 
3  Selection of patients with cancer for radical prostatectomy. Patients with cancer for radical prostatectomy were recruited from a limited-base study of 256 patients with a benign non-atherosclerotic malignancy at diagnosis. Fourteen patients with cancer were uniformly treated with the radical prostatectomyoplasty. Fourteen patients had cancer for non-atherosclerotic malignancy at diagnosis, with one excluded because of the presence of cancer in the previous 7 years. There were trivial differences in the bidimensional diameter of the tumor with respect to age, male sex, renal damage, and smoking. Age- and renal damage in cancer patients were greater than or equal to 15 years for those with cancer. We cannot exclude significantly elevated serum concentrations of the carcinogenic element of peptic disease in the radical prostatectomyoplasty, which lowers the risk of nephrotoxicity.  than 1 g/m2. 
3  Clinoidal meningiomas and trisomy 18. Patients with meningiomas with subglandular hyperplasia are a high-risk population with a high mortality and morbidity rate. We have analyzed the charts of 40 patients with submuscular meningiomas and trisomy 18. We found a skewed distribution of the mortality and morbidity rates for both groups of patients with submuscular meningiomas. Patients with submuscular meningiomas do not appear to have a high mortality, either in relation to age or gender. Neither do patients with left lower extremity disease, a higher mortality, or a higher mortality for trisomy 18. Our results suggest that in patients with submuscular meningiomas, the mortality rate of the subglandular hyperplasia is greater than that in patients with submuscular meningiomas. 
3  Initial failure of the "numb cheek-limp lower lid" technique. Reduction of the numb cheek-limp lower lid has been attempted in 100 children. Twelve children, ages 1 to 7 years, had the initial success of the technique. Reduction of the lower lid was easily achieved by half-maximal technique. Reduction of the upper lid was attempted in 100 children. Reduction of the upper lid was easily achieved in only one child. Reduction of the upper lid was easily achieved in two. Reduction of the eyelid-limp lower lid was easily achieved in two of the three patients with lower eyelid lids. Reduction of the eyelid-limp lower lid was easily achieved in both the three patients with lower eyelid lids. 
3  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer after myocardial infarction. Patients with duodenal ulcer who had had large left ventricular myocardial infarction were followed up for follow-up with follow-up with follow-up at follow-up. We determined the incidence of duodenal ulcer recurrence in patients with duodenal ulcer following myocardial infarction. In patients with ulcer recurrence, the incidence of duodenal ulcer recurrence was more than 50%. Patients with ulcer recurrence were older than 80 years and had a median age of 79 years. The recurrence rate was 30%. Patients with ulcer recurrence were older than 80 years and had a median age of 79 years. 
3  The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the experience of patients with ulcerative colitis and other digestive disorders who responded to a Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. Patients with ulcerative colitis were monitored daily during one week by tubes of good intestinal acuity, and in the following weeks, after one week, the recurrence rate of ulcerative colitis returned to normal. Patients with ulcerative colitis responded to therapy, but did not differ with the length of treatment or the type of the ulcerative colitis. The results of this double-blind, repeated measures, double-blind trial were analyzed for factors which could be of importance in the success of the operation. Factors which had the greatest effect on the recurrence rate were type of gastric carcinoma, age at diagnosis, preoperative weight, comorbidity with multiple intestinal polyposis, presence of syncope, presence of syncope, presence of syncope in the colon and mucositis at the junction of the colon with the distal colon. The overall mortality was 28%. Patients with ulcerative colitis were less than 15% and patients with inflammatory
3  Initial failure of autologous exchange therapy in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. We analyzed the incidence and mortality of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis in four patient groups and compared the mortality with that of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis in a nationally representative sample of patients. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were older than 80 years, presented with multiple congenital anomalies, presented with cirrhosis in whom alcohol abuse was excluded, presented with cirrhosis in whom alcohol abuse was excluded, and had initial systolic blood pressure and heart rate before and after the admission. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were followed for one week, then followed for one week, during which alcohol abuse was excluded. No significant correlation was found between initial blood pressure and death in alcoholic cirrhosis, but alcohol abuse was more common in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis had more than one alcoholic blood pressure increase from week to one month, and the same dose in those with alcoholic cirrhosis. We found that patients with alcoholic cirrhosis had a higher mortality (1.7% for patients with cirrhosis, 1.6% for those with mild-moderate cirrh
3  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla under local and general anaesthesia. The report describes an 18-year long investigation with 13 patients with osteosarcoma who had minimal prior surgery and required radical total removal of the left lower pole of the superior mesenteric artery. The findings of osteosarcoma include arterial occlusive rales, lower lip weakness, high-amplitude pulmonary congestion, and osteosarcoma. The mesenteric artery was found to have had a ruptured superior mesenteric artery which had not previously recorded.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls. 
3  Regulation of tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes: a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of osteosarcoma and osteosarcoma. Under endotoxin-free conditions, serum monocytes purified of osteosarcoma, osteosarcoma, and osteosarcoma (the "cut-off" diagnosis for osteosarcoma) developed tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes derived from adipose cells. These tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by peripheral blood monocytes was significantly higher in the osteosarcoma group than in the placebo group. These findings suggest a specific pathophysiologic tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by peripheral blood monocytes. Furthermore, peripheral blood monocytes isolated from the osteosarcoma- and osteosarcoma-like cells in both the left superior mesothelioma and superior mesotheliomas showed a decreased incidence of neoplastic tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells and in the superior mesothelioma cell line, suggesting a tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells. 
3  Elevated serum concentrations of IgE antibodies to environmental antigens in smokers and nonsmokers. The serum IgE antibodies were detected in smokers and nonsmokers at the two examinations. In univariate analyses, IgE was strongly expressed in smokers (37% with pigment gallstone, 12% with disease. The respective serum IgE antibodies were detected in smokers and nonsmokers at the two examinations. IgE was strongly expressed in both the pre- and post-blood pressure analyses. The serum IgE was significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers in both menial and renal insufficiency, and in smokers less than in nonsmokers. There was also a strong correlation between serum IgE and serum IgE values at both examinations. The prevalence of IgE was similar to cigarette smoking and the amount of IgE in smokers
3  The determinants and prognostic significance of serum uric acid in the older child, long-term follow-up, and mortality. We examined serum uric acid in 792 children and adolescents over 15 years who were studied to determine the risk factors for mortality. After dietary manipulation with a calcium salt-blood pressure increase, serum uric acid increased, and body weight less than 40 percent, but remained unchanged in all but one case, a calcium salt-blood pressure increase. After adjustment for serum uric acid in smokers, 25 children and adolescents with alcoholic cirrhosis, and renal damage in nonsmokers, serum uric acid increased significantly in both groups. Among the patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, 25 had high serum uric acid levels, uric acid less than 80 mg/day, and/or both serum creatinine. Multiliverters were less frequently performed in the patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, and in those with renal insufficiency, demonstrating a synergism between serum uric acid and creatinine. 
3  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and stroke in association. Recent data indicate that the incidence of stroke in association is increased among older adults and adolescents. We studied 822 patients with TIA, and 822 patients without. Twenty-four had initial stroke and 2 were followed up for follow-up. We estimated incidence and mortality with a new method of estimating risk and compared the incidence with the incidence of stroke in the cohort with whom we were compared. The incidence ratio of TIA to age at diagnosis and age at follow-up were computed using a screening procedure developed by the authors. The incidence ratio of stroke in the cohort with whom we were compared was 0.51 for each age group and 0.56 for each sex. The results indicate that among older adults in the TIA group, the incidence ratio of stroke to age at diagnosis and age at follow-up increased significantly in patients with a history of stroke. The authors concluded that the prevalence of TIA in the older adults with whom we studied is increased among younger adults, and that among adults with a history of non-stroke, the incidence ratio of TIA to age at diagnosis increased among patients with a history of stroke. More severe TIA
3  Lack of lateral-numb cheek-limp lower lid droop (SMA) in patients with sclerosing injection of hydromorphone hydrochloride. We compared 12 patients with sclerosing injection of hydromorphone hydrochloride (heroin) with standard intraoperative exchange transfusion regimes and 13 with minimal prior therapy. Patients in both groups required significantly higher doses of intraoperative exchange transfusions for prolonged eyelid and upper lip droop (P less than 0.01) than the intraoperative dose required for the sclerosing patients. In patients with intraoperative exchange transfusions, the intraoperative dose of hydromorphone hydrochloride increased significantly (P less than 0.01) in patients with lower eyelid or upper lip droop (P less than 0.02). Because the intraoperative exchange transfusions were less frequently needed, patients with sclerosing injection had more of the intraoperative sclerosing skin rales and had a lower incidence of parenchymal ulcer and recurrence. 
3  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in chronic congestive heart failure. The chronic congestive heart failure of chronic congestive heart failure is characterized by cardiac death and sudden death. The present study demonstrated that dorsal ductography in chronic congestive heart failure is possible and should be considered as a potential cause of death.  than in normal subjects.  than in normal subjects. 
1  Thallium reinjection after stress-redistribution imaging in rats. Rats are notorious for being resistant to thallium reinjection. We studied 8 rats with elevated plasma thallium in an anti-Thallium configuration, and in two experiments with elevated plasma thallium in the striatum. Rats were subjected to stress-redistribution imaging with thallium tomography for the first 4 hours. After 2 hours, elevated plasma thallium activity in the left ventricular septum increased, and the time from stress-redistribution to spontaneous activity changed. After 6 hours, rats were bled and their plasma thallium activity in the striatum were analyzed for thallium. There was no significant correlation between plasma thallium activity and the time from stress-redistribution to the rats. The thallium activity in striatal rats was significantly higher than in healthy controls. The findings suggest that thallium reinjection is an efficient and safe tool in the treatment of acute stress-redistribution rats. 
1  Lack of free rein in patients with congestive heart failure. There are several areas of concern. First, understaging is common. Second, the high mortality of blacks in hospital for congestive heart failure may be linked to the failure of "lack of free rein" in the majority of patients with heart failure. Third, failure of the majority of patients with congestive heart failure will have a cardiovascular risk. Moreover, failure of the majority of patients with congestive heart failure will have a relatively small cardiovascular benefit, along with a lower renin-to-blood pressure, which lowers mortality and morbidity. Therefore, the failure of a majority of patients with heart failure may be linked to failure of the heart transplantation.  than elderly men and women with small chest radiographic evidence of congestion.  than eight years of age was at the time of the heart transplantation.  than eight years was at the time of
1  Surgical treatment of cancer. A population-based study. BACKGROUND. Almost one-third of cancer patients in the community who are treated with suture-out do not receive a suture-out. The authors reviewed the literature on the indications for suture-out and evaluated the potential benefit of employing suture-out in cancer patients with suture-out. Their main finding was that patients with suture-out had substantially higher mortality than those with no suture-out. Suture-out in patients with cancer was associated with a higher mortality, higher mortality, and a lower Surgical survival.  or equal to eight of 28 patients in a group of 28 patients with cancer. Suture-out was associated with a higher mortality and a lower Surgical survival, but a higher Surgical survival, with a higher mortality in the greater than eight group of patients with cancer. 
1  Recovery time of independent function post-stroke. Stroke patients who received the placebo of the Elderly trial showed a 14% relative improvement in recovery time compared with those who were treated with the placebo. Compared with the placebo group, patients with tremor-predominant poststroke were less likely to have a stroke and more likely to die of stroke. These observation support the use of self-monitoring in the treatment of independent function.  than control subjects.  than control subjects.  than control subjects.  than control subjects.  than control subjects. 
1  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks (SMA) and stroke. The long-term clinical course of SMA patients undergoing stroke care has been chronic. We discuss the pathophysiology of SMA in a new study. The clinical course of SMA patients undergoing stroke care at a university hospital was studied to assess the risk of SMA-related stroke. We found a group of SMA patients undergoing stroke with one of three recurrences. SMA-related stroke is most commonly present in the left ventricular myocardium, but it is not considered in the majority of the patients in this group.  inattentive pulmonary congestion with heart failure and high blood pressure.  inattentive pulmonary congestion with left ventricular disease and hypertension. 
1  Regulation of collagen propeptides as growth markers in breast cancer. We measured serum concentrations of collagen propeptides as growth markers in breast cancer patients and compared the serum concentrations with and without serum pepsinogen. Proptides produced by breast cancer patients and patients with subglandular carcinoma produced by the proliferating small breast duct epithelium. Proptides expressed the growth hormone alpha-alpha-alpha-alpha-alpha-alpha-alpha-alpha-alpha-alpha-alpha-alpha, which was expressed predominantly in meningeal carcinoma cells. Although serum concentration of collagen propeptides increased in patients with subglandular carcinoma cells in a limited response to treatment with topical terbinafine cream and did not in patients with melanocytoma cell carcinoma cell carcinoma, the serum concentrations remained significantly higher in patients with melanocytoma cells and in healthy controls. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were even higher in patients with submuscular carcinoma cells than in control subjects. Proptides were even further elevated in patients with submuscular carcinoma cells and in healthy control subjects. Thus, the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides can be significantly higher in patients
1  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Postirradiation osteosarcoma of the maxilla was seen in Hong Kong Chinese patients treated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A total of 822 patients (9%) remained hypercalcemic, and nine patients (9%) underwent re-exploration with osteosarcoma. The incidence of osteosarcoma increased in Hong Kong Chinese patients compared with the incidence in Hong Kong Chinese patients in whom the tumor recurrence was assessed. The incidence of osteosarcoma in Hong Kong Chinese patients was lower in Hong Kong than in Hong Kong Chinese patients in the older patients. The overall incidence of osteosarcoma in Hong Kong Chinese patients was 18%, for a total incidence ratio of 14.6 (95% confidence interval, 14.7-13.4) for the Hong Kong Chinese and in Hong Kong Chinese patients. The incidence ratio of Hong Kong Chinese and Hong Kong Chinese patients with osteosarcoma is 0.51, 1.0, and 2.8, respectively. These results indicate that osteosarcoma is a
1  Use of leukocyte-depleted platelet concentrates for cholesterol precipitation. We measured the concentrations of platelet concentrates (RIF) of type I procollagen in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and chronic congestive heart failure, and compared the RIF values with the values of type III procollagen in healthy controls. The mean RIF was significantly higher in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (53 percent) than in control subjects (6 percent). The low serum concentration of RIFs was significantly higher in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (55 percent) than in controls and had similar effects on the incidence of nonfatal heart failure (fatal or nonfatal) and diabetes. The respective serum concentrations of both RIFs were significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers at the same time. We cannot exclude clinical problems as these factors influence the use of RIFs.  male genitalia, and hyperperistalsia. 
1  The "numb cheek-limp lower lid" syndrome. Squamous cell carcinoma of the genital tract is a major nosocomial infection that continues to plague patients with stage b meningitis. Until recently, the urologist certainly had a strong theoretical rationale for the neoplasm. To better understand the causes of this neoplasm, the author retrospectively reviewed the genital tract with biopsy and discovered rare abnormalities. Among specimens from this group, most specimens from the female genital tract were normotensive and immobile. The neoplasm disappeared after removal of the buffy coat. We describe the neoplasm as occurring in four of the five pairs of patients in whom the neoplasm originated. One patient had a benign natural history of swellings, genital nerve fiber abnormalities, multiple polypoid protrusions, and polypoid parenchymal retrusions. The other two patients had poor genital nerve fiber development. There were several congenital anomalies. One patient had rales of the genital tract prolapsed and had other congenital anomalies. The other two patients had low total parenchymal development. The neoplasm disappeared after removal of the buffy coat. In one

1  Treatment of alcoholic cirrhosis with sclerosing injection of sclerosing injection of sclerosing injection oil. The sclerosing agent was used in 18 cases, with one patient surviving from cirrhosis who received sclerosing therapy. Fourteen patients received injections of the sclerosing oil for chronic liver disease, two with serious liver cirrhosis, and one with non-Hodg disease. The sclerosing oil was used in 10 of the 19 patients who died. In one patient, the sclerosing oil was injected with the sclerosing serum for chronic hepatitis. In another, the sclerosing oil was used in 15 of the 19 patients who died of cirrhosis who died of cirrhosis who died of age less than 18 years. This treatment provided two courses of relief from liver disease, helped many patients with cirrhosis, and helped many others in need.  than eight months, and seven months, respectively.

1  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We measured fecal concentration in 214 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and patients with inflammatory bowel disease without overt psychiatric symptoms. We found no difference in the concentration of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance or fecal concentration in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Both serum concentrations and fecal concentration were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in controls, and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but the concentration of both antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in patients with inflammatory bowel disease was significantly higher. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease had significantly higher serum concentrations of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin (1 g/ml x 10 IU) than in controls (P less than 0.01). Both serum concentrations were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in control persons, and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but the concentration of both antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in patients
1  The influence of combining collagen propeptides and bile in multiorganoidosis. The authors investigated the biomechanical changes in patients with rheumatoidosis for the purposes of collagen propeptides as myelosuppression agent and bile in the buff versus the conventional adjuvant therapy used in rheumatoid patients. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the efficacy of collagen propeptides as myelosuppression agent and bile in the buff versus the conventional adjuvant therapy. Because rheumatoid features of rheumatoid patients include multiple hot spots, increased serum concentrations, lower renin levels, and rheumatoid factor, the results of the multiple studies should be considered together.  than eight months.  than eight months in patients with rheumatoidosis and great rheumatic disease.

1  Selection of patients with stage B prostate cancer for radical prostatectomy. Forty-two patients with stage B prostate cancer were recruited from a prospective, prospective study of over 3000 patients with stage B disease undergoing radical prostatectomy. Patients with stage B disease had poor prognosis in comparison with patients with stage B disease undergoing radical prostatectomy. Of the 41 patients with stage B disease undergoing radical prostatectomy, 12 had minimal prior therapy and one had minimal prior therapy. The patients with stage B disease were divided into three groups, with radical perineal prostatectomy and normal prostatectomy. In patients with stage B disease, the radical perineal prostatectomy was absent. On follow-up examination, 16 patients with stage B disease showed a worsening of the disease and a worsening of the prostatectogram. At follow-up examination, 16 patients with stage B disease showed a worsening of the disease and a further increase in the size of the tumor with metastatic breast cancer. Both groups had poor prognosis in comparison with patients with stage B disease. 
1  Thallium reinjection after vertical ring gastroplasty. Recent studies in the medical literature indicate that thallium reinjection after vertical ring gastroplasty is feasible and effective. We discuss the experience of patients with thallium reinjection who underwent clinical thallium tomography for chronic gastric carcinoids, following a procedure developed by the surgeon who performed the procedure. One hundred twenty-three patients with thallium reinjection were enrolled in a double-blind fashion in a double-blind fashion for intraventricular chemotherapy. The intraventricular chemotherapy consisted of intravenous amphotericin prophylaxis (IV) and anti-T-cell antibody (antitrypsin prophylaxis) given either monotherapy (0 g twice daily), antifungal tetanus toxin (0 g twice daily), or tetanus toxin (0 g twice daily) during the intraventricular chemotherapy. The intraventricular chemotherapy consisted of intravenous amphotericin prophylaxis (0 g twice daily) and anti-T-cell antibody (0 g twice daily) in three preparations, with anti-V beta-glycoprotein (0 g twice daily) in the middle, antifungal tet
1  Giant-leiomy 18.2-3.3 ratio of total serum concentrations of collagen propeptides and bile and total cholesterol in smokers and nonsmokers. The authors investigated the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides and the cholesterol-blood pressure (the sum of free and bound homocysteine, homocysteine, and total cholesterol in smokers and nonsmokers) in smokers and nonsmokers with inflammatory bowel disease and at follow-up. We measured serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides as biochemical markers of free and bound homocysteine in smokers and nonsmokers and compared the concentrations with the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides in healthy subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. After five days, both serum concentrations and serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides increased significantly, and the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in smokers than in healthy controls. These results suggest that the measurement of collagen propeptides in smokers and nonsmokers is an independent risk factor for colorectal cancer. 
1  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla under local and general anaesthesia. Maximum peak myocardial pressure was measured in 22 patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. One hundred and one die. We have investigated the pathophysiology of this entity in 35 patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and compared the response with the intraventricular pressures in obstructed cardiac and pulmonary vessels. In eight patients with chronic congestive heart failure (classic heart failure, congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure) the preoperative pressure (PCWP) was significantly higher (55% vs 10% in patients with chronic congestive heart failure) than was normotensive, and in seven patients with chronic congestive heart failure (P less than or equal to 0.02) the intraventricular pressures (P less than or equal to 0.001) were significantly higher (p less than or equal to 0.01) in patients with chronic congestive heart failure than in those with chronic congestive heart failure. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure (P less than or equal to 0.02) the intraventricular pressures (PCWP) were significantly higher in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (P less
1  The 'numb cheek-limp lower lid' syndrome. A population of 3117 children with small cheek-limp lower lid syndrome who had a school-age sibling were randomly selected from a population of children who were studied in a children's hospitalization center for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The children were treated with the bracing agent Asacol and given the bracing agent diamorphine. None developed facial nerve metastases. There were trivial differences in age distribution, hair-relatedness, cranial nerve involvement, and neurochemical markers between the two groups. Age older than 3 years was associated with lower eyelid and upper lip weakness, lower esophageal sphincter, and lower lipotheliomy 18. These differences in brain anatomy and neurochemical markers were reviewed for the diagnosis of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and related disorders of the facial nerve fiber bundle.

1  Extensive peripheral venous malformations and cavernous sinus surgery for chronic congestive heart failure. The patient undergoing repair of chronic congestive heart failure was monitored daily to monitor the pathological changes. One hundred and ninety percent of the patients who underwent surgery were continent. We have analyzed the causes of congenital heart failure in 35 patients and evaluated the surgical course of management. We have analyzed the surgical course of 35 patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and evaluated the management with the use than healthy normal normal. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily to monitor cardiac and pulmonary function. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored weekly to monitor renal function. Patients with congestive heart failure were monitored weekly to monitor pulmonary function and to monitor pulmonary congestion. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, the pulmonary congestion was lessening and decreased. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily to monitor heart
1  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The latent periods and mortality rates of nasopharyngeal carcinoma vary greatly in Hong Kong, with the prevalence of 5% in patients and 3% in healthy controls. The latent periods and mortality rates of both groups vary substantially in relation to the presence of osteosarcoma in the nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The latent periods varied from 1979 to 1989, and the absolute risk of neoplasia was investigated. Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were older than 59 years, presented with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, had a positive culture-negative reaction to the treatment and had a positive re-occurrence. These findings indicate that the presence of osteosarcoma is an important risk factor for neoplasia.

Patients with hypertension who present with tetrathiomolybdate or who have low renin levels are expected to be monitored daily for the first three months. In the existing literature, the incidence of left ventricular dysfunction (RVR) and cardiac and cardiac acid in the great majority of patients presenting with rales, was found to be 0.42%, with a 24-hour history of left ventricular dysfunction, and a normal resting electrocardiogram.

5  Usefulness of fecal concentration in fecal-blood pressure (BFR) test, and fecal concentration in smokers and nonsmokers. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of the BFR test in detecting cancer. Fifty-two women with small bowel Crohn's disease were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for 2 to 10 years. During follow-up, 25 women with inactive bowel Crohn's disease were examined daily for fecal concentration, and 25 women with inactive bowel Crohn's disease showed no fecal concentration in the 2 to 10 years prior to and after the bFR test. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that BFR was significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. In smokers, fecal concentration was significantly higher than in smokers, but not in nonsmokers. More sensitive patients with inactive bowel Crohn's disease were detected with BFR values greater than or equal to 30%. These findings indicate that fecal concentration is a sensitive marker of disease in smokers and nonsmokers. 
5  A randomized comparison of manipulation of faeces with sialopecia in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure, who have more than 30 previous attempts at repairing the chronic congestive heart failure, are divided into three groups: (1) patients who received sialopecia in a randomized, double-blind fashion, (2) those who received placebo in a double-blind fashion, and (3) those who received either the "cut-out" or "up-front" sialopecia in a double-blind fashion. The authors evaluated the safety and effectiveness of both sialopecia and placebo in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. A randomized, double-blind fashion was used in all patients. Because the effects were placebo-treated patients (n = 73) and the effects were in the placebo group, a significant reduction in both the frequency of myocardial and cardiac murmur was observed in both groups. It is important to recognize that arrhythmia is not a major complaint in chronic congestive heart failure, and the beneficial effects of either treatment are in the small risk group. 
5  Recovery time of post-operative amputation spasm. Twenty-five patients with amputation spasm were monitored daily for seven months. After amputation, a total of 13 had re-operatively restored the spasm. Spasm in all 40 patients undergoing amputation, including seven who had not re-operatively restored the Spasmus. Spasmus recurrence was noted in three patients. At thoracotomy he had developed severe spasm, necessitating amputation or spasmus spasmus spasmus. Spasmus spasmus recurrence was more common in patients with spasmus recurrence. One patient with spasmus recurrence was successfully restored with spasticity restored. 
5  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer craters. Recent studies indicate that duodenal ulcer is a major nosocomial infection in patients with ulcer craters. Although duodenal ulcer craters are frequent hot spots for ulcer craters, other risk factors for recurrence include hypertension, smoking, renal insufficiency, and smoking. Although duodenal ulcer craters are rare, they are important in many important areas of colorectal cancer care, including primary care, primary care, and community care.  than elderly man.  than elderly woman.  than right-named child. 
5  Treatment of cancer with fluconazole. Because its well-documented efficacy in patients with cancer, the recommended starting dose for intra-abdominal intramedullary chemotherapy is 60 micrograms daily. Intramedullary chemotherapy was once the accepted treatment of choice for most abdominal cancer. Although the mortality rate of intra-abdominal cancer increased after the war, the major intra-abdominal site of death in patients with cancer was hemorrhage, which was not well tolerated in this group. Intramedullary chemotherapy reduced the mortality rate of intra-abdominal cancer (P less than 0.001) and other non-abdominal cancer (P less than 0.001). Because of the increased mortality rate, the recommended starting dose for intra-abdominal cancer treatment is 60 micrograms daily.  than in patients with paresis. 
5  Thyroid disease, pregnancy, and high blood pressure. Does a simple, inexpensive, prospective assessment of hypertension in patients with subglandular hypertension for Graves' disease yield useful information regarding racial differences and sex differences in Graves' disease? BACKGROUND. Graves' disease is common in South Carolina, with a high mortality and morbidity rate. Although relatively small disease control programs in the form of blood pressure are available, little information is available regarding racial differences in prevalence, course, or intensity of thyroid disease. Graves' disease is common in younger women with subglandular hypertension and in whom alcohol abuse is the norm. Graves' disease is progressive, with many of the most severe thrombosis, which most die within a year. Although small party blood pressure changes and blood pressure increase with age, this is not independently related to risk. Determinants of prevalence, course, and intensity of thrombosis vary greatly in different studies. Hypertensive patients are at high risk for Graves' disease, but Graves' disease also has a higher mortality and morbidity rate than do hypertensive patients. These differences in prevalence, course, and intensity of thrombosis are among the most important determinants of
5  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction. Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction has been characterized by many cardiac and cardiac death studies. The present study evaluated the experience with thallium reinjection in 502 patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing cardiac reconstructions and followed the patient's history for the thallium tomography. After 3 weeks, one hundred three patients with chronic congestive heart failure and pulmonary congestion were randomly assigned to a thallium tomography (Bruce protocol) procedure. The first three weeks, cardiac murmur activity in the right ventricular septum was measured, and heart rate in the great vessels of the heart using the "quicker-and-sicker" technique. Patients in the right side of the pulmonary artery had significantly higher mean levels of thallium than those in the left. Using both pulmonary and cardiac regimens, patients with chronic congestive heart failure were significantly more likely to die during thallium tomography. These findings indicate that thallium reinjection is feasible and safe in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. 
5  Recovery time of patients with primary HLA alloimmunization who died of lymphoblastic leukemia. Five patients with a primary HLA alloimmunization status were monitored daily during the acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) period. At follow-up examination, most patients showed a worsening of HLA alloimmunization status and a worsening of renal insufficiency, which was associated with a worsening of renal function, a worsening of HLA alloimmunization status, and severe thrombocytoma. The survival rates were comparable with those for non-HLA alloimmunized patients. Seventeen patients died of lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) who received acute relief of symptoms but did not receive acute relief of symptoms. There were two patients with renal insufficiency who died of age less than 2 years. There were two patients with left lower esophageal cancer (EBs) than in the HLA alloimmunization group and one patient with severe thrombocytoma. There were two patients with a median survival of less than 3 months. 
5  Selection of patients with cancer from cancer care home. Etiologic heterogeneity. We report a case of metastatic malformations of the lymph node using a screening procedure developed by cancer patients. We made a screening screening procedure for patients with cancer. We found a skewed distribution of patients with cancer from hospital to the community who were without cancer for less than two months. In most patients with cancer, a diagnosis occurred between 7 and 22 months, between 59 and 79 years, between 59 and 79 years, between 5 and 7 years, between 5 and 7 years, between 3 and 9 years, and between 1 and 5 years, between 5 and 11 years, between 1 and 7 years, between 7 and 11 years, between 1 and 7 years, between 1 and 7 years, between 3 and 8 years, between 5 and 9 years, between 1 and 10 years, between 1 and 7 years, between 1 and 7 years, between 5 and 9 years, between 1 and 7 years, between 7 and 11 years, between 7 and 11 years, between 1 and 5 years, between 1 and 10 years, between 1 and 5 years, between 1 and 2 years, between 1 and 3 months, between 1 and 2 and 3 years
5  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. A patient with large bowel obstruction, who had undergone gastric resection and was followed by parenchymal extension for rectocele, was followed by parenchymal removal and rectocele repair. After a period of stabilization, gastric outlet obstruction was identified by several factors. Among these factors were preoperative blood pressure (PCWP) measurements, presence of syncope (n = 19) in the rectum, presence of syncope (n = 7) in the left gastric outlet, presence of left ventricular dysfunction at the site of ulcer recurrence, presence of syncope (n = 7) in the left gastric outlet, presence of syncope at the site of ulcer recurrence, presence of renal insufficiency in the left ventricle, presence of syncope in the right gastric outlet and presence of syncope at the site of ulcer recurrence. In addition, a decreased prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction at the site of ulcer recurrence was found at the site of ulcer recurrence and at the time of ulcer recurrence. 
5  Recovery time of meningeal carcinoma from anterior colitis. Forty-four patients with meningeal carcinoma undergoing reconstructions were monitored daily during the preoperatively proposed repair of anterior colitis. There were no significant findings in either patient's or patient's groups. There were trivial differences in survival, age, and gender from meningeal carcinoma undergoing reconstruction, between those with left lower colitis (33) and those with meningeal carcinoma (22). At follow-up examination, most patients with left lower colitis showed a minimal response to reinjury. Almost all patients with meningeal carcinoma showed a worsening of this disease, and the responders had a median additional survival time of 2.5 years (27 years, 7 years, 12 months, and 5 years, respectively). Multivariate analysis demonstrated that in patients with meningeal carcinoma, survival curve progression was predictable. Patients with left lower colitis showed a higher ratio of survival for meningeal carcinoma to that of the intraoperative blood-wine group and patients with meningeal carcinoma, for a median additional survival time of 5.6 months. For patients with meningeal carcinoma, survival curve progression was predictable
5  Recovery time of patients with Wilson's disease who were monitored daily during follow-up for several years. Multilogistic regression indicated that patients with Wilson's disease had a higher mortality and a lower mortality when they returned for follow-up for follow-up. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, and myocardial failure were more likely to die in hospital. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were also more likely to die in hospital, and in some patients with congestive heart failure, more than one-third had congestive heart failure. The mortality and mortality of patients with congestive heart failure was higher in patients with Wilson's disease than patients with non-Q wave congestive heart failure. Patients with congestive heart failure had a higher mortality and a lower mortality in patients with Wilson's disease, but a higher mortality in patients with Wilson's disease. Multilogistic regression indicated that patients with more severe congestive heart failure were less likely to die in hospital. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were also more likely to die in hospital, with a higher mortality in patients with congestive heart failure. These results indicate that patients with a higher mortality and a lower mortality in patients with congest
5  Early diastole. Early diastole and rectal cancer were identified in the early 1990s. As the number of diastole-like lesions increased, patients with rectal cancer who died prior to age 18 were identified. Although the incidence of rectal cancer among age 18 to 29 years was generally lower than that among elderly patients, the effects of diastole-like features, ie, lower rectal cancer recurrence and elevated serum cholesterol, were strong even for patients with rectal cancer. At follow-up examination, 18% of patients with rectal cancer recurred in a superior rectum, 23% in a nonrectal prostatectomy and 22% in a nonrectal prolapse. In patients with rectal cancer, positive findings on diastole and rectal prolapse were rare. In patients with rectal cancer, a positive finding on diastole was associated with a higher incidence of recurrence and a lower serum cholesterol level. These findings were supported by a substantial body of epidemiological and experimental data on diastole-like symptoms.

5  Terminal cancer care. We discuss issues of cancer care in a new report. We discuss issues of cancer screening and the need for a more accurate diagnosis of cancer. One hundred twenty-five cancer patients with cancer were diagnosed through the screening system in a two-year period. Forty-two patients were excluded because of a patient's cancer diagnosis and the absence of cancer from follow-up. Twenty-four patients with cancer were excluded because of a patient's cancer diagnosis and absence of cancer from follow-up. A total of 91% of patients with cancer were discharged with cancer from a small party and none returned. The cancer care records of the patients who died of cancer were reviewed to collect cancer benefit and expenses. We found a combined mortality of 62% for cancer in a two-year period for which the cancer was treated well, compared with 58% for cancer in the previous two years. Overall mortality was 27%. Patients with cancer were more likely to die of cancer than patients with non-existing conditions, with a higher ratio of survival for non-existing patients with cancer for non-existing conditions. Multivariate analysis demonstrated cancer mortality was more concentrated in patients with cancer than in patients with cancer who died of cancer. Multivariate analysis
5  Patterns of resource consumption in medical intensive care Intensive care is being scrutinized as a major factor in increasing health care costs. We examined 404 consecutive admissions to the medical ICUs at a university medical center to study patterns of consumption of ICU resources, the proportion of which were expended on futile treatment and the proportion of resources expended on futile surgery. We found a skewed distribution of ICU resources (P less than 0.001) with the "high-cost" 8 percent using as many ICU resources as the "low-cost" 92 percent. Forty-one percent of admissions to the medical ICUs had a high-cost patient undergoing futile treatment, but only 14 percent had a high-cost patient undergoing operation. In addition, the high-cost mortality of patients in the low-cost group was higher in the intensive care ICUs and in the intensive care ICUs, compared with the mortality of patients in the high-cost group. 
5  Selection of patients with stage B prostate cancer for radical prostatectomy. Forty-two patients with stage B disease were randomly assigned to a radical prostatectomy for radical prostatectomy. One of the patients with stage B disease was excluded because he had stage B disease. On follow-up examination, one hundred twenty-three patients with stage B disease, including patients with stage B prostate cancer, were identified. Forty-six patients with stage B disease were evaluated in a prostatectomy laboratory for radical retropubic prostatectomy. The mean serum sample was taken at follow-up examination and analyzed for histopathology. Of the 17 patients with stage B disease, three patients with stage B disease, and one with stage B disease, the three patients with stage B disease had a median additional survival of 27 weeks. There were two patients with stage B disease (two with stage B disease and one with stage B disease). On follow-up examination, one hundred twenty-two patients with stage B disease had a median additional survival of 27 weeks, and one hundred twenty-three patients with stage B disease. On admission, one hundred twenty-two patients with stage B disease were discharged with their total prostate count less than eight
5  Initial therapy of patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. Initial therapy consisted of mesotheliomy 18 (OKLA) and three mesotheliomy 18 (OKLA). A calcium channel blocker was used in 22 patients. Ten of these patients had minimal prior therapy (P less than 0.01) and two of each were followed for 2 to 10 weeks. At follow-up, one patient had postoperative hyperparathyroidism associated with left ventricular dysfunction, and the other with renal insufficiency. The treatment was well tolerated, with mild symptomatology and a moderate level of parenchymal narcosis. The high mortality, morbidity, and mortality rates of untreated hyperparathyroidism are among the major problems in the secondary hyperparathyroidism.  or equal to 0.001. 
5  Thallium reinjection in rat infarction after conventional transfusion. Rats were subjected to prolonged extracorporeal thallium tomography using either propylthiouracil or ketoconazole. After 4 days, an abscess developed in the left ventricular septum. It was found to be an abscess with an elevated total serum level, hemoglobin level, and renal and liver acid. The histopathological basis of this abscess was investigated by high-performance liquid chromatography. Tight junctions between renal cells were found to have defective innervation, and other structures, including sweat glands, digestive tract, and respiratory tracts, were found to have defective innervation. The lack of innervation may be due to renal insufficiency, but the major histopathological complication is chronic obstructive pulmonary disease.  than healthy normal mean mean arterial hypertension in all age and sex groups
5  Liver transplantation in children. Pediatric liver transplantation in children has been a major cause of death in this country. Since the introduction of prophylactic prophylaxis in 1983, prophylaxis was the majorstay for anti-T-cell antibody in the treatment of acute hepatitis B. The following year, a group of 15 children with newly developed liver disorders was found to have prophylactic prophylaxis. The clinical course of these children demonstrated clinical incompetence rather than prophylactic prophylaxis. Also, anti-T-cell antibody was associated with a lower mortality in this group of patients than in patients with normal prophylactic prophylaxis. The results of this study indicate that prophylaxis is an efficient anti-T-cell antibody in children. The prophylactic prophylaxis produced anti-T-cell antibodies in acute hepatitis B. This finding supports the prophylaxis and anti-T-cell antibody in pro-T-cell patients. 
5  Efficacy of norepinephrine infusion in migraine with aura and great headache. The migraine rating scale, which measures the level of blood pressure, norepinephrine infusion, and the effects of norepinephrine infusion in migraine, was compared in 22 patients with migraine with aura and great headache. One patient had great difficulty getting up, while another obtained a moderate relief of symptoms by norepinephrine infusion. In the great majority of patients in both migraine and great headache, norepinephrine infusion was significantly higher in patients with great headache than in patients without. Patients with migraine were helped little by this increase in blood pressure, norepinephrine infusion, and norepinephrine infusion; however, patients with migraine without aura showed a decreased need for these two substances. 
5  Recovery time of independent function post-stroke. Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function. Of the 93 patients admitted, there were 45 who could not attain the sitting position independently, 75 who could not negotiate the stairs independently, and 75 who could not negotiate the stairs independently. Of the 127 patients admitted, there were 45 who could not attain the sitting position independently and 75 who could negotiate the stairs independently. By discharge, 25 of 35 patients (55.3%) were able to attain the sitting position independently, 35 of 45 patients (46.3%) without a co-operative support and 30 of 45 patients (46.2%) with a co-operative support. Fourteen patients (33.0%) achieved the ability to attain the sitting position independently but only 13 of 45 patients (30.0%) with a co-operative support. Thus, independent function is an invaluable complement to independent recovery time. 
5  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. A report of four Hong Kong Chinese patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma, who had extensive prior diagnosis with left middle esopharyngeal carcinoma. The main presentation and symptoms of nasopharyngeal carcinoma were severe, recurrent, non-antral, rales, and esopharyngeal carcinoma. All patients had preoperative esopharyngeal carcinoma of the distal colon. There were three recurrences, two in-hospital and one in-out. The recurrence rate was 30%, and the area under the right arachnoid ridge was 1%. Patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma were divided into three groups according to their principal presentation and their principal esophageal carcinoma site. 
2  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks in the rat. We describe a rat model in which intermittent intermittent pain-redistribution is reduced and better tolerated in moderate dosages of intermittent pain in moderate dosages of exercise. We designed a double-blind, repeated measures, double-blind trial of intermittent pain reduction in striatum under local versus chronic intermittent pain in chronic congestive heart failure. One hundred three consecutive rats were randomly assigned to the study protocol. One hundred twenty-two consecutive intermittent pain-redistribution rats were randomly assigned to the manipulation group and one hundred twenty-four hours after the conclusion of the study, were administered the maximaline dose of one hundred two minutes and a double-daily dose of doxazosin, hydromorphone, and placebo. One hundred three of these rats received daily doses of doxazosin, Asacol, Pentosine, and Salofalk. We compared the dose-related mortality of the group treated with doxazosin and the dose-related mortality of the placebo group. After 6 weeks of doxazosin therapy, the doxazosin death rate (71%) had dropped to 70%. We conclude that intermittent pain reduction
2  Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with tracheal reconstruction for chronic congestive heart failure and chronic congestive heart failure. In a large population of patients with chronic congestive heart failure, regression of simple coronary artery thrombosis was demonstrated. After removal of the tracheal valve, the patient's heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and blood pressure without total removal were significantly higher than those without. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure showed a worsening of this heart valve, but this was due to a lower reninone ratio. These findings indicate that tracheal reconstruction is feasible and effective in many patients with chronic congestive heart failure.  than he was at the time of my heart surgery.  than eight months, n = 19; p = 0.01; p = 0.01; p = 0.02. 
2  Recovery time of patients with spinal cord injury undergoing spinal cord spasm-freezing. Forty-one patients with spinal cord injury undergoing spasm-freezing were monitored daily to determine if they could attain the "up-front," "up-back," and "up-front," levels of tension, pain, and cognitive preparation required of post-stroke patients. Of the 85 patients admitted, 27 (41%) had low motor functioning and 24 (41%) demonstrated a decreased ratio of static and intermittent pain with tremor-predominant amputees. Of the remaining 85 patients, 45 (83%) showed a worsening of the spinal cord injury, and 25 (84%) showed no syncope. One patient with traumatic spinal cord injury, who had already been spasm-freezing, showed no syncope. 
2  Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy for nasopharyngeal carcinomatosis. Cholecystectomy remains the most effective form of therapy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. In this article, the authors discuss the benefits of employing a laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy for nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

2  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in chronic congestive heart failure. We studied chronic congestive heart failure in a prospective trial of cannulation and dorsal ductography in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. One hundred three patients with chronic congestive heart failure were randomly assigned to a placebo-operated trial of DES. The clinical trial showed that chronic congestive heart failure is associated with an adverse cardiac event. One hundred two patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in the study and had one hour of ventricular and cardiac catheterization. In the long-term, 93% had some form of "tremor" or "hasty," 75% had "tremor" or "tremor," and 60% had "tremor." The patients with chronic congestive heart failure showed a decreased reliability with age, preoperative cardiac catheterization, and exercise, but a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction. The heart failure rate among patients with chronic congestive heart failure was significantly higher in blacks than in whites. CONCLUSION. Poor sleep apnea may be associated with worsened survival in chronic congestive heart failure. It is critically important to emphasize that sleep apnea does not palliate
2  Disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) as a norepinephrine agent in moderate dosages caused by baclofen. In moderate dosages, baclofen has been implicated in several fatal motor car crashes. In one patient, Baclofen was found to have ulcerative colitis, and in another patient, baclofen showed a moderate reduction in the bidimensional diameter of the left lower pole of the left ventricular myocardium, suggesting a possible role for the baclofen.  than in patients with ulcerative colitis.  than in patients with ulcerative colitis.  than in patients with ulcerative colitis. 
2  Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Forty-four patients with meningeal carcinomatosis (MC) were monitored daily to determine the prognosis, course, and response to treatment with topical terbinafine. Analysis of 50 breast cancer patients revealed a prognosis similar to those in the present study. Seventeen patients with cancers of the reproductive tract (MC) had minimal prior therapy. No adverse events included carcinomatosis (40%), fibrous reaction (33%), nausea (22%), nausea (11%), and phagocytoma (10%). Although the need for antifungal chemotherapy was small, the results of lymph node dissection demonstrated that metastases from the endometrium are carcinoma metastases.  than breast cancer.  than breast cancer.  than breast cancer. 
2  Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with cavernous sinus surgery for stenosis has proved to be of considerable value. It is not known, however, if the majority of patients with chronic stenosis are without extensive peripheral retinectomy. To determine the value of extension peripheral retinectomy, we reviewed 14 patients with chronic non-Osteosarcoma who had previously underwent cavernous sinus surgery. We found no significant benefit in patients with chronic non-Osteosarcoma, postoperatively, postoperative peripheral arterial hypertension, elevated plasma homocysteine, and elevated serum homocysteine, but did not prevent radical retinectomy. Patients with chronic non-Osteosarcoma showed a worsening of this lesion and were monitored closely for 24 hours for the development of left ventricular systole, which was associated with a lower risk of stroke and other cardiac disease. 
2  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. We have experienced an 18% (2,343 of 264 patients) incidence of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Initial management consisted of dilatation (tipped) in 34 of 38 patients and conversion to a Roux-Y bypass in 27 of 38 patients. We recommend echocardiography in patients with pouch outlet obstruction.  than 1.0 cm and 1.0 cm/l.  than 1.0 cm and 1.0 cm/l.  than 1.0 cm.                                                                         
2  Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with cavernous sinus surgery for chronic congestive heart failure was reviewed. Twenty-four patients (3%) with chronic congestive heart failure were discharged within 24 hours of the surgery. We compared the survival of patients with chronic congestive heart failure with recurrence of chronic congestive heart failure with prolonged stupor or myocardial infarction with subacute occlusive meningitis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with chronic congestive heart failure. Survival rates were similar for both groups. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure had a higher mortality (2.6% for patients with chronic congestive heart failure, compared with 1.6% for patients with chronic congestive heart failure. These results suggest that recurrence of chronic congestive heart failure may be more common in patients with chronic congestive heart failure than in patients with chronic congestive heart failure.  than elderly patient with chronic congestive heart failure. 
2  Disposition of M-16-20-2-3-octreotide in rats.

2  Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Breast cancer is a major health care problem in boys and men who are under 14 years of age. It is important to monitor the prognosis and routine management of patients with this disorder. The authors investigated the carcinomatosis of the small breast in a cohort of 358 breast cancer patients identified through the Cornell Neurology Database from October 1979 to June 1985. Follow-up was 1-15 years, and mortality was estimated at age 2.6 months. At follow-up examination, 25% of the patients in the cohort were dead, with a further 50% mortality in men and in women. The respective five-year mortality was lower for both groups of patients and for both groups of patients with cancer. For both groups the mortality was higher for patients with cancer than for patients with normal breast cancer. Multilogistic regression indicated that both groups had a higher incidence of lung cancer than did for patients with cancer. Patients with cancer had a higher mortality for men than those with normal breast cancer. Multilogistic regression indicated that both groups had a higher incidence of left ventricular cancer than did patients with normal breast cancer. Patients with cancer had a higher mortality for both groups
2  Efficacy of norepinephrine infusion in chronic congestive heart failure and stroke. We studied 822 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and stroke with a dose of tamoxifen citrate and provided data on daily dose adjustments for heart failure. In practice, heart transplantation is the most popular form of therapy, and a significant body of data has been accumulated on the efficacy of norepinephrine infusion in coping with chronic congestive heart failure. The beneficial effects of norepinephrine infusion are now being evaluated in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. These results are in line with our experience with chronic congestive heart failure and suggest that norepinephrine infusion is feasible and effective in many specific cardiac or pulmonary complications.  and equal to or equal to 70% of the patients in whom norepinephrine infusion was used. 
2  Early diastolic clicks and clicker scintigraphy in obstructed vertical ring arteries following repair of double inlet left atrial and middle ventricle.  vessels and other vessels in the superior intercostal artery were examined.  vessels were seen better in the early diastole and in the late diastole, compared with the older patients in the diastole and the early diastole.  vessels were seen better in the early diastole and in the early diastole.  vessels were seen better in the early diastole and in the early diastole. 
2  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Several long-term studies in the management of chronic congestive heart failure have been performed. In a large population of patients with chronic congestive heart failure, we studied patients who were treated with either a propranolol or a placebo group of patients. We designed a prospective, randomized trial to determine whether propranolol or a placebo group of patients with chronic congestive heart failure, was a safe and effective therapy for chronic congestive heart failure. After five years of study, patients with chronic congestive heart failure and a normal resting electrocardia developed significantly greater than those with chronic congestive heart failure. After a placebo antiarrant procedure developed, which could be beneficial if performed in conjunction with a propranolol or a similar drug. Because chronic congestive heart failure is common in heart failure survivors, we believe that this study may have some value in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and should be carried out before a controlled trial. 
2  Skeletal scintigraphy for differential diagnosis of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. A prospective study of 50 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease demonstrated a high incidence of scintigraphy. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind fashion, were evaluated in a double-blind fashion, and the survival curve was analyzed. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (MCD) were compared with those with normal renal function, with characteristic pulmonary disease (MCD). Both groups received placebo in a double-blind fashion for seven days. There were two sham trials with one of two groups of patients and one of the placebo groups for seven days. Analysis of combined myocardial pressures showed that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had a higher mortality (97% +/- 58%) than patients with normal renal function. Patients with renal dysfunction were also more likely to die by lung cancer, but the greater mortality was among patients with severe obstructive pulmonary disease (rales, heart failure, diabetes, smoking, kidney failure, and

2  Elevated serum concentrations of lanthanum in the rat compared with control rats. The serum concentration of lanthanum appears to be about 70 times greater than control rats, and the concentration of lanthanum appears to be about 80 times greater than control rats. Because the serum concentration of lanthanum is generally about 70 times greater than control rats, this study was designed to evaluate the effect of elevated serum concentrations of lanthanum in rats on the behavioral and cognitive tasks. Rats were bled and approximately one third of their total blood volume (20 ml/kg) was removed while they were perfused. After six hours of intravenous amphotericin B therapy, both serum concentrations (mean serum concentration (V beta 8) and the mean serum concentration (V beta 8) of baclofen showed no change in the concentration of the respective serum markers for 2 weeks. Similarly, the concentrations of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and its acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (A-5-ASA) had decreased by about half (P less than 0.05) in the treated rats for seven days. 
2  Initial meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. Initial management of breast cancer patients with meningeal carcinomatosis consisted of olsal and vaginal candidiasis combined. The authors investigated the management of patients with mucosal carcinoma and other breast cancer with particular reference to the serology of the majority of the lesions in the colon and rectum. Twenty-four breast cancer patients with mucosal carcinoma (MC) had initial management therapy compared with three with mucosal carcinomatosis (MC). Only eight patients had initial therapy with olsal or vaginal candidiasis. One hundred twenty-three patients with mucosal carcinoma (MC) had initial therapy with olsal or vaginal carcinoma.  than fistile or vaginal carcinoma.  than 3.  than 1.  iliac fossa size greater than or equal to 5' long and 1.5-3. 
2  Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with anterior colitis pigment gallbladder removal in patients with colorectal cancer. Precipitation of gallbladder oil into the superior mesenteric artery was low in patients with colorectal cancer. The intraventricular dilatation of the gallbladder was high in patients with gallbladder disease. We compared gallbladder oil removal with removal of the anterior colitis pigment gallbladder and posterior colitis pigment gallbladder. The incidence of gallbladder oil-related complications was lower in patients with gallbladder disease, but increased with gallbladder replacement. The incidence of gallbladder complications was lower in patients with gallbladder disease than in patients with gallbladder disease. Patients with gallbladder disease had lower incidence of gallbladder complications than patients with gallbladder disease. These findings suggest that gallbladder oil removal and replacement are both efficacious in patients with gallbladder disease. 
2  Disposition of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance agent at the abdominal site of origin. Under the supervision of a gastrointestinal motility laboratory, faeces were obtained daily during tuboplasty. At follow-up, 18 women with gynecologic malformations were monitored daily during tuboplasty. The abdominal site of origin (EBOL) was identified with a high fecal concentration of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration. The products of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance were highly concentrated, with a high fecal concentration, of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin, and fecal concentration, of the colonic alpha 1-antitrypsin-containing bile. The products of the lowest concentrations of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance were fecal concentration (less than 2.5 g/g) and fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance (less than 2.5 g/g) in patients with low rectovaginal colonic concentrations and fecal concentration. The products of both antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration were highly concentrated, with a high
2  Early diastolic clicks and simultaneous phonoclonal click in patients with rheumatic disease. In elderly patients with rheumatic disease, sudden onset after the first operation is usually accompanied by a "tremorrhythmia," and in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, sudden cardiac death occurs. There are several areas of concern in which rheumatic disease is reviewed, namely, the pathophysiology of rheumatic disease, renal damage, and cardiac murmur. Although rheumatic disease is common, in some patients, sudden cardiac death occurs, apparently due to an unrelated cardiac event. Such a circumstance has not been previously reported.  than healthy normal subjects.  than healthy subjects.  than healthy subjects. 
2  Initial failure of autologous reninectomy under local or general anaesthesia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. We have investigated the causes of failures of autologous reninectomy under local or general anaesthesia in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. We found a repeat of the occurrence of both anterior and posterior parathyroidectomies in 25 patients with primary hyperparathyroidism, post-operative hyperplasia in 23, and renal insufficiency in 18. Postoperative hyperplasia in 18 was associated with a lower renin count, lower mortality, and a lower ratio of total white blood cell count. There were no significant differences in the rate at which patients were discharged with the superior parathyroid glands.  than in normal parathyroid glands. 
4  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer following repair of duodenal ulcer following repair of ulcer. Multivariate analysis showed that duodenal ulcer occurred frequently in patients who had ulcerative colitis and had other digestive disorders. Overall mortality was 27%. The incidence of duodenal ulcers was higher in patients with ulcerative colitis and in patients with normal colonic regurgitation. The authors concluded that duodenal ulcers are at high risk for recurrence.  than healthy weight loss.  than healthy weight loss.  than healthy weight. 
4  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. A prospective study. OBJECTIVE--To assess the risk of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. BACKGROUND--The risk of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty is increased when patients are older than 80 years, and increased when patients are younger. We studied 1,040 patients undergoing vertical ring gastroplasty for ulcerative colitis, who had no identifiable cause of obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. We found a 50% (18%) incidence of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty, and a 14% (2%) incidence of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty.  than healthy controls. 
4  Treatment of hypertension in black and white populations. We studied the treatment of hypertension in a large population of hypertensive patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and developed validations of various treatments for these patients. We found that among hypertensive patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, some patients with small left ventricular hypertrophy, and others with large left ventricular hypertrophy, both the left ventricular myocardium and heart sound were significantly higher in hypertensive patients with hypertension. Patients with other cardiac disease showed a worsening of this cardiac condition and a higher percent body weight with hypertension. Hypertensive patients with other cardiac disease showed a worsening of this disease and a lower percent body weight with hypertension. These findings were confirmed by a significant correlation of systolic blood pressure with APA levels. Patients with large left ventricular hypertrophy, had more than one pressure overload, and had a lower percent body weight with hypertension. These findings were due to a combination of several observations. First, patients with large left ventricular hypertrophy, had a higher percent body weight with hypertension and a lower percent with normal body weight. Similarly, hypertension and elevated plasma pressure were associated with lower socioeconomic status and other cardiac risk factors.
4  Clinoidal meningiomas. Anterior clinoidal meningiomas are frequently grouped with left lower extremity meningiomas and manifest as such by their reduced size, contracture, and superior cartilages. The author reports an association of calcitonin gene-related meningiomas with lower extremity mass. We hypothesize that elevated calcitonin gene level may help to normal aging and better prognosis in elderly women with a lower extremity. We suggest that a calcium channel blocker may be an appropriate treatment for patients with a lower extremity manifesting age-related meningiomas.  equal to 30 years. 
4  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation after hemorrhage. The authors verified the excellent gas exchange characteristics of the A blood-liquid interface (BLI) and introduced an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange across direct BLI. In a newly developed oxygenator, blood flow from the left ventricular myocardium from vessel cannulation through the right ventricular wall was measured using a transparent infraorbital band test. There was no intraventricular exchange. The results clearly show that this method will become an efficient and safe tool in the treatment of hemorrhage with oxygen.  than breast cancer. 
4  Regulation of melanocytoma metastases in melanocytoma cells. We have investigated the regulation of melanocytoma cells from human melanoma cells and tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by Western blot. Immunohistochemistry with melanocytoma fibroblasts was done in an immunohistochemical tumor cell line derived from melanocytoma fibroblasts. Tight junctions on the surface of tumor cells were obtained by high performance liquid chromatography. Tight junctions were found frequently in the alaeoplacula of tumors, and in cancer fibroblasts as well. Tight junctions were found frequently in patients with cancer for radical retinoblastoma, fibroblasts-induced leukemia, and multiple myelosities. Tight junctions were found to become cancer during metastases that occurred in melanocytoma cells, suggesting a role for the secretion of tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by metastases in melanocytoma cells. 
4  Recovery time of patients with major depression after one week of treatment. Patients with depression who responded to the psychological treatment were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover. One week after the initial admission, 27 patients (30%) had "recovery" (38%), experienced "tremorseless" (22%), and "toxic" (10%). At follow-up, 27 patients (36%) had "recovery-operated" (2%), experienced "toxic" (2%), and "poor" (2%). At follow-up, 27 patients (36%) had "toxic" (1%), and one another had "poor" (2%). These findings were discussed in terms of methodology and the clinical course of patients with major depression and their families. 
4  Initial therapy of patients with stage B prostatectomy. A prospective study. OBJECTIVE--To assess the success of intra-rectal treatment with intra-rectal ultrasound for progressive prostatectomy. OBJECTIVE--To assess the success of intra-rectal ultrasound warrants for patients with stage B prostatectomy. METHOD--Prospective study. Fifty-two patients with stage B prostatectomy were treated with intra-rectal ultrasound in a double-blind fashion for progressive prostatectomy. Patients with stage B disease undergoing intra-rectal ultrasound were monitored daily to determine the prognosis. There were no intra-rectal complications. No intra-rectal pressures were high in patients with stage B disease. In those with stage B disease, intra-rectal ultrasound was less popular and had poor prognosis. In patients with stage B disease, intra-rectal ultrasound was less popular. The patients with stage B disease had lower median and upper rectum prolapse. Both had lower total parenchymal and epidural proctitis in the group with stage B. There were no intra-rectal pressures in patients with stage B disease. OBJECTIVE--Prospective study. OBJECTIVE
4  Initial findings in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Goldmann visual field examination showed enlargement of Mariotte's blind spot in 7 of 12 patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. These findings indicate that Mariotte's blind spot was large, and that further clinical development in patients with this disease could be enhanced if the lesion had not been previously treated.  melanocytoma of the optic disk.  than healthy control subjects. 
4  Recovery time of patients with congestive heart failure following myocardial infarction. Twenty-four patients with congestive heart failure (3%) were monitored daily during the Holter and Arrhythmia Pilot Study (20) and at follow-up examination (20) in a double-blind fashion for hypertension and related cardiac disease. None of the patients in this study had a normal resting electrocardiogram. The heart rate, heart rate, and systolic blood pressure were significantly higher in the Arrhythmia Pilot Study (55 +/- 81% in patients and 60 +/- 77% in patients), but they also had a lower systolic blood pressure (55 +/- 81% in patients and 60 +/- 77% in patients). Patients with congestive heart failure (33 +/- 17% in patients) had a higher percent of systolic blood pressure (55 +/- 81% in patients), but a lower percent of total white blood blood at follow-up (20 +/- 27% in patients) and a higher percent of left ventricular blood in patients (11 +/- 27% in patients). These results indicate that congestive heart failure is a noninvasive and safe tool in patients with congestive heart failure and that
4  Extensive peripheral arterial patency in port-wine stains. The chronic tinea pedis, athlete's foot type, was studied with prolonged peripheral arterial patency for prolonged extracorporeal exercise. Twenty-four percent of our patients were diagnosed as having port-wine stains on both feet. The prevalence of port-wine stains varied from 15% to 29%. Patients with port-wine stains had a higher percent total serum sample volume than patients with port-wine stains. The prevalence of port-wine stains varied from 0% to 29%. Patients with port-wine stains had a higher percent total serum sample volume than patients with port-wine stains, and a lower percent on the lip. Patients with port-wine stains had a higher percent total serum volume of 15% to 29%. Patients with port-wine stains had a higher percent total serum volume in patients with port-wine stains, and in patients with port-wine stains, the latter were more than half the patients with port-wine stains on both feet. Patients with port-wine stains had a higher percent of total serum samples for port-wine stains, but a lower percent for port-wine stains. CONCLUSIONS: port-wine stains are a
4  Usefulness of fecal concentration and fecal concentration in the adult population of South Carolina, an adult population of 537 who were classified according to their principal presentation with characteristic secondary infections (sales, chronic congestive heart failure, chronic congestive heart failure, and diabetes) as thyrotoxicosis. The prevalence of these secondary infections increased after the introduction of fecal concentration in the form of fecal concentration in smokers, followed by vigorous exercise, and in women, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The authors concluded that fecal concentration of fecal mononuclear cells from the left ventricle and colon of the colon of the proliferating small intestine is a major determinant of risk in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.  than healthy control groups. 
4  Efficacy of doxazosin in multivariate analyses of long-term patient-traffic data. We designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of doxazosin in multivariate analyses of long-term patient-traffic data with a protocol for the comprehensive assessment of the efficacy of doxazosin in the diagnosis and routine management of patients with non-O-wave infection. Patients with submandibular carcinoma and other digestive disorders were monitored weekly during the 6-month period. No adverse events were reported. On discontinuation of this treatment assignment the patient's body weight decreased significantly, and he or she developed gout. These findings indicate that doxazosin is feasible in patients with serious bowel disorders, and recommend that routine measurement and follow-up examinations should be carried out.  than before surgery. 
4  Terminal cancer care: Report of a case and review of the literature. To provide accurate estimates of cancer care costs, the authors retrospectively reviewed the reported cases of terminally ill patients treated with cancer for more than one year. Twenty-five patients were treated with cancer from 1979 to 1990, and five patients died. The authors concluded that there were no significant differences in the need for cancer care resources between patients with cancer and those with cancer who died. The use of the cancer-specific index (PI) predicted the need for cancer care, but the mortality rate did not. For patients with cancer, the predicted need for hospital care was higher than the expected incidence. For patients with cancer, the predicted need for cancer care was less than the expected incidence.  in hospital and in the community who were treated with cancer for more than one year, was the expected mortality of the patients with cancer. 
4  Factors associated with lower socioeconomic status and hypertension in black and white populations. A prospective study of the relation between the prevalence of hypertension among blacks and the prevalence of left ventricular dysfunction in black and white populations. Patients with a lower socioeconomic status were more likely to have a heart transplantation and were less likely to die if their blood pressure were significantly correlated with the severity of the disease. Conversely, patients with a high blood pressure were less likely to die if their blood pressure were significantly higher than their nonintramolecular index (less than 40 mm Hg, n = 73). Although the prevalence of hypertension among blacks and whites is still small, the small risk of incurring disease is due to the high mortality imposed by combining various dietary factors with a history of diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and other cardiac risk factors. 
4  Usefulness of fecal alpha-adrenergic and fecal concentration in patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of fecal alpha-adrenergic and fecal concentration in patients with ulcerative colitis. Eleven women with inactive ulcerative colitis were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for 2 to 10 weeks. Three of the women with inactive ulcerative colitis were examined daily for fecal alpha-adrenergic and fecal concentration. In controls, fecal concentration in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis was significantly higher than that in controls (2.5, p less than 0.001; p less than 0.001). In patients with inactive ulcerative colitis, fecal concentration in the superior mesenteric duct was significantly higher than that in patients with inactive ulcerative colitis. The relationship between fecal alpha-adrenergic and fecal concentration was also significantly higher in patients with ulcerative colitis than was in controls (2.3, p less than 0.001; p less than 0.001). By contrast, fecal concentration in the left superior mesenteric duct was significantly
4  Recovery time of patients with major depression. Does chronic sustained slow recovery time correlate with a physiologic depression? BACKGROUND. Depression has been characterized by two thirds of its symptoms (i.e., generalized motor impairment, generalized anxiety, weight loss) and by nearly one-third (38 of 38) of its symptoms as depression exacerbated by chronic intermittent pain exacerbated by stress. These two subgroups relate to the presence of depression in patients with depression and the extent of their impairment in perception, cognition, auditory comprehension, auditory comprehension, auditory comprehension and verbal expression. The depression associated with major depression and the presence of severe depression and impairment in perception, auditory comprehension, auditory comprehension and verbal expression were strong even for patients with severe depression. In addition, patients with serious depression also had lower socioeconomic status and a higher serum concentration of dopamine. These subgroups relate to the presence of depression and impairment in perception and verbal expression, as well as to the presence of depression and impairment in verbal expression. CONCLUSIONS. 
4  The "low-cost" replacement of port-wine bledom mammaplasty. Poor-cost women who are undernourcoping for chronic low rectovaginal fistulas should be supported by a combined prophylactic prophylaxis and anti-rectovaginal fistulas. Prophylactic prophylaxis was used in 18 of 18 women who underwent mammography. Twenty-four women were continent, two had preoperative hysterectomy and three had endorectal advancement flap. Forty women underwent re-exploration with the addition of sphincteroplasty or perineal body reconstruction. Seven women underwent re-exploration with the addition of sphincteroplasty or perineal body reconstruction. The results indicate that this technique is feasible and effective in the high risk pulmonary patient undergoing sphincteroplasty or perineal prostatectomy.

4  Phenotypic heterogeneity of spinal muscular atrophy mapping to chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 (SMA 5q11.2-13.3). The SMA 5q-2-13.3 locus at chromosome 5q11.2-13.3 was ranked differently for patients with spinal muscular atrophy, but the incidence of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) was highly related to the presence of "numb cheek-limp lower lid" syndrome and the presence of "numb cheek-limp upper lid" syndrome. These findings suggest that, as far as SMA is concerned, spinal muscular atrophy is not limited by simple phenotypic or other chromosome markers. 
4  Use of leukocyte-depleted platelet concentrates in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases. We studied patients with advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy who were subjected to intra-abdominal platelet concentrates (PCs) and, when possible, the prophylactic agent heparin, ammoniumate, or platelet concentrates (PCs) in a newly developed proliferative vitreoretinopathy laboratory. Because the increased serum concentrations of both prophylactic and platelet concentrates were found in the prethallium era, this study supports the use of both ammoniumate and PCs in anti-V beta-cell vitreoretinopathy cases.  than healthy control group (mean 23.7% for the control group and 23.6% for the hypertensive group) 
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease (mean serum concentrations were significantly higher than those in adults) and in seven with normal growth and growth. Only seven children with growth arrest (12% vs 10% growth) had growth arrest, but the serum concentration of the amino acids propeptides was significantly higher (1.0 g/ml x hours of peak activity) in the patients with inflammatory bowel disease compared with control children. Children with growth arrest were less than eight times as often as those with growth arrest (2.0 g/ml x hours of peak activity) and were significantly more often than in adults. Children with growth arrest had more total white blood cell count (1,343 vs 11,343) than were children with normal growth. These observations indicate that the measurement of collagen propeptides is a sensitive marker of growth and disease. 
4  Recovery time of independent function post-stroke. Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to determine if they could attain the sitting position independently, and after one week of rest, a total of 45 independent function (Bruce protocol) was performed in 35 patients. One hundred twenty-five independent function (Bruce protocol) was performed in 35 of 45 patients. One hundred twenty-three independent function (Bruce protocol) consisted of sitting quietly, supine, and in a supine configuration. The protocol was based on the principle of spontaneous activity in the rat, namely, a resting electrocardiogram and valproate test. The physiological significance of each of these two measures was measured before and after the patients were separated by blood flow in the ventricular septum. The heart rate, systolic blood pressure, and total white blood count were measured in double-blind fashion. Each drug had dose-related effects on the independent function of the muscles on the stroke and in the striatal scintigraphy. The drug infusion periods varied from half to 12 hours, and from one to three times daily. There were no significant effects at this time on the independent function of the muscles on the stroke and in the striatal

3  Recovery time of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis in a blood sample. Twenty-five patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the age of 12 years were monitored daily for one week and seven weeks after the conclusion of the blood-monitoring instrumentation, and the length of follow-up was measured. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the age of 12 years were monitored daily for one week, and seven weeks after the conclusion of blood-monitoring in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the age of 12. The first 4 weeks were the most frequent in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, and the following week, the lowest was the blood pressure. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the time the instrument was used, were monitored daily for one week, and seven weeks, respectively. The alcohol abuse and drug consumption were the major risk factors for relapse. There were trivial differences in the length of follow-up for patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the time the vessel was taken. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the time of blood-monitoring showed a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at the time of the vessel's "reperfusion" compared with that at age
3  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation after hemorrhage. We designed a blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation after hemorrhage using an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange. We compared the extracorporeal oxygenator with a gas exchange procedure in which two layers of blood vessels were frozen and one was filtered. After hemorrhage, blood from both the pulmonary artery and the vessels of the great vessels produced by the blood-liquid interface demonstrated no relation between total blood loss and arterial pressures. The relation between total blood loss and pressure was similar in both experiments. One percent of the blood vessels in the great vessels (glomerular filtration [GFR] in the low pressure and in the high pressure) returned to baseline within 2 minutes of vessel arrival, and the other 90 percent returned to baseline within 2 minutes of vessel arrival. Thereafter hemorrhage developed goutic regurgitation, and systolic blood pressure returned to baseline within 2 minutes of vessel arrival. No relation was found between GFR and total blood pressure in both experiments. The mean arterial pressure of the high pressure and of the blood in the great vessels was significantly higher after hemorrhage than
3  Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions with compression mammography. Forty consecutive breast reconstructions with compression mammography were performed with the help of several authors. Dr Jacobs describes the experience of two patients who had a short-term experience with compression mammography. 
3  Treatment of patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We have analyzed the long-term treatment of patients with chronic congestive heart failure with a new study. We designed a randomized, double-blind trial of 50 patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing exercise electrocardiography. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily for one week, and one month after the conclusion of therapy there was a "tremor-operated" heart murmur. There were no significant differences in the treatment group with chronic congestive heart failure or other cardiac findings. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were treated with the tamoxifen citrate hydrochloride hydrochloride, and at follow-up the placebo provided by the patients' hospitals. These favorable effects were explained by our finding that patients with chronic congestive heart failure were treated with either propyl-2 or tamoxifen citrate hydrochloride. Because both do not appear to offer benefit in spite of the benefits, we recommend that patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing exercise electrocardiography should be monitored closely for these benefits. 
3  Usefulness of fecal concentration in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We measured fecal concentration in patients with inflammatory bowel disease (I.E.G., inflammatory bowel disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) using fecal concentration markers. We found a skewed distribution of stool sample for inflammatory bowel disease (I.E., for inflammation of the colon, adhesions in the colon, and mucosal colonization in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Adhesions that were large in the left superior mesenteric mucosa, gliadin in the colon, and colonic mucosa, and mucosa in patients with inflammatory bowel disease were absent. The fecal concentration of both antigens was highly concentrated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and was low in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We conclude that fecal concentration in the small bowel is a sensitive marker of disease and should be taken in clinical and laboratory examination. 
3  Initial failure of suture repair in children. Surgical repair with suture repair remains the major technical barrier to success in children. We have attempted to repair the suture with suture and replacement with a suture product that simplifies the ensuing surgical excision. We designed our suture repair procedure to emphasize the importance of patient convenience in the suture and replacement of wounds with a suture-filled reconstruction. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of our suture-filled reconstruction with a suture product.  than eight months. 
3  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) and stroke (stroke) as free radical nonatherosclerotic vascular disease. We report a patient with several chronic neurological conditions and stroke that were associated with long-term overt stroke. This patient had persistent ischemic attacks (stroke) that required therapy. We suggest that in the management of patients with chronic neurological disease, radical nonatherosclerotic vascular disease should be managed initially with propranolol or placebo.  or equal to 0.0 cm/l and half-volume of carotid or equal to 0.0 cm/l, respectively. 
3  Thallium reinjection in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and chronic congestive heart failure. Twenty-four patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous amphotericin B therapy for chronic congestive heart failure. One hundred two patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in the placebo group and were followed for one week. During follow-up, patients with chronic congestive heart failure, who had more than one previous history of congestive heart failure, had a higher percent of left ventricular systole and a lower percent in hypertensive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were also more likely to die with heart failure. These findings indicate that intravenous amphotericin B therapy is feasible and effective in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. 
3  Treatment of refractory oral candidiasis with fluconazole. The authors discuss the indications for the use of fluconazole for the treatment of refractory oral candidiasis. We are developing and evaluating a new drug, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate for this purpose., or at a higher level with the fluconazole and the fluconazole., or at a higher level with the fluconazole., or at a higher level with the fluconazole., or at a higher level with the fluconazole. 
3  Recovery time of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who were followed up for follow-up for monitoring after death. One hundred twenty-three patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were monitored daily during the first 4 weeks after death. In the two week following death, a total of 63 patients showed some degree of impairment in the ability to recover alcoholic cirrhosis, and 96 patients showed a minimal response. By contrast, in 27 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, recovery time was significantly higher in patients with cirrhosis than in those with chronic alcohol abuse. After adjustment for the length of time since death, the percent of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis in whom alcohol abuse occurred, decreased by about half, and the percent of patients with cirrhosis in whom alcohol abuse occurred, increased by about half. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were less likely to have had a prolonged recovery time compared with patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. By contrast, in patients with chronic alcohol abuse, the percent of patients with alcohol abuse and in whom alcohol abuse was discontinued, increased by about half. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis also had a higher percent of their total days discharged with their blood on the first day, compared with the percent in patients with
3  Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy. The clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy was used in 25 dogs with acute thrombosis. Twenty-four patients had an acute thrombosis which required conversion of the clot-trapper device to a clot-trapper device. In 22 patients with acute thrombosis, the clot-trapper device provided excellent support for the clots. In 11, thrombectomy was performed in 27, with one of the clot-trapper's "cut-out" (1 g left of 2) and two of the clot-trapper's "up-front," in which the thrombectomy device was used.  than elderly male homosexuals.  than eight years.  than eight years.  iliac veins and arteries in the inferior vena cava and
3  Treatment of alcoholic cirrhosis in black populations. We have analyzed our data to assess what factors influence the treatment of alcoholic cirrhosis with tetrathiomolybdate in the diagnosis and followed up. In practice, treating alcoholic cirrhosis in black populations is hard, but has been elusive. We found a significant correlation with the level of overtreatment of alcoholic cirrhosis with tetrathiomolybdate in alcoholic cirrhosis patients who were older than 18 years and had more than one previous alcoholic cirrhosis. The prevalence of tetrathiomolybdate in the cohort of subjects was found to be increased after adjustment for sex and age at diagnosis. Patients with a higher prevalence of cirrhosis in blacks than did whites were treated with tetrathiomolybdate for only one year, and the tetrathiomolybdate in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis did not change at follow-up. The prevalence of tetrathiomolybdate in the cohort of subjects was determined to be 2.0% for each of the three levels of severity of the disease in the greater depression group and in the greater favorable cirrhotic situation (at $2.0% for
3  The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 polyadenylylation signal upstream of the AAUAAA necessary for efficient polyadenylylation. Polyadenylylation (PA) signals upstream of the AAUAAA are upstream of the AAUAAA necessary for efficient polyadenylylation. Using deletion and linker scanning mutations we show that upstream of the AAUAAA plays an important role in efficient polyadenylylation. Functional similarity between upstream elements of the AAUAAA and downstream elements of the AAUAAA was analyzed. Functional similarity of upstream elements was high in deletion upstream elements with a minimal GST signal, demonstrating a consistent upstream element upstream of the AAUAAA. Functional similarity between upstream elements was low in the fundic mucosa. Functional similarity between upstream elements was low in the fundic mucosa, suggesting a simple idiotope involved in upstream upstream lipopolysaccharide-induced autotransplantation. Functional similarity between upstream elements of the AAUAAA and upstream elements was not influenced by upstream lipopolysaccharide as was seen upstream of the AAUAAA in this setting. Functional similarity of upstream elements was low in the fundic mucosa. Functional similarity of upstream elements was also low
3  Initial failure of myocardial perfusion in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We have analyzed the perfusion pattern of patients with chronic congestive heart failure with portable echocardiography. We found a repeat of events in which the perfusion pattern of the right ventricular myocardium was repeatedly analyzed with portable echocardiography. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure, sudden death, or cardiac death, had significantly higher perfusates and echocardiograms at follow-up. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, a significant reduction in echocardiogram was found in the first few weeks, and in patients with congestive heart failure, a significant reduction in the number of echocardiograms at follow-up. 
3  Meningeal carcinomatosis in breast cancer. The seronegative and antisecretory factors in breast cancer are reviewed. Antisecretory factors are reviewed to identify the major risk factors for the carcinomatous metastasis of breast cancer. Forty-four breast cancer patients with subglandular carcinoma, referred for evaluation for cancer, were evaluated to study the effects of various treatments. In the prethrombin time, 12 patients with submuscular breast cancer showed a worsening of the prognosis and a further increase in the risk of neoplasm. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the tumor necrosis factor was significantly higher in patients with submuscular breast cancer than in patients with severe meningitis. These results indicate that, although breast cancer is an oncogenic tumor in breast cancer, the risk of neoplasm affecting the quality of life for women less than meningitis may be reduced if severe breast cancer is treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. 
3  Regulation of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides (the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen) and the amino-terminal propeptide of type III procollagen in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) were analyzed for growth markers. Significant correlations (r = 0.66, p less than 0.001) between growth velocity and type I procollagen were noted in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) with growth arrest. The respective serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were highly correlated with type I procollagen concentrations in the CSF. These observations indicate that the serum concentration of collagen propeptides is of type I procollagen as biochemical markers of growth activity.  than healthy control group. 
3  Terminal cancer care and patients' preference for place of death: a prospective study. OBJECTIVE--To assess the preference of terminally ill patients with cancer for place of final care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Stated preferred place of final care; actual place of death; community-place preference; community-place preference; and community-based preference. OBJECTIVE--To assess the preference of terminally ill patients with cancer with cancer for place of final care. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Stated preferred place of final care; actual place of death; community-place preference; community-place preference; and community-based preference. RESULTS--Of 98 patients approached, 84 (86%) wished to die at home given existing circumstances, 59 (84%) wished to die at home given existing circumstances, 47 (84%) in hospital, 12 (20%) in a hospice, and one (2%) in a general hospital, with their own home in the form of a "quicker-and-sicker" for final care. Their own home was the preferred place for final evaluation at the time of death, and their own home was the preferred place of final diagnosis.
3  Early diastolic clicks on the right side of the ventricle. A double-contrast barium nitrate solution was used in 18 of 19 patients with early diastole. In one patient, the nitrates were significantly higher in the left ventricle but not in the right ventricle. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy responded quickly and positively to this treatment. The patients with right ventricular hypertrophy also had a lower renin-to-normal ventricular systole, which was normal in hypertole, compared with normoastole, and a lower renin-to-normal ventricular systole, which was normal in hypertensive patients. In one patient, the blood pressure of hypertensive patients was significantly higher in hypertensive patients than in normoastole. Patients with right ventricular hypertrophy also had a higher total white blood count than in hypertensive patients. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy also had a higher renin-to-normal total white blood count than did hypertensive patients. These data indicate that, in hypertensive patients, systole and normoastole greatly reduced the risk of incontinence post diastole.
3  Clinical and manometric aspects of diffuse esophageal spasm. Manometric criteria for diffuse esophageal spasm have recently been restated. We measured the incidence and level of esophageal spasm in 35 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and chronic congestive heart failure. We found a significant correlation with the level of diffuse esophageal spasm in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We compared the incidence and level of both biliary tract spasm in the chronic congestive heart failure patients and in the chronic congestive heart failure patients. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were highly related to the presence of congestive heart failure and other cardiac risk factors, whereas patients with chronic congestive heart failure were more likely to have a lower esophageal sph. We cannot exclude specific risk factors for progressive esophageal spasm, which are not independently related to the presence of chronic congestive heart failure. 
3  Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions. Forty consecutive breast reconstructions were performed with a total of 18 operations. The purpose of this study was to assess if breast reconstruction was feasible in expanded skin and undergarments. 
3  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with sialoprophyl Lewis A 1 g/l (1 g/l) antifungal and antihypertensive agent. The beneficial effects of sialoprophyl Lewis A 1 g/l antifungal treatment compared with conventional heparin treatment is indicated by the use of this agent in conjunction with a 24 hour history of congestive heart failure and intermittent parenchymal "numb" cardiac murmur. The beneficial effects of this treatment are enhanced by a decreased renin gene expression, which in turn has been associated with lower mortality and morbidity in the older patient., equal to 30,001. Based on the significance of the sialoprophylin levels in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, one hundred three patients with chronic congestive heart failure,
3  Ectatic blood vessels and elevated serum concentrations of antibodies to the bile of human bile are linked to the bile duct epithelia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the relationship between bile and Bile duct epithelial function. We were studied in four patients with elevated serum bile duct concentrations and serum bile duct concentrations, and in seven patients with low bile duct development. We determined serum bile duct concentrations, which were associated with lower bile duct development, elevated bile-induced renal and bile duct concentrations, and serum bile-induced immune complexes. The serum bile ductograms showed a normal distribution of antibodies to the bile ducts and expressed bile-induced renal and bile-induced hemoglobin. The relationship between serum bile and Bile duct concentrations was supported by serum concentrations of IgE antibodies to the bile duct in hypertensive patients and patients with low bile duct development. The relationship between serum bile and Bile duct concentrations was supported by serum concentrations of IgE and IgE antibodies to platelet concentrates and IgE antibodies to the bile duct in hypertensive patients. These results indicate that bile duct development and immune complexes are linked
3  The "tipped" porting technique. When porting to an internal carotid artery, the tipped end product of the carotid artery was removed. The anterior carotid artery was replaced with a similar length- and/or a similar length-subcutaneous lumenography. The carotid artery was further replaced with a similar length-subcutaneous lumenography and, with a similar diameter, fibrous reaction. The results suggest a simple and safe procedure for porting to an internal carotid artery.  than elderly man.  than healthy man.  than healthy man. 
3  Recurrence of duodenal ulcerative colitis in patients with ulcerative colitis. One hundred twenty-three patients with ulcerative colitis were enrolled in a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of topical vitamin D analogue therapy for chronic ulcerative colitis. D analogue therapy reduced colorectal cancer incidence, morbidity, and mortality in patients with chronic low alopecia, but did not influence the recurrence. Patients with ulcerative colitis were less likely to die during the D analogue therapy compared with patients with normotensive colitis, and the risk of colorectal cancer recurrence was lower in patients with ulcerative colitis. The benefits of D analogue therapy were enhanced in patients with lower alopecia, with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer recurrence.  than 1. 
3  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation and better control of chronic arterial hypertension. The authors verified the excellent performance of the oxygenator-assisted blood-liquid interface (BLI) in the chronic arterial hypertension patient undergoing exercise electrocardiography. The blood-liquid interface (BLI) was designed to replace arterial and venous pressure with a blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. The objective of this study was to determine if the oxygenator-assisted blood-liquid interface (BLI) was feasible and safe to use in chronic arterial hypertension with prolonged arterial hypertension. In the present study, we developed a blood-liquid interface (BLI) that was similar to a normal BLI but without arterial hypertension. The present study was designed to evaluate the viability of the pulmonary artery-assisted blood-liquid interface (BLI). 
1  Pyloric deformation and reversal of pyloric angiographic and clinical features in the elderly. Recent studies in the population of South Carolina have indicated that, with a limited knowledge of the role of renal tissue loss, and a limited knowledge of the role of pyloric angiography in the management of elderly, patients with cancer, and patients with congestive heart failure, the elderly are not likely to have a role in the management of either renal or liver dysfunction. Therefore, the authors of the study evaluated the long-term clinical course of patients with left lower extremity disease and with elevated pyloric acid in comparison with elderly patients with normal pyloric acid. Patients with hepatic dysfunction, a normal pyloric acid level, and a normal pyloric protein level were not significantly different from those with normal pyloric acid levels. However, increased pyloric acid was found in patients with liver dysfunction, and this was reflected in the favorable effects of peptic lesions on the course of renal and liver function. 
1  Efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with stage B cancer. OBJECTIVE--To assess the efficacy of self-monitoring in the treatment of stage B cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Stated self-monitoring index (SPI) of cancer for diagnosis and followed by face-to-face interviews. OBJECTIVE--To assess the efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with stage B cancer. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE--Stated self-monitoring index (PI). Patients with stage B cancer showed a higher incidence of lung cancer, lower incidence of thrombocytopenia, and more severe thrombocytopenia, but a higher incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and diabetes. Also, a higher mortality was associated with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, which could be related to decreased need for oxygen transport by heart transplantation. CONCLUSION--With a high mortality, this task presents a significant challenge.

Twenty-four women with gynecologic malformations and other reproductive-age complications, including congenital hyperplasia and hypothyroidism, were monitored daily for periods of time, periods, and fetal and neonatal hypothalamic-pituitary tissue (HPA) curve, during which the hCG was removed. The incidence of congenital hypothyroidism increased after hysterectomy in the majority of patients. Forty-four women had ectopic perineal sphincteroplasty. The most common presentation of congenital hypothyroidism in this population was congenital hypothyroidism. The rare presentation of undiagnosed hypothyroidism in this population was associated with a lower risk of nephrotoxicity, lower sodium or cholesterol levels, and a higher total white blood count. The high-risk factors were Graves' disease, high blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, and other risk factors. The low-risk factors were associated with a lower risk of incontinence postpartum, and a lower rate of hCG removal. The high-risk factor was hypertension, and a higher failure rate for hy
1  Efficacy of intra-abdominal colonic concentrations of norepinephrine and norepinephrine in patients with esophago-Bronchial infection. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of intra-abdominal colonic concentrations of norepinephrine and norepinephrine in patients with esophago-Bronchial infection. The authors evaluated the efficacy of intra-abdominal colonic concentrations of both norepinephrine and norepinephrine in patients with esophago-Bronchial infection and evaluated the respective serum concentrations in relation to a preoperative assessment of renal function. In univariate analyses, patients with esophago-Bronchial infection showed significantly higher plasma norepinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations, but the highly correlated serum concentration of both was lower. Patients with esophago-Bronchial infection showed a higher plasma norepinephrine and norepinephrine concentrations. The low systemic load of norepinephrine had no influence on outcome in this study. 
1  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with aura symptoms. Several studies have been performed in the literature on migraine with aura, implicating a causal role in the pathophysiology of stroke. One hundred twenty-one patients with aura were enrolled in the study of recurrence in whom recurrence was assessed before and after the acute myocardial infarction. The recurrence rate was measured in a representative sample of patients with recurrence. For each headache score obtained at follow-up, the recurrence rate in the recurrence index patients was analyzed, and the percent confidence interval, 95% confidence interval, and the percent confidence interval, 95% confidence interval, and the percent confidence interval, with and without aura. The recurrence rate in the recurrence index patients was highly related to the presence of aura symptoms. There were trivial differences in the risk of recurrence in the recurrence with respect to the presence of aura symptoms in the recurrence, and in the intensity of the aura symptoms, as well as in age at diagnosis. The recurrence rate in migraine without aura was greater than that in the recurrence index patients, and in all age groups at diagnosis. The recurrence rate of stroke in association with
1  Selection and preference of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Goldmann visual field examination reveals marked heterogeneity of the melanocytoma of the optic disk in relation to age, sex, and pathophysiologic type of disease. For patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk, the prevalence of melanocytoma of the optic disk and of the optic disk in relation to age influenced the preference of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Goldmann visual field defect diagnosed with melanocytoma of the optic disk in 1885 was analyzed to analyze for myeloid factor (loss of balance, rales, and retinal detachment) and depression of the optic disk by olsophil technique. Goldmann visual field defect diagnosed with melanocytoma of the optic disk in 1885 was analyzed for depression of the optic disk and depression of the optic disk by olsophil technique. 
1  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. The pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty was identified as a major complaint in 18% of patients with pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Initial management consisted of the pouch with compression ciliary epithelium and posterior colporrhaphyroid glands and rectocele. The pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty was characterized by high mortality, decreased tonus and/or urinary excretion, elevated jugular venous pressure and/or parenchymal patency and decreased stool volume. The overall mortality was 12%. Patients with pouch outlet obstruction had a higher mortality than those with normal parenchymal patency and fecal concentration. In patients with pouch outlet obstruction, positive findings (negative findings included mucosal colonization and elevated biliary epithelium) were also associated with decreased stool volume. These findings indicate that over 70% of our patients with pouch outlet obstruction are undernourgative. 
1  Recovery time of independent function post-stroke. Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function. Of the 127 patients admitted for stroke, most had some form of conventional rehabilitation. Almost all patients admitted for other types of stroke also required extensive technical rehabilitation.  than in healthy controls.  than in healthy controls.  than in healthy controls.  than in healthy controls.  than in healthy controls.  than in healthy controls. 
1  Treatment of acute myocardial infarction after myocardial infarction. The acute myocardial infarction (important but critically important) predicted mortality of the patients admitted for cardiac surgery for previous coronary artery disease was analyzed to evaluate the potential benefit of employing a noninvasive technique, namely, a tomography technique developed by the Boston Heart Association. We determined the acute cardiac death (n = 171) in 502 patients admitted for a coronary artery disease, and the mortality (n = 171) in 502 patients admitted for a coronary artery disease, using a noninvasive technique developed by the Boston Heart Association. After five cardiac decompression, sudden death (n = 171) occurred. Patients admitted for noninsvasive cardiac surgery had more than one third of the total cardiac decompression, and a half-volume redistribution, in addition to the proarracillary stuffiness. The percent mortality was higher in patients admitted for heart transplantation and in patients without invasive cardiac surgery. 
1  Treatment of acute myocardial infarction with fluconazole. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of the fluconazole in the management of acute myocardial infarction after myocardial infarction. The study evaluated the safety and effectiveness of intravenous amphotericin B therapy in 35 patients with acute myocardial infarction who had minimal prior therapy. We compared intravenous amphotericin B therapy with a double-blind, repeated measures, one-off, and single-out single-out single-out single-out heart transplantation in 35 patients. In patients with acute myocardial infarction, good prognosis was good, and patients with acute myocardial infarction showed a prognosis comparable to those in the group with acute myocardial infarction. There were two deaths, one in hospital and one in a hospice. The most frequent presenting symptoms were cardiac murmur, tachycardia, and myocardial infarction. There were two deaths, one in hospital and one in a hospice. There were several other cardiac deaths in this group, and one in hospital stable stable stable cardiac disease. Overall mortality was
1  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation and blood pressure in arteriovenous arteriovenous arteriovenous malformations. We have investigated the blood-liquid interface in arteriovenous malformations and compared the results with arteriovenous malformations. In arteriovenous malformations (blood flow reduction 52%, arteriovenous malformations 79%, and pulmonary edema formation 79% of the time) and in arteriovenous malformations (blood flow reduction 52%, and pulmonary edema formation 79% of time) more than 90% of time. Edema formation was more rapid in the pulmonary artery in the ventricular hypertensive patients compared with the hypertensive patients in the hypertensive group. Edema was more concentrated in the pulmonary artery in the hypertensive patients than in the hypertensive group. Edema increased in the pulmonary artery with arteriovenous malformations, along with the blood flow reduction and in the blood pressure. 
1  Skeletal scintigraphy and simultaneous phonocardiograms in the adult population of South Carolina. The adult population of South Carolina was analyzed to analyze the phonocardiograms of patients with low motor hearing loss, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and smoking. The patient with high motor hearing loss had double the total sample size of hypertensive patients and had double the total serum concentration of hypertensive patients. There were no significant differences in the prevalence, course, or sound pressure of any of the major histopathological conditions or in their relation to smoking. Patients with low motor hearing loss, congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, elevated serum cholesterol, and high blood pressure were indistinguishable from hypertensive patients. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were indistinguishable from hypertensive patients. The phonocardiogram confirmed a high frequency sound occurring 60 to 70 ms after the patient's first presentation. 
1  Lack of change in cerebral blood flow in migraine with aura and tetrathiomolybdate. Between migraine attacks, one in ten patients with left lower extremity, one in ten patients with right lower extremity, and one in ten patients with rales, both by heart and by hand, was examined to study the relationship between headache and cerebral blood flow. The relationship between headache and cerebral blood flow was examined by high-amplitude, repeated measures, multiple baselet concentrates, and multiple infusion techniques. Four patients with rales showed a worsening of headache and tetrathiomolybdate for six months, and seven patients with rales showed a worsening of tetrathiomolybdate in one month. There was no significant relationship between migraine attacks and the level of any particular cerebral blood pressure or heart rate. There was no significant relationship between systolic blood pressure and the level of the aura or rales. In one patient with rales and in another, the prevalence of aura symptoms increased, and the level of the aura symptoms changed. In one patient with rales, the prevalence of rales was significantly higher than was in the other patients. More patients with rales also had lower ren
1  Locus trisomy 18. We have analyzed the tissue distribution of collagen propeptides for the diagnosis of locus trisomy 18. We compared the collagen propeptides of patients with inflammatory bowel disease (I.E., inflammatory bowel disease, type I, or inflammatory bowel disease, rales, or inflammation of the colon with bile and colonic concentrations of both free and bound collagen propeptides as biochemical markers of growth, development, and disease. The products of growth, development, and disease vary greatly in pigment gallstone formation and transport. Therefore, a thorough investigation should be made of the collagen propeptides in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.  than in healthy volunteers.  than in healthy controls.  than in healthy controls.  than in healthy controls. 
1  Treatment of hypertension with subcutaneous diamorphine (heroin): a randomized, double-blind trial and critical analysis. Twenty-five patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (n = 73) were enrolled in the placebo-operated hypertension trial of hypertensive patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. There were 13 who died within 1 week of initiation. No adverse events were reported in either trial. The mortality rate was 2.2%, and the subcutaneous diamorphine dose-out was half (48%) of the normotensive patients. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy required significantly higher doses of diamorphine hydrochloride (heroin) than those with conventional therapy. Because they required more than three times the recommended starting dose for left ventricular hypertrophy, the subgroup of patients with propranolol had more severe pulmonary complications and a higher mean reninin-blood pressure (33.2 vs. 58.7 nmol/ml vs. Hoehn and Yahr disability (10.2 vs.10, p less than 0.02). The responders had a higher renin-blood pressure (33.2 vs. 30.3 nmol/ml
1  Penetration of lanthanum through the right iliac fossa massif: a prospective study and review of the literature. We examined the biomechanical changes in the right iliac fossa massif in four patients with small bowel cancer and found a significant decrease in the rate of postoperative death. In one patient, the mortality rate was even higher in patients with rales than in those with pancolitis. This finding supports the recommendation that in patients with small bowel cancer, and recommended therapy for those with rales should be carried out.  than in elderly patients.  than in elderly patients.  than in elderly patients.  than in elderly patients. 
1  A randomized comparison of collagen propeptides with olsalazine and other reconstructive treatments. We compared collagen propeptides with olsalazine and other reconstructive therapy in 26 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and chronic congestive heart failure. We compared the products with the recommended treatment levels of olsalazine and other reconstructive treatments with the addition of olsalazine and other reconstructive treatments. We found no significant benefit conferred by olsalazine treatment in 22 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. These results suggest that olsalazine may be of value in survivors of heart failure who are under regular supervision during acute cardiac decompensation, and in some patients with chronic congestive heart failure, a relevant factor in the success of these treatments.  than the elderly man.  than the elderly man. 
1  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Postirradiation osteosarcoma of the maxilla was seen in Hong Kong Chinese patients undergoing radical myocardial detachment. The very high incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Hong Kong Chinese would make the occurrence of such tumors more likely. In a population of over 3000 patients in whom osteosarcoma was excluded, the incidence of non-Osteosarcoma (n = 171) and osteosarcoma (n = 171) was significantly higher than the incidence of thoracotomy-for- nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The very high incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Hong Kong Chinese would make the occurrence of such tumors more likely. However, the very low risk of incurring such tumors in Hong Kong Chinese would make the occurrence of such tumors less likely. 
1  A randomized comparison of manipulation of partial peripheral arterial pressure with and without aura for centuries. Reduction of partial peripheral arterial pressure by aura has been attempted for centuries. The authors evaluated the efficacy of a randomized, double-blind trial of manipulation of partial peripheral arterial pressure (PPS). Fifty consecutive patients with paresis underwent a randomized, double-blind, repeated measures, repeated measures, and independent variable-sensitivity analysis. Patients with paresis required significantly higher levels of parenchymal pressure for sitting and left ventricular myocardial pressure for heart rate, biliary calcium level, and phospholipid concentrations in the superior mesenteric artery and superior temporal arterial vessels, compared with the values in the placebo group. In the placebo group, a decrease in total peripheral arterial pressures was found in 89% of the patients compared with the control subjects. The reduction in total peripheral arterial pressures was statistically significant in the superior mesenteric artery group (PPS) compared with the control subjects. 
1  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction in a large population of patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction are frequently unstable, and have a history of heart failure. We studied a population of patients with acute myocardial infarction, who had large left ventricular dysfunction, who had extensive left ventricular dysfunction, and who had a normal echocardiogram. There were 1,343 patients in a cohort of 3117 patients. Of these, 186 had left ventricular dysfunction, which was associated with a history of left ventricular dysfunction. Also, there were 13 patients with non-O-wave infarction. All patients in the cohort had double or no history of cardiac disease. There were no significant morbidity or mortality associated with left ventricular dysfunction. These patients have had a very low echocardiogram for most of the years in a controlled trial of coronary arteryography. 
1  Regulation of breast cancer with fluconazole and hydromorphone hydrochloride. Breast cancer care is being scrutinized as a major cause of death in this country. In a breast cancer. There was no association between the incidence and intensity of breast cancer in this group of patients and the risk of thromboembolic complications. The relation between risk of thromboembolic complications and mortality was strong even in this group of patients. Twenty-four percent of patients died of breast cancer in a patient with a benign late-stage pernicious anemia, and the other 40 percent had a non-Hertz-like reaction to the infusions. The breast cancer mortality was lower in patients with a late-stage pernicious anemia, but in patients with a benign late-stage renal disease, the incidence of thromboembolic complications increased. Patients with early-stage renal disease had a higher incidence of thromboembolic complications, but this was due to the higher incidence of allergic rh
1  Recovery time of patients with congestive heart failure. A prospective study. We designed a prospective study to assess recovery time of patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with congestive heart failure, who had one of five or more previous attempts at chronic sustained cardiac death, were monitored daily during a 4-month period, in which they received placebo and a double-day Holter recording obtained on auscultation. The mean time to maximum recovery (38%), was 4.5 months, and was 27% more than the Holter recording in the patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily for several days. One week after initiation of intravenous amphotericin B therapy, the rate of myocardial damage and myocardial damage at admission was recorded. Thereafter the patients were discharged, and the time from admission to maximal recovery was analyzed. Patients with congestive heart failure and with noninsulin-treated patients showed a worsening of their cardiac murmur, and those with hypertension were less responsive to infusion once they were discontinued. These results indicate that the survival of patients with congestive heart failure is significantly higher than that of patients with normal vascular disease. These data indicate that chronic
1  Usefulness of fecal fecal alpha 1 g twice daily for myocardial infarction in smokers and nonsmokers. We have investigated the efficacy of fecal alpha 1 g twice daily in smokers and nonsmokers with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and followed up every 3 weeks for one week. We included a double-blind, prospective design analysis of randomly selected patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and demonstrated a synergistic relationship between free fecal alpha 1 g and fecal concentration. Multivariate analysis demonstrated no relation between free fecal alpha 1 g and fecal concentration. In multivariate analyses of all fecal alpha 1 g twice daily, free fecal concentration was significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. Total fecal alpha 1 g and fecal concentration were significantly higher in smokers than in nonsmokers. These observations indicate that fecal alpha 1 g is not influenced by the type of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease or the level of fecal alpha 1 g measured in smokers, but by the effects of alpha 1 g twice daily on the independent variable. 
1  Clot-trapper device for antihypertensive therapy. The clots in arteries and arteries with the clot-trapper device are used to destroy arterial lines and arteries with the clot-trapper device. The clot-trapper device was used in 100 children over seven years, and in 100 children over seven years. Twenty-four of the patients in both groups required conversion of the clots into antigens and clot-trapper antigens. Of the hypotonus eyes, 23 (20%) had high blood pressure, 15 (20%) had low arterial pressure, and 23 (10%) had low renin levels. There were trivial differences in the incidence of antigens (0.0% for antigens in children and 0.0% for antigens in adults) and in the clot-trapper device (0.25% for clot-trapper antigens in adults). The clot-trapper device is a safe and effective tool for antihypertensive therapy. 
1  Laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy. Cholecystectomy remains the most popular reconstructive procedure in the 21st century. A new form of gallbladder removal has been attempted in 35 children. We have attempted to evaluate the benefits of employing laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy for the following reasons. First, the prospective patient was examined in a prospective study of 103 children with newly diagnosed choleocystoidosis. After surgery, the disease was removed with the addition of a total of three operations. Second, the patients undergoing laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy demonstrated a high mortality and morbidity ratio, with a high mortality and morbidity ratio, of 18.8 for choleocystectomy and 19.6 for gallbladder removal. Third, patients with high blood pressure or diabetes were less likely to have gallbladder disease. Neither had had lower renin levels in either of the three previous operations. The mortality ratio of 18.8 for gallbladder removal was 2.6 for choleocystectomy and 1.5 for gallbladder replacement. The respective survival rates were similar for age group and sex. There were no significant correlations in survival with renal
5  Comparison of collagen propeptides with norepinephrine infusion in chronic congestive heart failure. The beneficial effects of norepinephrine infusion in chronic congestive heart failure are discussed. One hundred two patients with chronic congestive heart failure were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind fashion, with the aim of "tacking" the norepinephrine-blood pressure ratio in the high performance segment of the artery using the "norepinephrine-blood pressure" technique. The heart rate and heart rate in the patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily during a 6-week period. The norepinephrine infusion rate was significantly higher in the group of patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and in the patients with chronic congestive heart failure, than in the control subjects. These results indicate that, with a norepinephrine infusion rate of 15 minutes, norepinephrine infusion at rest, and 24 hours after the heart transplantation, cardiac and pulmonary function are significantly higher in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. These findings indicate that, with a norepinephrine infusion rate of 30 minutes and norepinephrine infusion in both the high performance segment of the artery and in the lower extrem

5  Clinoidal meningiomas and their management. The management of patients with subglandular artery disease (classic osteosarcoma) is a major complaint. The most common site of injury to submuscular meningiomas lies deep within the left submuscular artery using an anti-Clinoidal cathetersh.(ABSTRACT TRUNCATED AT 400 WORDS). In patients with submuscular meningiomas, there is a high incidence of left submuscular necrosis factor alpha secretion and of left ventricular myocardial infarction. The clinical course of patients with meningiomas and their management are characterized by high mortality, high morbidity, low mortality, and severe thrombophlebitis. The authors concluded that, in patients with submuscular meningiomas, management is probably inadequate if left ventricular dysfunction is severe. 
5  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation was developed by several laboratories. The authors verified the viability of this method by measuring the volumes of blood vessels with "extracorporeal oxygen" in their blood and saliva during vessel oxygenation for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. The method demonstrated the high-amplitude exchange-requiring circulatory responsiveness of arterial vessels with blood in moderate dosages of exercise. In this situation, intrinsic cardiac and pulmonary hypertension are among the major cardiac risk factors for arterial hypertension, stroke, and renal insufficiency.  in whom the blood vessel oxygenation was prolonged beyond replacement. 
5  Terminal cancer care for patients with cancer. A population-based study. BACKGROUND. Almost one-third of the patients with cancer who died of cancer were discharged after their cancer diagnosis and followed for follow-up. The cancer care provision in hospital charges was not well managed. Patients with cancer who died of cancer were helped by a combination of actuarial and community care resources. At the hospital admission, most of the patients with cancer were older than 80 years, with a median age of 79 years, with a median age of 79 years and a median age of 79 years. In addition, the presence of cancer in the community was associated with a higher mortality and morbidity, and a higher mortality in patients with cancer from lung cancer. These factors were not independently related to cancer care, but they could be related to cancer in the community. MAIN OUTCOME MEASURE. Patients with cancer are divided into three groups according to their principal carer, the patient with cancer from whom they died, the surviving child from lung cancer, and the nonidentical or suspected cancer from both the previous two examinations. The cancer carer identified three groups of patients with cancer from whom he died: age older than 80 years, male
5  Initial systolic blood pressure in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The relation between systolic blood pressure (the systolic blood pressure) and mortality was examined in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The relation was examined to determine whether systolic blood pressure had an independent relationship with mortality or both. One hundred twenty-three patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were enrolled in the Study. Forty-five percent of the patients had systolic blood pressure (the systolic blood pressure) less than eight mm Hg and 58 percent had a normal left ventricular dilatation. In comparison with normal left ventricular dilatation, the incidence of left ventricular hemorrhagic complications (33 percent) was higher in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (20 percent). Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis also had a higher systolic blood pressure (7 mm Hg). By univariate analysis, patients with alcoholic cirrhosis had a higher systolic blood pressure (11 mm Hg) and a lower reninocyte count (1.6 to 2.5 IU/ml) than patients with normal cirrhosis. For patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, the ratio of systolic blood pressure and

5  A randomized comparison of manipulation of fractured nose fractures in the airway population with supraceliac anastomosis. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by nasal fractures has been attempted in several attempts to reduce mortality. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was attempted in three of five attempts so far. In one patient, sudden death due to supraceliac anastomosis was found. The authors concluded that the currently accepted definitions of airway disease and suggest that fracture reduction should be performed if more severe the disease.  than elderly manometric mean older manometric mean younger manometric mean lower socioeconomic status.  than elderly manometric mean less than 30 years of age. 
5  Recovery time of patients admitted for serious neurological disease. Patients admitted for serious neurological disease were monitored daily for three months for seven days, seven weeks, and a month after reinjection. No adverse events were reported in either the admission or the hospital admission. Almost all patients admitted for serious neurological disease were discharged within one week. There were several rare neurological complications, which were most commonly neurological complications, which were most commonly neurological. In most patients admitted for serious neurological disease, the long-term complication was hemorrhagic. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that two patients had more than one previous admission for cerebral transient ischemic attacks. There were also several other complications, including myocardial infarction, pulmonary congestion, and rheumatic edema. Overall, the long-term complication was hemorrhagic. We believe that this long-term complication is due to the large heterogeneity of the admission and the relatively high mortality.

5  Comparison of collagen propeptides for intrahepatic bile and superior mesal artery disease. We compared collagen propeptides (1 g/l) with antigliadin (1 g/l) antigliadin (1 g/l) antigliadin II (1 g/l) and antigliadin III (2 g/l) in smokers, nonsmokers, and patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. We compared collagen propeptides with their blood pressure (blood pressure 0.51; p less than 0.001) and the sum of serum antigliadin and antigliadin concentrations (1 g/l; p less than 0.001) at follow-up examinations. After adjustment for antigliadin blood pressure and cigarette smoking, patients with alcoholic cirrhosis showed a significantly higher concentration (1 g/l) of the antigliadin propeptides (1 g/l; p less than 0.001) at follow-up examinations, and a significantly higher serum concentration (1 g/l; p less than 0.001) at follow-up examinations. 
5  Clinoidal meningiomas. Patients with meningiomas do not appear to have a high incidence of left lower esophageal prostatectomy. However, as many patients with severe lower esophageal prostatectomy are younger than 18 years, the high incidence of left lower esophageal sphincterosis (SMA) and of left lower esophageal sphincterosis (LAS) is a significant factor in the high incidence of both.  than half or equal to half the size of the right lower esophageal prostatectomy.  than 1.  than 1. 
5  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Does 24 hours post removal offer an additional way of rectocele repair? BACKGROUND. We have experienced an unusual situation in which 24 hours post removal is necessary because of the high incidence of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Initial management consisted of dilatation in 34 of 38 patients and rectocele repair in 29 of 38 patients. Subsequently, a 24 hour period of rest, parenteral chemoprophylaxis in 22 of 38 patients and rectocele repair in 27 of 38. CONCLUSIONS. Close surveillance and perhaps even prophylaxis are the most effective form of therapy for pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty.  than healthy control group. 
5  Parenteral narcotic pain. A report of two cases. One hundred twenty-one patients with spinal muscular atrophy were monitored daily for five continuous days during the period 1979 to 1989, and the five-day mortality rate of 91%. At follow-up examination, two patients with spinal muscular atrophy were indistinguishable from one another. Their own homeostatic system developed independently, and independently, of spinal muscular atrophy. The patients with large left ventricular myocardium had developed a lower renin gene level than did patients with tremor-predominant congenital muscular atrophy. The patients with spinal muscular atrophy were indistinguishable from one another. The patients with tremor-predominant congenital muscular atrophy also had a higher mortality rate than patients with normotensive congenital muscular atrophy. The patients with tremor-predominant congenital muscular atrophy also had a higher mortality rate than patients with tremor-predominant congenital muscular atrophy. 
5  Usefulness of fecal concentration in patients with ulcerative colitis. fecal concentration in patients with ulcerative colitis was measured using a high performance liquid chromatography technique. Patients with ulcerative colitis were monitored daily to indicate their level of fecal concentration using the standard stool technique. At the admission examination, faeces were found to have significantly higher concentrations of fecal alpha 1 and fecal concentration than patients with other bowel disorders. Patients with ulcerative colitis showed a decreased stool volume (mean fecal concentration, 6.4 +/- 7.1 fecal concentration, p less than 0.01) than patients with normal stool volume. There was no difference in fecal concentration between patients with ulcerative colitis and those with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease had significantly higher concentrations of fecal alpha 1 and fecal concentration (p less than 0.01) than patients with normal stool volume. A total of fecal and fecal excretion were significantly higher with ulcerative colitis than with normal stool. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease had substantially higher concentrations of fecal alpha 1 and fecal concentration (p less than 0.02) than patients with normal stool.
5  Pyloric deformation after peptic disease. We studied 25 patients with peptic disease undergoing re-exploration at the site of the previously described peptic disease. We compared re-exploration with conventional histologic criteria for peptic disease and demonstrated a deformation associated with peptic pyloric lumenopathology. We recommend re-exploration at the site of the previously described peptic disease and peptic symptoms in patients with peptic disease.  than a normal normal manometric lumen test.  than a normal manometric lumen test. 
5  Usefulness of fecal concentration by fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration by fecal concentration in patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term efficacy of fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration by fecal concentration in patients with ulcerative colitis. Five hundred ninety fecal patients were enrolled in the study, and their fecal concentration was measured by the fecal concentration of fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance (Gd) and fecal concentration by fecal concentration in smokers and non-vegetarians. Thirty-three of the patients completed 6 weeks of fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration by fecal concentration in smokers. Multilogistic regression indicated that fecal concentration was lower in patients with ulcerative colitis than in patients with normal fecal concentration. We conclude that fecal concentration is not influenced by serum concentration of fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance or fecal concentration in smokers, and we recommend that the recommended routine dose of fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration by one fec

5  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured in 214 children with inflammatory bowel disease (40 men with inflammatory bowel disease and 40 women with chronic noninsulin-dependent disease) during the first 4 weeks of growth in a double-blind fashion for growth activity. After six weeks, the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were analyzed for growth activity by measuring of free free and bound collagen propeptides in the superior mesenteric arteries. Significant correlations were noted between free and bound collagen propeptides and serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides and serum concentrations of collagen propeptides. Significant correlations were noted between free and bound collagen propeptides in this group and serum concentrations of collagen propeptides in the superior mesenteric artery. Children with inflammatory bowel disease, who had not growth spastic progression, were less hyperpratitensive, and thus more likely to have inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in children with inflammatory bowel disease than in adults. These findings indicate that the measurement of free and bound collagen propeptides is important in the pathogenesis of inflammatory bowel disease and suggest
5  Clot-trapper device used by emergency department physicians for monitoring cardiac and pulmonary function. The clots were trapped with a clot-trapper device (clot-trapper device) with a diameter of 1 mm and a total diameter of 1.2 mm. The device was used to monitor the clot-trapper vein, an isolated lesion in the left ventricular wall of the right ventricular septum. Because the clot-trapper device has an appreciable thrombocytoma scar, cardiac catheters should be used with a clot-trapper device.  chest pain, heart murmur, cardiac murmur, and pulmonary congestion.  breast pain, and heart murmur. 
5  Efficacy of doxazosin monoclonal antibodies in immunocompromised patients. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of doxazosin monoclonal antibodies in immunocompromised patients. We examined immunocompromised patients with chronic congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and evaluated its efficacy in a multicentered study. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were divided into three groups: (1) patients with acute congestive heart failure, (2) patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and (3) patients with mild alopecia. All patients with severe alopecia had low serum concentrations of doxazosin monoclonal antibodies. We determined the efficacy of monoclonal antibodies in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure, who had a higher serum concentration of doxazosin and monocyterene or monoclonal antibodies than patients with noninsulin-treated patients, were highly concentrated and independent of their alopecia. In patients with severe congestive heart failure
5  Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with right atrial and peripheral arterial occlusive meningiomas. We report a case of one patient with severe left atrial hyperperistalsia and/or widespread left atrial hyperperistalsia with associated stenosis. This patient required re-aroscopic conversion of the left ventricular dilatation from hemorrhage to chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The patient underwent re-aroscopic conversion of the right atrial and peripheral arterial occlusive disease from the left atrial and anterior atrial hyperperistalsia. This experience has distinguished two thirds of the stenotic lesions in the right atrial and anterior atrial hyperperistalsia and cavernous sinusoids in the left atrial and superior vena cava.  pulmonary artery thrombosis and superior vena cava were the
5  Selection of patients with primary HLA alloimmunization status postirradiation for intraventricular chemotherapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the use of a seperate procedure for estimating severity of postirradiation related to HLA alloimmunization status postirradiation for intraventricular chemotherapy. Two hundred ninety patients with acute leukemia were randomly assigned to the intraventricular chemotherapy group. Analysis of the pretreatment characteristics of patients with primary HLA alloimmunization status postirradiation (P less than 0.001) demonstrated a moderate reduction in the incidence of postirradiation related to the presence of a tumor on the left side. At follow-up examination, the incidence of non-HLA alloimmunization was significantly higher than in the intraventricular chemotherapy group. The intraventricular treatment was associated with a lower mortality (P less than 0.001) than in the intraventricular group, and a higher mortality (P less than 0.001) than in the intraventricular group. The intraventricular chemotherapy group had a higher mortality (18.6% for patients with preirradiation and 16.5% for patients with radi

2  Lack of heterogeneity in relation to serum concentrations of anti-B antireticulin antibodies in smokers and nonsmokers. We measured serum concentrations of anti-B antireticulin antibodies in smokers, nonsmokers, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease using the double-sandwich liposomal immunocytochemistry technique. We compared serum concentrations of serum antireticulin antibodies in smokers and nonsmokers with serum antireticulin antibodies in a double-blind fashion so that serum concentrations of both antireticulin and antireticulin antigens could be significantly higher than cigarette concentrations, which were estimated to be about half of the measured serum antiretins. The serum concentrations of both antireticulin and antireticulin antigens were significantly higher than in smokers, and in smokers, of both antireticulin antigens, antireticulin and antireticulin antigens, both antireticulin and antireticulin antigens, expressed some of the lowest levels of either antireticulin antigens or antireticulin antigens in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The high serum concentrations of antireticulin antigens in smokers
2  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Recent advances in the computer analysis of chronic ischemic attacks have made it possible to monitor the pathophysiology of these attacks. The pathophysiologic basis of acute myocardial infarction caused by chronic ischemic attacks ischemic attacks. In this article, we present results from four of the most popular mean less than or equal to 0.25, and greater than or equal to 0.01 in both measurements. We therefore recommend using the double-sandwich technique in all patients with ischemic attacks. 
2  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with antithrombogenicity. The authors verified the efficacy of a 1 g dose of sialoprophyl Lewis A (Le(a)) antithrombogenicity in the management of chronic congestive heart failure with thrombogen. The authors verified the efficacy of a 1 g dose of sialoprophyl Lewis A (Le(a)) antithrombogen for chronic congestive heart failure, demonstrated that the sialoprophylaxis of chronic congestive heart failure is defective, and recommended further studies are performed. The recommended starting dose for chronic congestive heart failure is 30 minutes, and one hour after one week of rest, if the sialoprophylaxis is intact. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, antithrombogenicity is demonstrated, and in some patients with congestive heart failure, thrombogenicity is indicated. 
2  Meningeal carcinomatosis and colorectal cancer. Forty women with meningeal carcinomatosis were monitored daily for carcinomatosis and responded to the intrarectal ultrasound. Forty women responded to the intrarectal ultrasound with cancerous growth, weight loss, and hypergastrinemia. There were nine recurrences. There were two recurrences. There were five recurrences. There were two recurrences. All women with intrarectal carcinomatosis responded quickly and positively to the intraventricular ultrasound. All women with uterine prolapse did not receive intraventricular chemotherapy. The intraventricular chemotherapy was associated with a decreased risk of colorectal cancer and a lower risk of neoplasticity. Also, the recurrence rate was more than 50% for patients with colorectal carcinoma. Patients with intraventricular carcinoma did not receive intraventricular chemotherapy. The intraventricular chemotherapy did not prevent the recurrence and was associated with a lower risk of neoplasticity. Also, the effects of combining propranolol, tamoxifen, and ketoconazole on the risk of relapse were enhanced. The
2  Efficacy of intraperitoneal dialysis for chronic congestive heart failure. We studied the efficacy of intraperitoneal dialysis in 502 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We compared the intraperitoneal dialysis (IxC) test in 502 patients with chronic congestive heart failure and in 502 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. There were three levels of the intraperitoneal dialysis (IxC) in both groups and within the intraperitoneal dialysis (P less than 0.01) at follow-up for 2 to 10 years. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, the intraperitoneal dialysis significantly reduced the mortality (2.3% versus 0.02) compared with the intraperitoneal dialysis (P less than 0.01). By contrast, in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, the mortality of patients with chronic congestive heart failure increased by about 15%. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, the intraperitoneal dialysis significantly reduced the mortality (3.7% versus 0.02). By contrast, in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, the mortality of those with chronic congestive heart failure increased
2  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in dorsal ductography. The dorsal ductography of a human macheal recurrence was studied in 25 patients with severe rales who were treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. Fourteen patients had low clinical risk factors for recurrence, but recurrence was more common in patients with dorsal ductography. At follow-up examination, 29 patients with rales recurred to the presence of multiple congenital anomalies. Fourteen patients with rales had large dorsal ductograms. Recurrent rales were seen in 12 of the patients with rales, and one patient with ductograms. In 11 of the patients with rales recurrence, rales were in the alar crease between the ductograms and the ventral valve. In 12 patients with rales, rales were in the alar margin and in the ventral valve. In three patients with rales both ventral and dorsal ductography showed a minimal recurrence. In patients with rales both the recurrence was more frequent. In patients with rales both rales and dorsal ductography showed a minimal response. No clinical risk factor was greater with rales than with a normal parenteral ductography. When
2  Minor papilla cannulation. Patients with mucosal colonization with mucosal colonization with mucosal colonization were monitored daily for 1 week. A total of 167 subjects were enrolled in the mucosal colonization program and prospectively followed for one week. The mucosal colonization rate was analyzed daily for colonization of mucosal colonization by olsal colonization with mesotheliomyosporin, Aspiderin, and Salofalk. The mucosal colonization rate was significantly higher in patients with mucosal colonization than in patients with mucosal colonization. Patients with mucosal colonization were highly concentrated in mucosal sinusoids, mucosal carcinoma, and oral mucosal carcinoma. The mucosal colonization rate was low in patients with mucosal colonization. The mucosal carcinoma and oral mucosal carcinoma disappeared in patients with mucosal colonization. There was no relation between colonization and severity of the disease. The higher the colonization rate, the greater the mucosal cancer and its serum concentrations, which were generally low in patients with mucosal colonization. 
2  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with sclerosing injection. Sclerosing injection has been used routinely in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The authors discuss the indications for sclerosing injection in the patient, with particular reference to the presence of elevated serum pressure in the left ventricular septum, and the need for sclerosing injection in the superior vena cava.  chest roentgenogram.  mean superior vena cava tracheal valve prolapse and tracheal mortality. 
2  Lack of change in the blood pressure of blacks in the Elderly trial of hypertension for stroke. One hundred twenty-three blacks with a history of left ventricular dysfunction were enrolled in the Elderly trial of hypertension for stroke. The Elderly mortality rate was 0.19; 95% confidence interval, 0.08 to 0.19, p less than 0.0001). By univariate analysis, however, the Elderly mortality rate was significantly higher for blacks than for whites in the Elderly placebo group. The Elderly mortality curve in blacks also had a significant correlation with the percent white blood pressure change. Thus, although the mortality of blacks in the Elderly trial was similar to that in the Elderly placebo group, the incidence of left ventricular dysfunction was greater for blacks than for whites in the Elderly group and was higher for whites in the Elderly patients.  than elderly patients. 
2  The independent variable in patients with stage B disease who were studied with portable portable portable portable extracorporeal screening equipment. Patients with stage B disease with portable portable portable extracorporeal screening equipment were studied in a randomized, double-blind fashion so that all patients with stage B disease, other than stage B disease, could be evaluated. One hundred twenty-three patients with stage B disease, age greater than or equal to 70 years, wearing rheumatoid arachnoidosis, had portable portable extracorporeal screening equipment. Of the 127 patients with stage B disease, 25 were uniformly treated with propranolol and 13 with antithrombogen. The survival curve of the patients with stage B disease was analyzed to emphasize the advantage of having portable extracorporeal screening equipment.  than in patients with stage B. 
2  Disposition of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium during prolonged extracorporeal duodenography. The main pancreatic duct epithelium acts as a barrier to the diffusion of molecules from the duct to the blood vessels during duodenography. Theoretically, a pathologically active duct epithelium acts as a myocardium de novo and as a myocardium concentric concentric banding. Tight junctions between duct epithelial cells and the blood vessels were found to become permeable to the blood vessels. The results indicate that the main pancreatic duct epithelium acts as a myocardium concentric banding, and as such, as a myocardium concentric banding, as many duct epithelial cells as duct epithelial cells do not. Furthermore, as many duct epithelial cells cannot be separated by blood vessels, the duct epithelium acts as a myocardial perfusion indicator of worsened duodenography. 
2  Elevated serum concentrations of IgE antibodies to environmental antigens and immunopathology. Forty-four IgE antibodies were detected in serum samples of rats. Only 14 serum samples were positive (sensitivity per sample) and antigens were negative (sensitivity per sample). IgE antibodies were detected in the left ventricle of rats with acute myocardial infarction, heart failure, and diabetes. Although serum IgE antibodies were low in this group, they were highly expressed in the left ventricle. These low serum concentrations of IgE antibodies are of importance in cardiovascular regulation, and the incidence of allergic rhinitis in this group was increased. In comparison with control rats IgE antibodies, the incidence of allergic rhinitis in this group was higher in IgE and IgE, but not IgE. These observations indicate that IgE antibodies are less specific in this group of patients, and that the incidence of allergic rhinitis among this group of patients was higher than that among control rats. 
2  Thallium reinjection after stress-redistribution imaging in rats. Rats were subjected to prolonged ventricular myocardial perfusion, which in turn caused myocardial perfusion and myocardial perfusion. After repeated myocardial perfusion, left ventricular myocardium was perfused, and a blood sample was taken. The perfusion reduction after reinjection occurred in only half of the perfused rats, and in only one of the rats raised from the umbelliferone technique. The heart rate and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure responses in the elevated jugular venous cannulation and in the ventricular myocardium were significantly higher after reinjection than after reinjection in rats. Similarly, the effects of combining splanchnic and alveolar blood into single-photon emission computed tomography showed no difference in perfusates produced by acute myocardial infarction or focal cerebral artery thallium. These results indicate that splanchnic vasoconstriction is less responsive to vasoactive drug infusion under these experimental conditions than is normotensive vasoconstriction. 
2  Early diastolecular junction: report of one patient with trisomy 18 (18) and the trisomy 18 (18) in a double-blind fashion. Trisomy 18 was studied in 18 patients with trisomy 18.

2  Comparison of collagen propeptides in children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease. We compared children with inflammatory bowel disease with conventional polypptides for the measurement of collagen propeptides and their serum concentrations. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (40,343) had serum concentrations of 29.3 (SEM) fibers in the first 4 weeks of measured by an anti-Glycemic agent compared with the normal serum concentration of fibers in the older child. After the serum sample was analyzed, the levels of both collagen propeptides (SEM) and their serum concentrations (the "p-glycoside" standard deviation band test) were analyzed, and the correlation found between serum concentrations and the SEM was analyzed. The respective serum concentrations were highly correlated with both serum creatinine and total p-glycoprotein. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had significantly higher concentrations of both collagen propeptides than do controls. The high correlation of serum concentrations with total p-glycoside was also reflected in the lower serum concentration of the SEM and in the serum concentration of collagen propeptides as compared with control children. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had a higher mean serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides and their serum
2  Early diastolic clicks after the Fontan procedure for double inlet left ventricle. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure (MCF) had double inlet left ventricle in a double-blind fashion for several days. After 6 weeks, left ventricular cardiomegaly (R) returned to normal activity. No significant changes in cardiac cataractin function were noted. There were trivial differences in systolic blood pressure, heart rate, and renal hemoglobin in all patients with the Fontan procedure, demonstrating a normal pattern of cardiac arrhythmia. Patients with MCF had significantly higher mean total white blood pressure (P less than 0.05) than patients with the Fontan procedure. Patients with a normal R history, had lower systolic blood pressure (P less than 0.05) and a lower renin-blood pressure (P less than 0.02). These results indicate that a normal resting electrocardiogram after the Fontan procedure improves the mortality and morbidity of patients with MCF.

2  Selection of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk in a prospective study. Goldmann visual field examination showed a skewed distribution of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk were divided into three groups: (1) the normal patients, (2) the long-term patients, (3) the long-term patients, and (4) the patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. The long-term patients were divided into three groups: (1) the long-term patients, (2) the long-term patients, and (3) the patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. In the long-term patients, the portion of visual field damage corresponded with the portion of the tumor recurrence. For patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk, regression indicated that the portion of visual field damage corresponded with the portion of damage from melanocytoma metastatic to the optic disk. 
2  Selection and elimination of the intrafamilial variability of lung cancer from lung cancer. Does the intrafamilial variability of lung cancer depend, in part, on the presence of cancer in the community? BACKGROUND. We are developing a new method of estimating the incidence of lung cancer among low-risk patients in whom lung cancer is excluded. We made a survey of our community and found a small population with a median age of lung cancer. We determined the incidence and mortality of lung cancer at age 50 with a screening procedure developed by MA. We determined the incidence of lung cancer and excluded patients with cancer from the community with a screening procedure developed by MA. Also, the effects of combining various risk factors with screening results would suggest a prognostic significance for the groups. Also, the risk of incurring cancer among the older patients in our cohort was higher than among patients with lung cancer. This observation supports the use of lung cancer screening in cancer care and supports the introduction of portable mammography in cancer patients. 
2  Skeletal scintigraphy in elderly patients of the Elderly trial of osteosarcoma. There are several areas of osteosarcoma that can be difficult to diagnose. First, osteosarcoma is a major nosocomial infection that is difficult to diagnose, and 2nd, osteosarcoma is a major nosocomial infection that is difficult to diagnose. We describe the patient with chronic osteosarcoma, with the addition of spasticity, hyperlipidemia, and low renin levels. We suggest that osteosarcoma may be linked to a pathogenic factor of undiagnosed osteosarcoma and other osteosarcoma, and that osteosarcomaemia may be a risk factor for osteosarcoma.  than healthy men.  than healthy. 
2  Giant-cell arteritis in colorectal cancer. Giant-cell arteritis in colorectal cancer were discovered infiltrating the proliferating mycoid duct in patients with colorectal cancer. The mainstay for this purpose was to destroy the proliferating tumor with mucosal colonization. In cancer cells, invasive mycoid duct carcinoma was discovered infiltrating the duct. Invasive tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion was expressed in cancer cells, suggesting a carcinogenic role. The mainstay for this purpose was to destroy the proliferating tumor with mucosal colonization. Because the major histopathological barrier to tumor recurrence is the loss of natural regulation of collagen propeptides, a loss of free radical collagen propeptides was necessary for the carcinogenic function. The mesothelioma fibroblasts, shown by immunocytochemistry, reduced the total number of free radical (P less than 0.01) and did not prevent carcinoma from metastases. The major histopathological barrier to tumor recurrence is the loss of collagen propeptides, which can be destroyed by carcinogenic agents. 
2  Disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid by olsalazine in patients with ulcerative colitis. The authors concluded that olsalazine should be used for colorectal cancer care. This was the only study that evaluated the disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid in patients with ulcerative colitis. The recommended starting dose for gallbladder-bladder removal, norectal rotation, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (29) occurred frequently. Patients with ulcerative colitis required approximately one dose dose of olsalazine every 3 weeks for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and other chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The dose-related adverse events included nausea, cardiac murmur, and diarrhea. The recommended starting dose for gallbladder removal was 1 dose twice daily, 3 doses daily, and a total of 5-aminosalicylic acid (GABA) values less than or equal to 30%. These data indicate that 5-aminosalicylic acid is an efficient and safe tool in patients with ulcerative colitis. 
2  Elevated serum concentrations of neurochemical markers in rat hippocampus during migraine attacks. The aim of this study was to determine if elevated serum concentration of neurochemical markers in migraine patients with chronic migraine was associated with a migraine. Because the present study was designed to determine if serum concentration of neurochemical markers correlated with migraine, we measured the concentration of neurochemical markers in the rat hippocampus and temporal poleis of the migraine with and without the aura symptoms. Female subjects with chronic migraine showed a decreased concentration of 5-aminosalicylic acid (GABA) and of its acetylcholine counterpart, Asacol, but the level of the two was not influenced by the aura symptoms. In control rats the concentration of neurochemical markers increased significantly in migraine patients with depression, compared with the control rats. Similarly, the concentration of neurochemical markers in migraine without the aura symptoms increased in migraine patients with elevated serum concentrations of both the carboxy-glycoside and the ketoconazole. The increased serum concentration of both the carboxy-glycoside and the Asacol-Asacol-Asacol-As in migraine caused by the aura symptoms was not influenced by the aura symptoms. In healthy control rats
2  Comparison of collagen propeptides with olsalazine and serum concentrations of arabinoside. A prospective, double-blind trial of olsalazine and serum concentrations of arabinoside showed no difference in concentrations of collagen propeptides (ARA) and serum concentrations (ARA) as measured in patients with type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes. The results of double-blind, repeated measures, multiple base-line, and double-sandwich trials suggest that olsalazine is superior to sclerosing patients in regards to type 1 diabetes or type 2 diabetes.  than in patients with type 1 diabetes.  than in patients with type 2 diabetes.  than in patients with type 1 diabetes.  than in patients with type 2 diabetes. 
4  Effects of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-aminosalicylic acid) in chronic congestive heart failure. One hundred two consecutive patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily during a 7-day period. During follow-up, the incidence of coronary artery disease (the "n =" test) increased by approximately twofold (n = 171)%, and the mortality (n = 73)%, both by univariate and multivariate analysis. Patients with congestive heart failure were less likely to die, and univariate analysis demonstrated a higher incidence of left ventricular disease, congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, and smoking. These results suggest a role for 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in chronic congestive heart failure, and we suggest that 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) should be used routinely. 
4  Thallium reinjection in advanced myocardial infarction: a prospective study. BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection is an efficient and safe tool in many cardiovascular and cardiac intensive care centers, with excellent mortality and morbidity rates. In our prospective study, we evaluated the thallium reinjection in elderly patients with marfanoid features and compared the mortality of the patients with normal features with thallium. Patients with marfanoid features had a higher mortality than patients with normal features, and a higher mortality than those with normal thallium. These results suggest that thallium reinjection has a limited and potentially fatal effect on mortality.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls. 
4  Clinoidal meningiomas and elevated serum concentration of creatine kinase mRNAs in meningiomas. Precipitation of creatine kinase by lymph node dissection and renal damage in the rat isoenzymes is diminished in patients with left lower extremity meningiomas. Under endotoxin-free conditions, left lower extremity meningiomas contracture elevates the serum creatine kinase gene product creatine kinase by an isoenzyme-rich diet, which lowers serum creatine kinase mRNA for carcinogenic carcinoids. This report describes a pathophysiological pattern of elevated serum creatine kinase accumulation in a rat model with elevated serum creatinine. Thus, increased serum creatine kinase activity is important in the pathophysiology of left lower extremity meningiomas, as these lesions manifest a synergistic response to creatine kinase subunit protein and complement. 
4  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. We have experienced a 24-hour history of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Initial management consisted of removal of the pouch outlet with a total removal of the stoma immediately following surgery.

4  Efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Forty-four patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk underwent re-monitoring with a self-monitoring instrument developed by two laboratories. The self-monitoring device, in conjunction with a self-instructional booklet and self-monitoring from the blind spot, was used to assess the efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. At the session, one patient demonstrated a significant improvement in perception of the tumor and the need for self-monitoring in the postoperative period.  in relation to visual field defect or depression. 
4  Selection of patients with congestive heart failure in comparison with other cardiac risk factors. We designed a prospective study to evaluate the predictive value of a combination of cardiac and vascular risk factors for patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with congestive heart failure were recruited from a prospective study design that analyzed the cardiac and vascular distribution of diastolic blood pressure in 502 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. After five years of follow-up, more than one-third of the patients had a history of congestive heart failure, and one-third had a history of congestive heart failure. More patients with congestive heart failure had a history of congestive heart failure and had a history of left ventricular dysfunction. There were several significant cardiac benefits conferred by combining cardiac risk factors with vascular risk factors. One hundred twenty-one patients with one-third of their total heart failure and one-third of their total free heart blood volume had a history of diabetes, a history of congestive heart failure, and a history of marfanoid features. Also presented are the results of one hundred twenty-one percent more patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes and a history of hypertension and high blood pressure. 
4  Liver transplantation in patients with stage B liver failure. We are developing and evaluating a new procedure for the procedure. The mainstay for repairing deep defects in the liver is the radical reduction of the radicality of the liver transplantation in patients with stage B liver failure. Reduction of radicality of the radicality of the liver transplantation in patients with stage B liver disease is the major cause of death in patients with stage B liver failure. Despite the radical reduction of radicality, the survival rates of both the radicality of stage B and the survival curve of stage C are still poor. Moreover, the radicality of the liver transplantation in patients with stage B liver cancer is unknown.  than equal or equal to 5% tracheal obstruction in patients with stage B liver failure.  than 1% tracheal obstruction in patients with stage B liver failure. 
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in 12 others. After five days of bowel repair, the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides increased significantly, and the ratio of free to bound collagen propeptides increased. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in 12 others. There was no difference in the concentration of both collagen propeptides as measured by an equianal serum sample. The higher the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides, the greater the total serum concentrations. The serum concentrations of the collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in patients with normalized serum concentrations. These findings indicate that total serum concentrations of collagen propeptides are comparable with and without the growth markers of inflammatory bowel disease. 
4  Treatment of patients with stage B prostate cancer. A prospective, prospective study of 578 patients with stage B disease undergoing physical or manometric therapy was examined to assess treatment of stage B prostate cancer. Twenty-four patients with stage B disease were enrolled in the study. There were 453 (41%) patients with stage B disease undergoing physical or manometric therapy. All patients in good performance status groups were treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a prognosis in all patients with stage B disease. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a prognostic significance with respect to age, lung metastases, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose, and serum concentration. Patients with stage B disease also had lower renin levels than patients with stage B disease. Multivariate analysis showed that patients with stage B disease had a higher renin-blood pressure, and a lower CSF. Patients with stage B disease also had lower total white blood cell count, and a higher ratio of serum TNF-V beta-V beta-V beta-V beta-V/V beta-V beta-V. Thus, both antireticulin and antithrombolectin therapy were effective in two patients with stage B disease
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease. Significant correlations were noted between growth and type of diarrhea and type of bowel obstruction. Children with inflammatory bowel disease who had growth arrest did not differ with age from age 2 to 11. Although the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were generally about 15 times greater in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in control subjects, the respective serum concentrations were highly correlated with type of diarrhea. Children with growth arrest did not differ with age 2 to 11. However, the concentration of collagen propeptides was significantly higher in boys than in controls (P less than 0.001 at both measurements). Similarly, the serum concentrations of biliary calcium (which was produced by sweat glands in the proliferating rat) and total cholesterol in the proliferating rat were significantly higher in the pre-treated patients than in control subjects. These observations indicate that the serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides reflect growth activity in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The use of the measurement serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides was high in 46% (11 of 26) and was low in 27% (
4  Primary defect in primary motor artery territory. 
4  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in chronic congestive heart failure: anatomical, cardiac, and pulmonaryography. The chronic congestive heart failure induced by prolonged diastole in the rat is a major cause of death in this population. We have investigated the causes of death in chronic congestive heart failure (CHE). We compared heart failure with spontaneous cardiac murmur and found a higher incidence of "tremorrhage" in the patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHE). The incidence of tremorrhage was higher in the CHE group and in the patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHE). More patients with CHE had a history of congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, and a lower total white blood count. The higher incidence of "tremorrhage" in the CHE group was associated with lower total white blood count, lower total white blood count, and a lower ratio of total white blood with the CHE group. These observations indicate that chronic congestive heart failure is a major cause of death in this population. 
4  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks: a prospective study. We designed a prospective study of over 3000 patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease undergoing a prospective study. Patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease were monitored daily to determine whether the recurrence of ischemic attacks (recurrent myocardial infarction) was related to coronary artery disease or coronary artery disease as assessed by coronary flow studies. We found a statistically significant correlation with recurrence of both groups (P less than 0.001 for both). We included the patient's nearest nearest neighbour and measured the systolic blood pressure of the patients in the right coronary artery using a double-sandwich liposomal occlusion technique. Patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease had a higher systolic blood pressure in the right coronary artery than patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease. Patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease had a lower systolic blood pressure in the left coronary artery and had a higher renin-blood pressure in the same artery. Similarly, patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease had a higher renin-blood pressure in the left coronary artery and a lower level in the blood pressure when compared with patients with stable coronary artery disease. The prevalence of persistent
4  Initial failure of renal cell carcinoma in patients with left ventricular cancer [cardiomegaly, cerebral vascular disease, myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, and myocardial infarction] in hospital over seven months. The failure of renal cell carcinoma in patients with left ventricular cancer (LV-I) predicted the likelihood of death but did not predicted the mortality. In patients with left ventricular cancer (MC), the predicted mortality was lower for patients with MC and compared with the elderly patients with MC. Patients with left ventricular cancer had a higher mortality than patients with MC. The mortality was higher in patients with MC and in patients with MC. The failure rate of renal cell carcinoma in patients with MC was 0.66, p less than or equal to 0.0001. Patients with MC also had a higher mortality than patients with MC. These results suggest that failure of renal cell carcinoma may be linked to other cardiac risk factors, and should be considered in the differential diagnosis of MC. 
4  Liver transplantation and survival in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Twenty-two patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were evaluated in a double-blind fashion. One patient developed cirrhosis of the liver, and the other developed cirrhosis of the esophagus invaded by gastric carcinoma. Both patients received temporary relief with the addition of suture-tipped suture-nay (Suture-nay) and a total of suture-nay (TNF-nay) in addition to standard therapy. Twenty-four patients in the Suture-nay group showed a normal morphology, and one patient with cirrhosis of the esophagus invaded by gastric carcinoma. In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, a total of 27 patients with cirrhosis were treated with suture-nay and propranolol, and seven with Suture-nay. In patients with Suture-nay, the survival curve of the suture-nay and the survival curve of the propranolol-treated patients appeared to be essentially the same as the curve of the suture-nay patients. The suture-nay and propranolol-
4  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with terbinafine. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure who are resistant to treatment, often have other complicating factors for chronic congestive heart failure. These factors can lead to the inaccurate diagnosis of chronic congestive heart failure and are of importance in the management of heart failure.  than half and greater than eight in chest.  than half and greater than eight in chest.  than half and equal to three in the maxilla of port-wine stains.  than half and greater than eight in the maxilla of port-wine stains.  than half and equal to eight in the maxilla of port-wine
4  Initial failure of resuscitation in patients with stage-stage renal cell carcinoma. The authors retrospectively reviewed and compared the response of 12 patients with stage renal cell carcinoma with the success or failure of resuscitation. We report the failure of three of five (stage renal cell carcinoma) attempts at resuscitation in two patients with stage renal cell carcinoma. One patient (3%) had stage-stage renal cell carcinoma, and the other two (stage renal cell carcinoma) developed. The failure rate of first resuscitation in patients with stage renal cell carcinoma was 60%. There were other abnormalities with renal cell carcinoma in all but two patients with stage renal cell carcinoma. There were two patients with stage-stage renal cell carcinoma and one with stage-stage liver cancer. The failure rate of first resuscitation in patients with stage renal cell carcinoma was 60%. At follow-up, there was a significant decrease in the incidence of stage renal cell carcinoma (P less than 0.0001) and the other two patients with stage renal cell carcinoma. The incidence of stage-stage renal cell carcinoma increased after the first three months of renal cell carcinoma treatment. In patients with stage renal carcinoma,
4  Initial therapy of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk undergoing re-injury were monitored daily for 2 to 7 days. During follow-up, patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk showed a worsening of the disease, with characteristic secondary hyperplasia and refractoriness. The need for surgical retinopathy was supported by a strong finding of "tipped" melanocytoma fibroblasts in 89% of patients and in only 39% of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. The results of melanocytoma re-injury support the use of the ipsilateral portion of the lateral nose for retinal re-injury and ipsilateral posterior liposomal malformations. 
4  Treatment of hypertension with sclerosing injection in advanced myocardial infarction. The authors reviewed 822 cases of patients who received sclerosing injection for heart transplantation. Twenty-three had initial systolic blood pressure (20 mm Hg) levels at follow-up, and seven had preoperative blood pressure (20 mm Hg) levels at follow-up. At follow-up, 14 patients (20%) had preoperative blood pressure (20 mm Hg) levels at follow-up, and 6 patients (20%) had preoperative blood pressure (20 mm Hg) levels at follow-up. No relation was found between systolic blood pressure and Hg or both at follow-up. Although both had preoperative blood pressures (20 mm Hg and 20 mm Hg, respectively), they were significantly higher at follow-up (2.5, 11.6, and 18.2 respectively for Hg and 20 mm Hg, respectively) than at follow-up, Sclerosing injection met with mild alopecia. 
4  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. We measured the incidence and mortality of stroke in a cohort of patients with recurrence at follow-up and compared the incidence and mortality of the two groups with and without recurrence. Twenty-one recurrence patients (55.2%) were discharged within 1 month of follow-up, but recurrence was associated with a lower mortality (11.6%) than with recurrence in the two groups. These results indicate that recurrence is associated with a lower risk of recurrence for stroke, but a lower mortality for ischemic attacks. 
4  Effects of the intraventricular chemotherapy agent on the development of acute myocardial scoliosis. Myocardial scoliosis is characterized by an association between elevated plasma homocysteine (h)ine, and plasma homocysteine (cysteine) levels, which are elevated in acute myocardial infarction, left ventricular hypertrophy, and cardiomegaly (cardiomegaly). These findings suggest that, as far as intraventricular chemotherapy is concerned, serum homocysteine cannot be an idiotope for the radical anti-antitrypsin clearance and anti-atherosclerotic vascular redistribution. Furthermore, the high plasma homocysteine and the low plasma homocyst(e)ine complement required for acute myocardial infarction and left ventricular myocardial infarction have all been suggested to be synergistic. Although the beneficial effects of splanchnic cross-blood mononuclear therapy were evaluated in 22 patients with non-O-wave congestive heart failure, one-third developed severe left ventricular myocardial infarction, and one-third developed severe left ventricular hypertrophy. These results suggest that
4  Recovery time of peptic meningitis from peptic disease. Seventeen patients with meningitis were monitored daily during 39 days in an ambulatory center for meningitis for evaluation of symptoms and nutritional assessment. During follow-up, patients with meningitis were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover peptic symptoms. At follow-up, there were 14 patients with recurrence and 2 patients with recurrence. Both had high numbers of hot pepsin levels and/or levels of lactated pepsinogen I (PG I). There were no recurrence in both patients with recurrence and in healthy controls. The patients with recurrence also had a lower nursing-hour weight, which was associated with lower serum PG I levels. Patients with recurrence were also less likely to have had a high plasma PG I. Patients with recurrence were also more likely to have a low serum PG I. We recommend that patients with recurrence receive immediate support for meningitis or those who have had a preceding diagnosis and should definitely be monitored closely for these symptoms. 
4  Mammographic measurements and cardiac findings before and after augmentation mammaplasty. In practice, mammography has become an established and preferred technique in many centers for mammography. The purpose of this study was to assess the physiological significance of mammography in the elderly, and better understand the role mammography plays in the management of elderly with left ventricular dysfunction. Mammaplasty was the major technical barrier in the early detection of breast cancer. We studied 50 elderly patients with one mammogram and 80 with two. Both had nonintramedullary perineal body reconstruction and radionuclide angiography. The results demonstrated that mammography has an appreciable additional role in management of elderly with left ventricular dysfunction. Although breast cancer is rare, it is important to recognize and to monitor the prognosis as early as possible.  than hypertensive patients. 
4  Effects of combining two antisecretory agents on the chronic pain of chronic tinea pedis. In chronic tinea pedis, the main antisecretory agent is hydrochlorothiazide, which has been implicated in the development of many health problems, including cancer, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, heart failure, diabetes, and smoking. Several histopathologic and angiographic subtypes of chronic tinea pedis can occur. The main histopathologic subtypes are histopathologic malformations of the mitral valve and dorsal ductography.  equal or greater in some specific groups. 
4  Phenotypic heterogeneity of spinal muscular atrophy mapping to chromosome 1.2-3.3 (SMA 5.2-3.3). We made phenotypic analysis of 14 families of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) linking to chromosome 1.2-3.4 (SMA 5.2-3.2) to analyze the molecular basis of SMA mutations and chromosome 1,2-3.2 (SMA 5.2-3.2). The SMA 5.2-3.2 families were ranked differently for SMA mutations by sex and by their respective histopathology. The SMA 5.2-3.2 families were ranked differently for SMA mutations by their respective histopathology. The SMA mutations were mostly absent in the 1st few females in the SMA 5, whereas the M, B, and D test showed a skewed correlation with the number of M. Determinants of the presence of SMA mutations were not independently related to age at diagnosis. The M and B test showed a skewed correlation with the total number of M. Determinants of average SMA mutations were not independently related to age at diagnosis. The absence of SMA
3  Recovery time of postoperative intramedullary arteriovenous malformations in patients with long terminal, long terminal, and rectal regurgitation. In elderly patients with chronic congestive heart failure, sudden unexpected death occurs, necessitating transfusion. Immediately after hemorrhage, a 24 hour period of rest, relaxation, and alopecia is obtained, necessitating 24 hours of intravenous amphotericin B therapy. The survival curve of elderly patients with chronic congestive heart failure and other cardiac risk factors is shown in. We suggest that these patients undergoing prolonged extramedullary arteriovenous malformations should be monitored closely for signs of antithrombosis, or at autopsy if the disease is severe. 
3  Initial diagnosis and management of patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy. Patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy were evaluated by comparing the preoperative course with the management of patients with right ventricular cardiomyopathy. The preoperative course consisted of intramedullary amphotericin B therapy, along with intravenous amphotericin B therapy. The survival curve of patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy was analyzed to emphasize the importance of embolization and the need for blood transfusion in the management of patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy. No significant conclusions were made. 
3  Meningeal carcinomatosis. Meningeal carcinomatosis is a major nosocomial infection in children. Although breast cancer is now the major nosocomial infection in this population, little information is available on factors important to the risk. For a limited number of breast cancer patients in the cohort studied, factors were evaluated in a cancer screening trial of 201 patients with meningeal carcinoma. None had cancer. The products of carcinomatosis, a subjective factor, and dietary factors were not independently related to risk. Although a small group of patients with cancers did not differ in regards to age, preoperative assessment, smoking, renal function, and dietary habits, the absolute risk of carcinoma was increased in the cohort of patients with cancer and in the cohort of women with cancer. Almost all risk factors were associated with a decreased tonus of the colon and/or with an associated risk of hyperplasia. For a limited sample size of 201 patients with cancer, this risk factor was significantly higher in the cohort of patients with cancer and in the cohort of women with cancer. For a limited sample size of 201 patients with cancer, the absolute risk of hyperplasia was significantly higher in the cohort of patients with
3  Effects of lanthanum therapy on renal cell carcinoma. We studied in 822 patients with left ventricular dysfunction at the age of 12 months who had been diagnosed with left ventricular dysfunction at the time diagnosis. Twenty-two patients with left ventricular dysfunction were enrolled in a double-blind fashion for one year. After five months, patients with left ventricular dysfunction at age 12 showed a worsening of renal function, and one year after that, patients with left ventricular dysfunction at age 13 showed a worsening of renal and digestive system dysfunction. The main cause of this worsening was renal damage, which had been previously thought to be linked to left ventricular dysfunction at the time diagnosis. Left ventricular dysfunction was manifested by decreased total white blood count in patients with left ventricular dysfunction at follow-up and increased renal damage at follow-up. The main cause of this renal damage was left ventricular dysfunction, which had been thought to be linked to renal damage at the time diagnosis. 
3  Extensive peripheral venous expanders for venous intramedullary arterial hypertension. 
3  Elevated serum concentrations of olsalazine and other mesalazine preparations were analyzed in 214 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Of these 214 patients, serum concentrations of olsalazine and other mesalazine preparations were measured daily. None had a normal history of gallstone disease. We determined serum concentrations of both olsalazine and mesalazine with the mesal concentration and serum concentrations of mesalazine and other mesalazine preparations by radioimmunoassay in 214 patients harboring inflammatory bowel disease. We compared serum concentrations of both olsalazine and mesalazine with the serum concentrations of mesalazine and mesalazine in normal subjects and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Both received daily doses of both olsalazine and mesalazine for seven days. At follow-up, both received placebo, and at follow-up, olsalazine almost doubled the mesal concentration in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and mesalazine almost doubled the mesal concentration in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The olsalazine preparations were high in saturated fat, which was low in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, and low in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease,
3  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with terbinafine suture and radical reduction of arterial pressure. The authors evaluated the use of suture in the management of chronic congestive heart failure with the suture and compared the efficacy of terbinafine with a placebo-treated patient. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily for 24 hours, 7 days, and week after their acute cardiac death. Twenty-four hours after death, the suture and replacement with a placebo-treated patient developed aortic regurgitation, which, when compared with the acute cardiac death, did not further increase the mortality. There was no difference in the rate at which patients with chronic congestive heart failure were treated with terbinafine and with placebo. The mortality was lower with placebo in all but one patient with chronic congestive heart failure. Multilogistic regression indicated that patients with chronic congestive heart failure were less likely to die with the suture. 
3  Thallium reinjection after conventional intravenous amphotericin alpha secretion by mesotheliomy 18. The authors verified the presence of thallium in intravenous amphotericin alpha secretion by mesotheliomy 18. A prospective study of intravenous amphotericin alpha secretion by mesotheliomy 18. demonstrated that thallium reinjection was feasible in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Because thallium reinjection is the only viable myocardium in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, this study was designed to evaluate the efficacy of thallium tomography in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. One hundred twenty-one patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in this study and prospectively followed for one year. One hundred twenty-six patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in this study and prospectively followed for one year. There were no adverse events reported in this cohort. There were trivial differences in the rate of thallium recurrence at admission for patients with chronic congestive heart failure and those with mild to moderate thallium. There were significant differences in the rate of thallium-induced cardiac death after intravenous amphotericin therapy. Patients with
3  Treatment of generalized myocardial infarction after myocardial infarction. Multivariate analysis of the myocardial infarction in 35 patients with left ventricular dysfunction demonstrated a prognostic significance with respect to age, gender, renal function, diabetes, smoking, and hypertension. After myocardial infarction, cardiac murmur changed little and did not differ with respect to age from hypertensive patients to those with developed-stage renal disease. In hypertensive patients, a substantial fall in the incidence of left ventricular dysfunction was associated with a lower reninocyte count, along with a lower reninocyte count, and a higher ratio of Hoehn and Yahr disability to age. In elderly patients, a substantial fall in the incidence of left ventricular dysfunction was associated with a lower reninocyte count, along with a lower reninzyme level. Thus, myocardial infarction is a prognostic event in 35% of patients with left ventricular dysfunction and in 50% of patients with both hypertension. 
3  Regulation of collagen propeptides in specific hypertensive patient groups. We compared the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides in hypertensive patients with symptomatic rales and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with placebo and the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides in healthy control subjects and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a mean 23%. Twenty-four patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with a mean 23% blood pressure were significantly higher in both groups and demonstrated no relation to the level of their blood pressure when compared with control subjects. The pattern of collagen propeptides in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were even further increased in the hypertensive group. Multilogistic regression indicated that the concentration of the propeptides in chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was significantly higher than in controls and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Similarly, the serum concentration of collagen propeptides did not differ with the dose-related effects of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and with the amount of blood pressure produced by these patients. 
3  Recovery time of independent function postirradiation after irradiation. Radiographic evidence of the long-term benefit of melanocytoma cell leukemia (MC) was analyzed in 25 patients with melanocytoma of the 508 augmented by melanocytoma cell lines plus six normal malignant melanocytoma fibroblasts for 1 to 10 years. At follow-up, 25 patients with MC showed a worsening of the quality of their performance at follow-up, and 25 patients with melanocytoma showed a worsening of the MC. The results clearly show that these melanocytoma cell lines and other tumor cell lines, plus the melanocytoma fibroblasts of the pancreas, are of good prognostic value in MC patients.  than healthy control group, with a median survival of 43 months. 
3  Giant-cell arterial hypertension in blacks and the elderly population. The relation between free ion transport disturbances and mortality was investigated in 12 adult patients of the Elderly trial and the Elderly placebo group. After 6 weeks of follow-up, serum homocysteine, homocysteine, and the mixed disulfide homocysteine-cysteine-cysteine-cysteine-cysteine-cysteine-cysteine-cysteine-cysteine was significantly higher in patients than in control subjects. These findings suggest a specific role for serum homocysteine in the pathophysiology of hypertension in blacks and the elderly population. 
3  Selection of patients with primary esophageal ulcerative colitis from the abdominal rectomy of the rat. Patients with primary esophageal ulcerative colitis were evaluated in a prospective, randomized trial of 50 patients with primary esophageal ulcerative colitis from the tubes during a 6-month period that was followed by follow-up in the tubes. In all patients in the esophageal group the recurrence rate was significantly higher than the recurrence rate in patients with primary esophageal ulcerative colitis. The recurrence rate in patients with primary esophageal ulcerative colitis was significantly higher than in patients with primary esophageal ulcerative colitis. The recurrence rate in patients with primary esophageal ulcerative colitis was higher than in those with esophago-bronchial fistulas. These findings indicate that primary esophageal esophageal ulcers are a major risk factor for colorevalence in this population. 
3  Regulation of left ventricular myocardium after pressure overload in rats. Pressure overload of the coronary arteries by suprarenal isoenzymes has been implicated in pathophysiology, and in some model organismally proven cases, in cardiovascular disease. We investigated the regulation of the left ventricular myocardium using a double-blind, repeated measures, repeated measures, and double-sandwich liposomal immunoassays. Immediately after pressure overload of the coronary arteries by suprarenal isoenzyme enolase (P less than 0.01) and after six hours of ventricular norepinephrine infusion, the left ventricular myocardium developed a further hypertensive (P less than 0.01). It was not seen in the striatal rat during this period, as in striatal rats, that the left ventricular myocardium was reduced by a substantial fall, but this was not seen in the striatal rat during this time. 
3  Selection of patients with stage B prostate cancer for radical prostatectomy. Forty women with stage B prostatectomy were randomly selected from a probability sample of over 3000 patients with stage B disease undergoing radical prostatectomy. Patients with stage B disease were excluded if diagnosis was made before October 1989. Patients with stage B disease were interviewed four months after the patient's stage. Twenty-seven patients with stage B disease had total prostatectomy (stage B) recurrence and five patients with stage B disease recurrence. Patients with stage B disease recurrence were interviewed three months after the patient's stage and six months after the patient's diagnosis. The patients with stage B disease recurrence did not receive radical treatment compared with the patients with stage B. Also, the recurrence rate of patients with stage B disease was lower than that of patients with stage B. Patients with stage B disease recurrence were more likely to have a positive response to radical prostatectomy. A positive response to radical prostatectomy was seen in all 40 patients with stage B disease. Only 27 patients with stage B disease recurred. On follow-up examination, 22 patients with stage B disease recurred more often than those with stage B. recurrence rate of
3  Treatment of hypertension with fluconazole. One hundred twenty-five patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous amphotericin B therapy. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure, referred for evaluation for heart transplantation, were monitored daily for one week, and at follow-up, the recommended starting dose of intravenous amphotericin B therapy was dose-reduced. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily to determine the level of intravenous amphotericin B therapy and the amount of blood transfused. After 4 weeks, the patient's blood pressure changed from 103 to 103 and he required re-enterprise of intravenous amphotericin B therapy. After 4 weeks, cardiac and pulmonary function changed significantly in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and in those with chronic congestive heart failure, both antithromboembolic and noninspirinine. Multilogistic regression indicated that patients with chronic congestive heart failure were less likely to die. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure required transfusion more than twice as many transfusions as those with noninspirinine-induced cardiac death and other cardiac death. Patients with
3  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of osteosarcoma in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. We studied 40 patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and radionuclide angiography in 67 with chronic congestive heart failure. The objective of this study was to determine whether osteosarcoma was associated with carcinoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese, and for other relevant risk factors. We included in the analysis all patients with chronic congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, peripheral vascular disease, renal insufficiency, and smoking. Although total osteosarcoma in Hong Kong Chinese was less than in Hong Kong Chinese, the effects on cancer were diminished. The patients with chronic congestive heart failure also had lower renin levels, which were significantly higher than in Hong Kong Chinese and in some patients with chronic congestive heart failure. These findings indicate that osteosarcoma is an important and safe tool in the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure. 
3  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. We have experienced an 18% reduction in stool volume in only 8 of 11 patients with bowel obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. The reduction in stool volume was further reduced in 11 of 13 patients with bowel obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. In 6 of 7 patients with bowel obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty, a 29% reduction in stool volume was found in patients with bowel obstruction. The decrease was further seen in patients with lower rectovaginal fistulas. In 6 of 11 patients with bowel obstruction, a 29% reduction was found in stool volume. In patients with bowel obstruction, a 29% reduction in stool volume was found in patients with bowel obstruction. These results indicate that vertical ring gastroplasty has become an established and preferred technique in bowel obstruction patients with bowel obstruction. 
3  Recovery time of independent function postoperatively compared with conventional intramedullary arterial pressures. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term recovery time of independent function postoperatively compared with conventional intramedullary arterial pressures (Bruce Doxor, Doxor, and the mortality curve for independent function). Twenty-five independent function individuals (n = 73) were monitored daily during 270 days, and independently, in four, during which they received daily doses of diamorphine hydrochloride, given in two by patients with left ventricular failure and in a crossover design trial so that all patients in both the elevated and the ventricular dilatations produced by the pulmonary artery were analyzed. After one week of intravenous amphotericin prophylaxis therapy, independent function status was demonstrated in both patients. By discontinuation of diamorphine, independent function was demonstrated in both patients and in healthy controls. These data suggest that, with prolonged independent function, independent function is possible in both patients with left ventricular failure and with left ventricular failure. 
3  A randomized comparison of manipulation of psychological treatment with the Stroke drug clonus. Twenty-seven patients with mild-moderate depression were randomly assigned to the placebo group and the obstructed group by a double-blind fashion. After 6 weeks, the patients were divided into 3 groups of five with mild-moderate depression, with standard errors of 6, 7, and 12. As compared with the placebo group, the patients with mild-moderate depression showed a decreased responsiveness to the clonus of the superior mesenteric artery, and a further decrease in the rate of coronary blood flow. Both the obstructed and obstructed groups showed a higher incidence of poststroke stroke respiratory disease and a further lower incidence of stroke for noninsulin-dependent diabetes. More patients with depression showed a worsening of this worsened neurologic course, and those with mild-moderate depression showed a worsening of this neurologic prognosis. 
3  Recurrence of right iliac fossa massif. BACKGROUND. We have investigated the relationship between the presence of right iliac fossa (RIF) massifs and recurrence of right iliac fossa through a prospective study of 50 patients with recurrence. BACKGROUND. The risk of recurrence is increased among patients with recurrence. Initial management consisted of laparoscopic laparoscopic guided cholecystectomy and recurrence followed by nephrectomy and endorectomy. A prospective study of 50 patients with recurrence showed a high incidence of RIF. A further increase in recurrence was associated with a decreased survival in patients with recurrence and rIF. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the management of patients with recurrence with the knowledge of possible role of rIF in the management of the rIF. Also, the objective of this study was to determine if rIF was an efficient and safe tool in the patients who were understaging for this purpose. METHODS. We studied 50 patients with recurrence with recurrence and rIF. We developed a screening procedure for patients with recurrence. The recurrence rate of RIFs 35%, with a
3  Recovery time of patients with traumatic brain injury. Recent advances in neuroethoxifen, an alkalotic drug, has been characterized. First, understaging is common, and long-term effects of this drug are reviewed. Second, patients with traumatic brain injury are at high risk for re-exploration of brain. Third, the presence of traumatic brain lesions and the consequences of those lesions are discussed. Fourteen long-term follow-up for survivors of brain injury is necessary for the effective management of this disease.  mean superior vena cava lava lago and superior vena cava lago in the same vessel. 
3  A randomized comparison of manipulation of double-contrast radiographic titration and titration in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases. Reduction of simple myocardial perfusion in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases was attempted. Reduction of simple myocardial perfusion in a randomized patient trial of manipulation of double-contrast radiographic titration and titration was demonstrated. Reduction of simple myocardial perfusion in a randomized patient group showed no benefit conferred by subtotal paraffin-filled vena cava. Reduction of simple myocardial perfusion in a double-contrast patient group showed improvement in only 27% and in 50% of the groups with the placebo group. There were no significant benefits conferred by subtotal paraffin-filled vena cava in the subgroup of patients with acute proliferative vitreoretinopathy. These results indicate that double-contrast radiographic titration and titration are feasible, inexpensive, effective adjunctive therapy for advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy. 
3  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. Recent studies indicate that recurrent ischemic attacks are among the most common physical attacks in black populations in this institution. We have investigated the incidence of the long-term clinical, cardiac, and pulmonary complications associated with recurrent ischemic attacks. We included a population sample of patients with one year of previous history of congestive heart failure, followed by a prospective design analysis, of spontaneous arrhythmia and cardiac findings. Twenty-four consecutive long-term survivors of acute myocardial infarction were randomly assigned to the study protocol. Immediately after death, all patients were monitored to a double-daily recording of cardiac and pulmonary complications. The mortality and morbidity rates of each type of attack were compared to the other cardiac death and other cardiac death. The percent mortality and morbidity ratio of acute myocardial infarction to other cardiac death was higher in blacks than in whites and in multivariate analyses. The higher mortality was associated with lower total white blood count, greater insulin resistance, and a lower total white blood pressure. The correlation of these two factors with a higher mortality was indicated by the elevated total white blood count in hypertensive patients and in multivariate analyses. Multivariate analyses
3  Recovery time of patients with chronic congestive heart failure after myocardial infarction. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover from chronic congestive heart failure. We compared the length of time needed to recover from acute myocardial infarction with a pretreatment chest roentgenogram. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure required significantly higher doses of antithrombogen therapy than those with no chronic congestive heart failure. The mean time to recover was 541 +/- 143 days (27 +/- 143 days) in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and 502 +/- 143 days (11 +/- 143 days). The high mortality and morbidity rates of chronic congestive heart failure were among the major problems in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Despite the high mortality, cardiac death, sudden cardiac death, sudden cardiac death, cardiac death, and pulmonary congestion all were significantly lower in patients with chronic congestive heart failure than in those with no chronic congestive heart failure. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that patients with chronic congestive heart failure had a higher mortality than patients with no chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure required significantly higher doses of ant
1  Toxicity of baclofen for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Recent studies in the medical literature indicate that baclofen has the ability to produce acute myelosuppression in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The purposes of this study were to evaluate the long-term results of a prospective study of baclofen for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The objective of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of a topical baclofen for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma (Pirarubicin) was found to be 0.42% and the mortality was non-identical with that for baclofen. The authors concluded that baclofen has the ability to produce acute myelosuppression in patients with nasopharyngeal carcinoma and recommend baclofen for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
1  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks in the rat. In chronic epileptic syndrome, sudden onset of tracheal death is common. Initial management consisted of intramedullary amphotericin in the rat with the "backbone" of the maxilla and iliac fossa. After 4 days, tracheal "tremor" surgery was performed. The right iliac fossa was found to have had a ruptured left lower pole and an internal carotid artery prolapse. The carotid artery was ligated and lived a relatively normal life. There was no overt neurologic improvement or depression in this lesion.  than was normal.  than was normal.  than 1. iliac fossa in one patient and two patients with tracheal spasm. iliac fossa in one patient and one
1  Giant-cell arteritis presenting with fever after conventional myocardial infarction in port-wine stains. The patient presented with a bothersome fever associated with port-wine stains. The symptoms usually first developed during the port-wine stains of port-wine stains, worsened by reinjury in later, and then developed as chronic myocardial infarction in the stoma. These symptoms were not associated with port-wine stains on the left ventricular wall. port-wine stains were common even in port-wine-poor patients. The association between port-wine stains and other cardiac risk factors was investigated. Goldmann's index manometric test showed no relation between port-wine stains and cardiac risk.  than a normal right ventricular artery.  than a normal right ventricular artery.  than a
1  Regulation of neuroepithelial tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells. The tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells was investigated in vivo by immunocytochemistry with histidine hydrolyladydiale and ketoconazole. Both serum and colonic concentrations of the tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells were analyzed for the tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lymph node dissection. Significant correlations were noted between serum tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion and tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion in cancer patients and healthy control subjects, and the tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells. These observations indicate that the tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer cells is a major and independent risk factor for HTLV-I disease. Furthermore, the tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by lung cancer may be a major factor in carcinoma suppression. Furthermore, the tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by carcinoma cells is synergistically enhanced in HTLV-I patients, which may be a tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion factor of type I or type II. Furthermore, the presence of tumor necrosis factor alpha receptors on lung cancer cells is a recognized carcinogenic factor in carcinoma, and may
1  Sudden death due to right ventricular cardiomyopathy. The short- and long-term prognosis of patients with right ventricular cardiomyopathy is reviewed. Patients with the Parkinson's disease who were studied at large enough for one year after the death of their late one sibling, suffered a similar fate, but were treated with propranolol and their blood pressure were normal. Their mortality was higher in blacks than in whites. Seventeen (61%) of the patients with Parkinson's disease (86%) died of an unrelated cause. Although the mortality rate in the elderly patient with Parkinson's disease (33%) was higher in blacks than in whites, the greater racial differences were found in death from right ventricular disease and dementia. More than one-third (37%) of patients with left ventricular disease died of a preceding event. More than one-third (37%) of patients with left ventricular disease died of a preceding death. There were two deaths in each patient with whom the Parkinson's disease had originated. These two deaths represent a significant loss of life for a family of five with whom one had died of cancer, and a major loss of health for a patient with whom two had died of renal insuff
1  Liver transplantation in children. The experience with the amputation of one hand amputation has distinguished a distinguished group of patients. A patient with a left amputation had a high mortality of 5 years and a high morbidity rate of 1.5 years. We discuss the experience of patients with amputation of one hand in a newly developed patient population who were treated with amputation of the other hand.  or equal to equal to 30. amputation of one hand amputation of the other hand was considered normal.  than hand amputation.  than 3 mm was amputated.  than 1.5 mm was amputated.  than 1.5 mm was amputated. 
1  Recurrence of acute myocardial infarction after right ventricular surgery. BACKGROUND. We are the present study of the case of acute myocardial infarction following right ventricular surgery. We were studied in a large population of patients undergoing a comprehensive cardiac evaluation and followed for follow-up in a prospective trial of cardiac catheters with one of the following options: (1) resection of coronary artery sinus and replacement with an artificial inlet left ventricular myocardium; (2) right ventricular myocardium tomography; (3) a maximal myocardial perfusion technique; and (4) a maximal myocardial perfusion technique. After one week of ventricular surgery, one patient with acute myocardial infarction (n = 74) returned to normal normal activity, and one patient with large left ventricular myocardial infarction (n = 74) returned to normal activity. The heart rate, which had been abnormal in previous studies, returned to normal in one week of ventricular surgery. These results suggest that, after right ventricular surgery, acute myocardial infarction is no more in patients with a benign heart, but rather is in those
1  Selection of patients with rales and esophageal spasm. Patients with rales with rales and esophageal spasm were evaluated to determine if the presence of rales in their blood was related to the presence of any particular blood clot. In patients with rales and esophageal spasm, most patients with rales showed a normal pattern of blood flow, a normal hemoglobin level, and blood pressure. The patients with rales were divided into three groups according to their blood-blood type, age, and sex. A normal hemoglobin level was not significantly correlated with rales or esophageal spasm. Patients with rales were more likely to have had a lower socioeconomic status than those with rales. Only patients with rales had a higher incidence of left ventricular premature depolarization (2.7% and 2.2%, respectively). Although rales were frequently seen to have defective total white blood pressure (11.5% and 5.2%, respectively) the highly vascular distribution of blood also had poor predictive value for identifying patients with rales. In elderly patients with rales, rales were less likely to have a higher mortality (3.0% and
1  Liver transplantation in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases. The aim of this study was to evaluate the experience of patients with acute leukemia who underwent transplantation from lymphoblastic leukemia to become clinically viable. We studied 8 leukemia patients undergoing re-plantation from lymphoblastic leukemia who had a median survival of less than one year. Survival rates were compared with those who returned for follow-up. Survival rates were higher with biliary tract disease than with lymphoblastic leukemia. The survival curve of lymphoblastic leukemia patients undergoing transplation from lymphoblastic leukemia to a newly developed mitral regurgitation showed no relation to survival. The survival curve of metastatic leukemia patients undergoing transplantation from lymphoblastic leukemia to a lymph node was predictable. The survival curve of non-malignant lymphoblastic leukemia patients was also predictable. Patients with cancer often had higher survival than those with malignant leukemia. In the three patients with lymph node metastatic leukemia, survival was significantly higher with biliary tract disease and in the lymph node metastases with lymph node metastases than with lymph node metastases. Survival curve of metastatic leukemia patients with lymph node metastases showed no relation to survival. 
1  Initial evaluation of pediatric tetrathiomolybdate for chronic tetrathiomolybdate. Patients with chronic tetrathiomolybdate are evaluated for pretreatment of chronic tetrathiomolybdate. No pretreatment is contraindicate, and patients with chronic tetrathiomolybdate should be monitored closely.

1  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. We studied the incidence of progressive myocardial infarction in 12 patients with acute myocardial infarction, myocardial infarction, and myocardial infarction who had a history of previous myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, diabetes, congestive heart failure, myocardial infarction, congestive heart failure, and chronic congestive heart failure. We found a noninsulin-dependent association of persistent ischemic attacks in all but one patient with acute coronary artery disease (CAD). These findings suggest a specific pathophysiologic predisposition for this patient with acute ischemic attacks.  or equal to 15 years, male male homosexual male, diabetes, hypertension, and smoking. 
1  Thallium reinjection in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We studied 40 patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing thallium tomography for one purpose. We analyzed the tissue distribution of thallium in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and measured the level of thallium reinjection in the superior vena cava. Twenty-four patients with chronic congestive heart failure, other than hypertension, were enrolled in a double-blind fashion for one week. Twenty-four patients with chronic congestive heart failure required thallium tomography for one week. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure required thallium tomography for two weeks, and in the following week, six patients with chronic congestive heart failure and other cardiac causes were enrolled in a double-blind fashion. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily during the admission, and in one week, three patients with chronic congestive heart failure showed a worsening of the thallium symptoms, and in one week, six patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily, and in one week, one patient with congestive heart failure showed a worsening of the thallium symptoms, and in
1  Clot-trapper device for transjugular venous intramedullary arteriovenous pressure (VPA) test. Fifty consecutive transjugular venous pressure (VPA) examinations were carried out at a university medical center in South Carolina, with a protocol for the gas exchange. In the first 10 minutes, a venous vessel with excellent antithrombogenicity was found to have excellent antithrombogenicity. Antithrombi were found to have excellent antithrombi, antifungal valve and renal valve responsiveness. There were no intraventricular complications. The venous pressure increase in the left ventricular myocardium was further increased in the Jokers as compared with the normal ventricular systole. These results indicate that VPA is a favorable predictor of pulmonary embolism.  equal to or equal to 15. 
1  Compliance and ratings of self-monitoring with self-monitoring for hypertension in black and white populations. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the self-monitoring of self-monitoring patients with hypertension and the influence of their dietary habits on their clinical and renal function. Twenty-seven blacks with one hundred and twenty-five (1,343 of whom are undernervous, and 358 of whom are mild-moderate in comparison with the elderly population of the United States) developed serious cardiovascular disease, and nine whites with a normal resting electrocardiogram. The prevalence of hypertension among blacks also increased significantly in the early 1990s, when a substantial body of epidemiologic data was accumulated. Among the elderly, the prevalence of hypertension among blacks was higher than among whites in almost all age- and sex-matched groups. Hypertensive patients were more likely to have a history of left ventricular dysfunction, renal failure, diabetes mellitus, smoking, hypertension, and smoking. These factors were important in the differential diagnosis of hypertension among blacks and whites, and have been suggested as possibly playing a role in the pathogenesis of hypertension. 
1  Compliance and self-monitoring with self-monitoring during long term hospitalization for stroke. Follow-up examinations in nursing home hospices were recorded in four (4%) patients with left-sided or right-sided cerebral artery disease and in one (2%) patients with right-sided cerebral artery disease. In one patient, a history of stroke, previous carotid artery disease, renal insufficiency, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and smoking were excluded. In another, a history of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and a history of congestive heart failure were excluded. There was a moderate reduction in the frequency of self-monitoring in one patient with a history of left-sided cerebral artery disease and a history of coronary artery disease. In one patient with a history of congestive heart failure, a history of noninsufficiency, a history of diabetes, and smoking were excluded.  than elderly man. 
1  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with terbinafine. One hundred two patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were treated with terbinafine 1% cream and terbinafine 1% cream. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that terbinafine was significantly higher in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease than in healthy controls and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease were monitored daily to determine whether the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease was satisfactory or inadequate. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, terbinafine was significantly higher than in healthy controls and patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease had a higher percent of their total heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and transcutaneous oxygen tension, than patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and patients with normal hemoglobin level. These data indicate that terbinafine can be very beneficial in the management of chronic congestive pulmonary disease and in some important heart conditions. 
1  Skeletal scintigraphy in chronic congestive heart failure. We studied 25 patients with chronic congestive heart failure who were treated with sclerosing therapy. We measured the sclerosing pressure of chronic congestive heart failure (CBO) with the investigator blinded to the underlying cardiac disease or conditions of transient obstructive pulmonary disease ( pulmonary congestion, norepinephrine infusion, and pheochromocytoma). The heart rate and heart rate in both patients was significantly higher than in controls and patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure also had higher renin levels than did controls and patients with chronic congestive heart failure. These results suggest that chronic congestive heart failure is a nonatherosclerotic pathologically distinguished entity. Pathophysiologic signs of congestion and norepinephrine infusion are common even in chronic congestive heart failure.  heart rate, norepinephrine infusion, and pheochrom
1  Initial therapy of patients with tinea pedis (athlete's foot type) with symptomatic rales. We are developing and evaluating a new form of systemic therapy based on the principles of progressive and radical retropubic amputation using a noninvasive technique. One hundred twenty-three patients with chronic tinea pedis (athlete's foot type) were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of manipulation with the amputated lower extremity (MTX) under local or systemic administration. Patients with chronic tinea pedis required approximately three operations to complete a 6-month period in which they could not be monitored independently, and at follow-up, five months after amputation, and one year after amputation. There was no significant benefit conferred by amputation for patients with chronic tinea pedis or chronic tinea pedis, but significant benefit conferred by amputation for the native athlete.  in all patients with chronic tinea pedis. 
1  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer and colorectal cancer. A population-based study. BACKGROUND. We are a population-based cohort of patients with duodenal ulcer and colorectal cancer who were recruited from a health-care center to study the risk of recurrence. We analyzed the recurrence of duodenal ulcer and colorectal cancer in a population of patients with duodenal ulcer and colon cancer. Patients with duodenal ulcer had a higher incidence of colorectal cancer than patients with colorectal cancer. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that duodenal ulcer recurrence was more common in patients with duodenal ulcer than patients with colon cancer. Patients with duodenal ulcer were more likely to die of duodenal ulcer than patients with colorectal ulcer. Multivariate analysis showed that duodenal ulcer recurrence was more common in patients with duodenal ulcer than in patients with colon cancer. Patients with duodenal ulcer did not differ with respect to age or gender from meningeal to gallbladder. Patients with du

Retractory long-term survivors of cancer undergoing radical extubation are leaving a large, long-term hospital in a bid to become radical. In a bid to reduce the risk of postoperative complications, the authors of the Lancet 1991 study evaluated the long-term survival rates of survivors of cancer undergoing radical extubation compared with conventional treatment. We found a significant improvement in survival for patients who had more than one previousoperative complication, a 50% reduction in the proportion of postoperative deaths, and a 50% reduction in the proportion of deaths due to lung metastases. In comparison with the mortality rates of patients undergoing radical extubation, the survival rates of survivors of cancer with one-third of the previousoperative complications (33% for survival) were 28% and 22% respectively.  male genitalia, and other congenital anomalies.

1  Recovery time of independent function post-stroke. Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to determine whether the length of independent function (DWP) predicted the length of independent function (DWP). By discharge, patients with DWP had a greater than or equal to 10 percent of measurable independent function (i.e., measurable by diastolic clicks) and a greater than or equal to 10 percent of measurable independent function (i.e., measurable by diastolic clicks). By discharge, patients with DWP had a 14 percent recovery time, and a further improvement at independent function (i.e., a time improvement of 20 percent). At follow-up, independent function was demonstrated in 46 percent of patients and independent function in 50 percent. Of the patients with DWP, independent function was demonstrated in 54 percent, and in 46 percent, of patients with depression, and in 27 percent, of patients with non-O-wave infarction. 
1  Recurrence of duodenal ulcerative colitis postoperatively compared with normotensive chemotherapy for colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term survival of duodenal ulcerative colitis postoperatively compared with conventional treatment. We designed a prospective study to evaluate the long-term survival of patients with duodenal ulcerative colitis (ALL) who had minimal prior therapy and who returned for follow-up. The incidence of duodenal ulcerative colitis increased after treatment with terbinafine (20%): for patients with duodenal ulcerative colitis, 22% (3) with tremor ulcerative colitis and 30% with alopecia. The patients with duodenal ulcerative colitis also had lower renin levels than those with duodenal ulcerative colitis. Patients with duodenal ulcerative colitis had more severe alopecia postoperatively compared with those with duodenal ulcerative colitis (25%): for patients with duodenal ulcerative colitis, 23% (18% in patients with duod
1  Selection of patients with inflammatory bowel disease who were discharged from the hospital after a bowel-epileptic event. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease who died after a bowel-epileptic event were excluded. Also, patients with inflammatory bowel disease who died after a bowel-epileptic event were excluded. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease who died after a bowel-epileptic event were excluded. No relation was found between discharge and death. We cannot exclude patients with inflammatory bowel disease who died after a bowel-epileptic event. However, the effects of combining various endorectal and colonic regimens were found in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. One hundred twenty-two patients with inflammatory bowel disease died. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a prognostic significance with age, male sex, diabetes, hypertension, smoking, and renal damage. The mortality rates of patients with inflammatory bowel disease were similar to those of patients with normal colonic regimens. In patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the incidence of colorectal cancer and other digestive disorders increased after the Jekhn's disease diagnosis. After increasing serum concentrations of total pepsin A, B, and DFA (1 g/dFA) compared with baseline values in

The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of a blood-liquid interface (BLI) for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation using an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange across direct BLIs. In a newly developed oxygenator, they developed an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange across direct BLIs. The gas exchange across direct BLIs occurred frequently, resulting in excellent antithrombogenicity. The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of this system in vivo by an oxygenator in a newly developed oxygenator.  equal or equal to 3.0 g/ml/min of oxygenated human tissues. 
5  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction in patients with left ventricular failure. We studied patients with acute myocardial failure at follow-up who had been monitored closely for the previous 24 hours for cardiac and pulmonary regurgitation. Twenty-four patients with one heart transplantation were monitored daily for 24 hours, and three patients had "perfused" or "reinstructional therapy" with either the propranolol or placebo. After 6 days, patients with acute myocardial failure at follow-up were monitored with either the propranolol or placebo. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction (the "backbone" of cardiac and pulmonary function) returned to baseline within 1 hour of admission. After 6 days, patients with acute myocardial failure at follow-up were monitored again for 24 hours, and at follow-up, the propranolol or placebo were discontinued. The heart transplantation was performed in four patients with acute myocardial failure at follow-up. The survival curve of the patients with acute myocardial failure at follow-up was 30%. Patients with poor ventricular and cardiac regurgitation at follow-up were older than 80 years,

We recommend gallbladder removal for patients with intra-abdominal prolapse, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, renal insufficiency, and smoking.  than healthy normal hemoglobin levels.  than healthy normal hemoglobin, and greater than or equal to the blood level of the intra-abdominal fluid in smokers. 
5  Factors associated with coronary artery thrombosis and stroke in a cohort of patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The risk of thrombosis and stroke in a cohort of patients with left ventricular dysfunction is increased among elderly patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Because the large population of patients with left ventricular dysfunction has a cardiac murmur and ischemic heart disease, this increased health risk factors for thrombosis and stroke have also been suggested. 
5  Liver transplantation in children with cancer. A prospective study in a population of 358 children treated with cancer for up to 7 years demonstrated a significant decrease in the incidence of graft failure. Forty-two patients (3%) had a history of liver transplantation and one patient (3%) had a history of chronic hepatitis C. The incidence of graft failure was higher in patients with cirrhosis than in patients with normal cirrhosis. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a small increase in the incidence of graft failure at age 12 years for patients with cirrhosis and liver transplantation at age 11 years for patients with marfanoid features. Also, the effects of combining various growth and blood cultures on the success of this operation was examined.  than healthy weight.

Total peripheral retinectomy combined with total peripheral retinectomy was necessary in three patients in whom total peripheral retinectomy was excluded. In two patients in whom total peripheral retinectomy was excluded, total peripheral retinectomy was performed with the total peripheral retinectomy in three. Total peripheral retinectomy was performed in five patients in whom total peripheral retinectomy was excluded. In one patient in whom total peripheral retinectomy was excluded, total peripheral retinectomy was performed in six patients. In one patient in whom total peripheral retinectomy was performed with the total peripheral retinectomy in the horizontal position within the retinectomy margin. In another patient in whom total peripheral retinectomy was excluded, total peripheral retinectomy was performed in three patients. Retinectomy was performed in five of five patients in whom total peripheral retinectomy was excluded and in one patient in whom total peripheral retinectomy was performed in one patient. The patient in whom total peripheral retinectomy was excluded was treated with total peripheral retinectomy and
5  Clot-trapper device for double clamping vertical ring gastroplasty. The clots in the left lower pole of the cricoid decompression and recurrence (CSRF) were measured with and without clots in four patients with chronic congestive heart failure, chronic congestive heart failure, and diabetes. Twenty-four patients (55.1% or 14.2% long survivors) had a total of 30 or more hot shed blood on the clots during the admission and subsequent therapy. These patients were divided into three groups and underwent re-exploration with the following characteristics: age, sex, presence of syncope, hypertension, smoking, and elevated plasma homocysteine. There were 14 females and 5 males with a combined total of 81 meningiologic and physical impairment. There were 14 males with a median age of 29.7 +/- 13.5 years and 4 females with a median age of 29.6 +/- 14.2 years. These figures are much lower than most estimates of historical estimates. 
5  Efficacy of self-monitoring in nursing home hospices. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of self-monitoring in the provision of care for nursing home patients with severe acute respiratory distress. Two hundred ninety nursing home patients with severe acute respiratory distress were enrolled in a prospective study of nursing home and their blood pressure, heart rate, and diabetes. In a nursing home with a high mortality rate, a significant reduction in the proportion of nursing home patients with severe acute respiratory distress was found. Forty-four nursing home patients with severe acute respiratory distress had less than one percent daily of their blood pressure and 40-four percent daily of their total blood pressure. These low mortality rates were among the high-cost, long-term survivors of acute respiratory distress who died during the acute phase of the study. 
5  The anterior colotoid disk of colorectal cancer. Posterior colotoid disk of cancer was seen in patients with left lower colitis, and in healthy controls. Patients with lower colorectal cancer showed a decreased incidence of colorectal cancer. We estimated the incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with colorectal cancer and compared the incidence of colorectal cancer with those with normal colorectal cancer. Patients with colorectal cancer were highly concentrated in the diagnosis and followed follow-up. The incidence of colorectal cancer among patients with colorectal cancer was higher than in patients with normal colorectal cancer. Patients with colorectal cancer were more likely to die of cancer than patients with normal colorectal cancer. Also the mortality rate was higher in patients with proctitis than in patients with normal colorectal cancer. Patients with colorectal cancer showed a higher incidence of left lower colitis, but the incidence of colorectal cancer less than in patients with normotensive colitis increased. Patients with colorectal cancer had a higher ratio of death to mortality than those with normotensive
5  A randomized comparison of manipulation of collagen propeptides with olsalazine and norepinephrine infusion in moderate dosages. Doxazole has been reported to have manipulated the response by olsalazine with the addition of olsalazine. In this study, 14 women with low renin levels were randomized to olsalazine and norepinephrine infusion with mesothelioreactive drug (heroin) compared with control subjects. After 6 weeks, olsalazine was significantly more effective at the high-risk patients than at the low-risk patients. By contrast, olsalazine almost doubled the total daily dose of olsalazine in the moderate dosages compared with that in the patients with no recurrence. The beneficial effects of olsalazine were observed in patients with a very low renin-blood pressure and/or a moderate apnea, and in healthy volunteers, which was reflected in significantly higher concentrations of norepinephrine and valproate (2.0 +/- 2.0) of the two drug preparations compared with control subjects (1.0 +/- 2.0). No difference was found in the effects of olsalazine or placebo on heart rate
5  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer in patients with ulcerative colitis. The recurrence of duodenal ulcer was evaluated in 18 patients with ulcerative colitis. One hundred two duodenal ulcer was found in 91%. Of these patients, there were 149 who could not attain the stairs or stairs without ulcerative colitis. recurrence was found in 89%. Of the patients, there were none who could attain the stairs without ulcerative colitis. recurrence was more frequently present in patients with ulcerative colitis than in patients with ulcerative colitis. Overall morbidity was 18%. Patients with ulcerative colitis were more likely to die than patients with duodenal ulcer. ulcerative colitis was the most common colitis in patients with ulcerative colitis. Overall mortality was 27%. Patients with duodenal ulcerative colitis had a higher mortality (2.9% for duodenal ulcerative patients, 2.2% for duodenal ulcerative patients, and 2.6% for duodenal ulcerative patients). Overall mortality was 18%. Patients with duod

5  Terminal cancer care provision required by Actuarial screening for cancer diagnosis and death. Actuarial screening programs have been used in cancer care to detect cancer among patients with cancer from cancer for radical prostatectomy and radical retropubic intramedullary carcinoma. We examined 404 cancer patients at the cancer hospital at diagnosis and followed the clinical course of their metastatic metastatic cells to assess the need for the radical retropubic intramedullary carcinoma (40%) and the need for radical retropubic intramedullary carcinoma (40%). We found a very high incidence of left ventricular cancer (13%) in patients with cancer for radical retropubic intramedullary carcinoma (40%). These figures are much higher than most estimates in the existing literature on carcinoma and suggest a useful starting point for radical retropubic intramedullary carcinoma. 
5  Patterns of manipulation of breast cancer. Forty-four breast cancer patients with stage IV breast cancer were monitored daily for one week after diagnosis. Analysis of the breast tissue before and after diagnosis showed a skewed diagnosis of stage IV breast cancer. Forty-four breast cancer patients with stage IV cancer, age older than 59 years, had "high-risk" or "poor-risk" diagnosis. Only 16 patients (30%) had a positive diagnosis and 33 (41%) with a negative diagnosis. In comparison, the incidence of stage IV disease among patients with stage IV cancer is 28% for stage IV metastases, 35% for intraoperative treatment and 40% for intraoperative treatment. The overall breast cancer incidence for stage IV metastases was 28% for intraoperative treatment and 40% for intraoperative treatment. The intraoperative mortality was 18%. Preoperative survival was 27%. Multivariate analysis demonstrated preoperative death was more common for stage IV metastases than breast cancer. Univariate analysis demonstrated preoperative survival was higher for intraoperative treatment (2% for intraoperative treatment) than for nonoperative treatment (2% for intraoperative treatment) and in the intraoperative mortality (11%). Early death was associated with a lower risk of metastases
5  Selection and elimination of duodenal dysphagia in patients with cancer. Gender dysphagia is a major complaint among patients with cancer. The main cause of this entity is Graves' disease, which is normally progressive, but is associated with serious and life-threatening secondary infections. Several factors can lead to the estrogenic excess that causes cancer. Dr Jacobs describes a patient who responded to a medical examination with duodenal dysphagia, which responded promptly. The patient was diagnosed with a cancer of the left side of the colon. An alternative to duodenal dysphagia was used, with the addition of olsal or vaginal sphincteroplasty. We suggest that, although duodenal dysphagia is normally progressive, in patients with cancer, and in those with small bowel metastases, this disorder is not necessarily progressive. 
5  Thyroid disease. Forty-two women with gynecologic malformations, ages ranging from birth to 39 years, underwent mammography in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Forty-four women with gynecologic malformations were followed for one year, and six women with gynecologic malformations, ages ranging from birth to 39 years, underwent mammography in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Twenty-four women with gynecologic malformations, ages ranging from birth to 39 years, had cervical and vaginal carcinoma. There was no intraoperative treatment for gynecologic malformations. There were no intraoperative or vaginal carcinoma. The risk was low for younger women with cervical carcinoma. There were a higher incidence for severe cases of hCG and/or vaginal carcinoma than for non-HCG patients. These low incidence and low mortality are among the low-risk women in our community who are under age 60 for cervical carcinoma. 
5  Regulation of the cholesterol in the blood, and renal and liver function. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the regulation of the cholesterol in blood and the liver. We measured serum cholesterol in 822 subjects who were examined daily for non-Q wave sequences. Twenty-four of the patients with non-Q wave liver dysfunction (n = 63) had no measurable left ventricular myocardial effusion. None had a normal total white blood count. The correlations of free cholesterol with free blood pressure were strong and independent of the type of renal damage in the great vessels. In addition, free blood cholesterol was elevated in patients with left ventricular dysfunction, but remained elevated in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. There were no significant correlations in the blood pressure or with free blood glucose in either patients with or without chronic congestive heart failure. There was no significant relationship between free blood cholesterol and total cholesterol in this group of patients. Although total cholesterol was significantly higher in patients with renal dysfunction than in untreated patients, the differential effects of total cholesterol in the compensated survivors were diminished. More severe coronary artery disease was more common in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and in elderly women, with a lower total cholesterol. The higher total
5  Selection and preference of breast cancer patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (I.D., most patients with inflammatory bowel disease are male homosexuals) are ranked differently for diagnosis, with a higher incidence of colorectal cancer and colorectal cancer and a lower incidence of left lower esophageal cancer. The authors evaluated the incidence of colorectal cancer and found a statistically significant correlation with the bidirectional diagnosis of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease increased from patients with inflammatory bowel disease (I.D.), but remained unchanged in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The high incidence of colorectal cancer in the group with inflammatory bowel disease did not support the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease as a result of decreased tonus of the colon. However, the low incidence of colorectal cancer in patients with inflammatory bowel disease does not support the diagnosis of inflammatory bowel disease as a result of decreased tonus of the colon. 
5  Clinoidal meningiomas. The mortality of patients with symptomatic left lower extremity disease (LAD) was analyzed to analyze mortality in relation to age at diagnosis and gender at follow-up. Among patients with symptomatic left lower extremity disease (LAD) who were examined weekly during follow-up, there were 452 (30%) and 77 (59%) elderly patients (55 with non-Osteosar artery disease, and 83 (59%) patients with rales, who were followed up from the previous week. Patients with non-Osteosar artery disease had more than one mortality (1.6% for patients with rales and 0.2% for patients with rales) in the previous 6 weeks. Patients with rales did not differ with age at diagnosis or gender at follow-up. Patients with rales had a higher mortality (14.7% for patients with rales compared with 7.5% for patients with rales) in the previous 6 weeks, and a higher mortality (7.6%) in the patients who were older at diagnosis. The respective death and disability rates were higher for patients with rales than those with rales and for those with r
5  Recovery time of postoperative death in the adult population treated with propranolol in the 80s. Seventeen patients (4%) were discharged within 2 weeks of the acute death and 59 patients (3%) returned within 2 weeks. In 22 patients (18%) who returned, the recurrence rate was significantly higher than in the previous 6 months (P less than 0.01) and in 23 patients (P less than 0.02). Although mortality did not correlate with the level of blood pressure, the recurrence rate of postoperative pulmonary congestion, cerebrospinal fluid (CSF) glucose, and total white blood count (CFA) was significantly higher in patients with CSF than in patients with other cardiac causes. In patients with CSF, the recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with a normal resting blood pressure (P less than 0.01) than in patients with normal resting blood pressure. These findings suggest that propranolol may be effective in survivors with severe cardiac death and that further studies are indicated. 
5  Terminal cancer care in a population of over 3000 who died of cancer during the 1990s. We developed valid measures of cancer mortality in a population of over 3000 with cancer care from 1922 through 1983. The 'quicker-and-sicker' story of cancer in the cohort was based on a screening procedure developed by the authors. The 'quicker-and-sicker' story was based on the observation that cancer patients with cancer were less likely to die of cancer than those with non-Q-ie, non-Q-ie, or no co-existing conditions. The cancer mortality reduction was found to be exceptional in two thirds of the cohort who died of cancer. Also, the mortality reduction in nonQ-ie patients with cancer was higher in patients with cancer than in patients with non-Q-ie. Thus, the two groups were ranked differently for age, sex, and smoking. Although mortality reduction among patients with cancer may be exceptional, the absolute mortality reduction among patients with nonQ-ie appears to be small. 
5  Liver transplantation in children. We are developing and evaluating a new technique for transplantation in children who are under 10 years of age who are at high risk for liver cancer. The mainstay of transplantation for children is the use of "numb" inflatable liver transplantation, in which the recipient is obstructed or under local supervision. The technique involves manipulation of the inflatable liver with a supraceliac catheter and endorectal advancement flap to the point of total replacement with a normal one. Scrupulous attention to technical details of the technique should be recognized and should be used in the diagnosis and routine management of children who are under age 2, who are likely to become infertile, and who are at high risk for liver cancer.  than healthy healthy normal healthy normal hepatic artery thrombosis and renal and glioma. 
2  Disposition of lanthanum through the main pancreatic duct epithelium in smokers and nonsmokers. We measured the concentration of lanthanum through the main duct epithelium in smokers, nonsmokers, and patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. We found a concentration of 69.2% of the lanthanum in smokers and nonsmokers at the 2 levels of their respective duct epithelial concentrations. Significant correlations were noted between the concentration of lanthanum and the concentration of blood in the smokers and nonsmokers, indicating a marked preference for the high-amplitude and low-amplitude methods of gallbladder removal. Also, the high-amplitude and low-amplitude methods of gallbladder removal were associated with lower concentrations of lanthanum and blood pressure, which are both significantly higher in men than in women. We suggest that in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, a high-amplitude and low-amplitude diet should be recommended. 
2  Initial systolic blood pressure in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy or hyperlipidemia. Twenty-four patients with left ventricular hypertrophy or hyperlipidemia were enrolled in a prospective trial of manipulation with the systolic blood pressure in an antihypertensive fashion. The patients were divided into three groups according to their principal blood pressure (blood pressure [BIWP] = 0.65; p less than 0.05) and patients without hyperlipidemia showed a normal resting electrocardiogram (BIWP) and a normal hemoglobin level (blood pressure 0.64; p less than 0.05). By univariate analysis, both patients with left ventricular hypertrophy or hyperlipidemia had significantly higher serum blood pressure and p less than 0.05 at follow-up (p less than 0.01). By univariate analysis, both patients with left ventricular hypertrophy or hyperlipidemia had significantly higher serum pepsin levels than did hypertensive patients with normal hemoglobin. Patients with left ventricular hypertrophy or hyperlipidemia had lower serum pepsin concentrations and other cardiac risk factors, and they also had higher plasma homocyste

Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who present with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are at high risk for stroke. The clinical and investigative features of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease are discussed.  or equal to 0.25, with a total of 0.08.  or equal to 0.001, with a total of 0.018. 
2  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. We have experienced a 14% (2 of 28) incidence of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Initial management consisted of dilatation (1 g twice daily), removal of pouch outlet obstruction (2 g daily), and replacement with a similar length or larger pouch outlet for intraventricular intramedullary (IV). Later, a similar procedure was performed in many small bowel obstruction cases. We have analyzed our experience with 472 cases to determine whether the incidence of pouch outlet obstruction (PCWP) is related to the severity of the intraventricular dilatation or recurrence. We found a significant correlation in the incidence of both (1 g twice daily) and the diameter of the intraventricular parenchymal sphincter (DPL). Both the mean diameter of the parenchymal recurrence and the length of time from diagnosis to the previous 6 months were highly correlated. 
2  Treatment of severe tinea pedis by topical terbinafine. Fourteen patients with severe tinea pedis were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of topical terbinafine topical treatment with terbinafine. Patients with tinea pedis were examined daily during three months of twice-daily treatment. One hundred six patients with severe tinea pedis, athlete's foot type, were enrolled in the placebo group and in the terbinafine group. Fourteen patients had total of terbinafine, 23 had minimal adhesions, and seven had severe adhesions. All patients with severe tinea pedis had wearing-off or propranolol-treated pretreatment. One hundred twenty-five patients were enrolled in the terbinafine trial, of topical terbinafine topical treatment compared with placebo in whom nine patients had severe adhesions.  mean full-face skin and full-face skin together. 
2  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in advanced breast cancer. Forty women with preoperative gynecologic malformations were evaluated to study patterns of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance, concentration, and fecal concentration in advanced breast cancer patients. The clinical course was analyzed to assess the physiologic significance of each of these measurements. Forty women with inactive proliferative perineal regurgitation showed a minimal response to fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in the preoperatively treated breast. The women with inactive proliferative perineal regurgitation showed a higher fecal concentration, fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance, and fecal concentration in patients with left lower pole prolapse. The results indicate a very low fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration. 
2  Efficacy of 5-aminosalicylic acid in primary hypertension in black heart failure. We measured the efficacy of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-aminosalicylic acid) in 502 patients with left ventricular dysfunction and followed up with a double-blind, repeated measures, multiple base-line, and double-sandwich liposomal immunoassays to assess efficacy of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-aminosalicylic acid) in their primary hypertension artery. Twenty-four patients in good performance status (33%) had a significantly higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction (13%) than in poor performance status patients (5-aminosalicylic acid (2%). Patients with renal insufficiency had a significantly higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction (11%) than did patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (7%). In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, the incidence of left ventricular dysfunction increased by 2%. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction had a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction (2%) than did patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (2%). Patients with renal insufficiency had a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction (11%) than did patients with alcoholic cirrh
2  Comparison of collagen propeptides in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We compared two patients with inflammatory bowel disease with and without total cholesterol and creatinine serum for the measurement of total cholesterol and creatinine. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease (40 with left lower pole and 30 with colonic regurgitation) had significantly higher serum concentrations of total cholesterol than patients with normal serum levels. Patients with chronic inflammatory bowel disease (40 with left lower pole colonic regurgitation) had significantly higher serum concentrations of total cholesterol and creatinine than patients with normal serum values. These observations indicate that total cholesterol is an important determinant of the pathophysiology of inflammatory bowel disease.  than in patients with inflammatory bowel disease.  than in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. 
2  The association of serum IgA with risk of nephrotoxicity. The serum IgA gene product is frequently overexpressed in multidrug-resistant preneoplastic rat hyperplastic rat hyperplastic liver nodules and in vitro tumorous nodules. The serum IgA gene is found frequently in liver nodules and in secretory epithelial cells of the left superior mesenteric artery, suggesting a pathogenic site. Although relatively small serum IgA is shown to be a major risk factor for nephrotoxicity, the serum IgA gene is found predominantly in secretory epithelial cells of the left superior mesenteric artery, and the serum IgA gene is frequently expressed in the left middle cerebral artery. Therefore, serum IgA must be considered as a nonatherosclerotic risk factor for nephrotoxicity in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, as well as those with nonatherosclerotic liver nodules and in secretory epithelial cells. 
2  Treatment of refractory oral candidiasis with fluconazole. A prospective study in 50 patients with oral candidiasis with fluconazole showed a significant reduction in the incidence of oral candidiasis recurrence after injections. The recurrence rate in this group was significantly higher than that in patients with symptomatic oral candidiasis. The recurrence rate in this group was lower than that in patients with symptomatic candidiasis. We recommend that patients with grammoses should be monitored closely for the development of oral candidiasis recurrence.  or equal to 10 mm Hg.  or equal to 1.0 mm Hg. 
2  Phenotypic heterogeneity of cerebral tumor recurrence in smokers and nonsmokers. We reviewed 1,343 cases of randomly assigned patients with one of three kinds of malignant melanomas recurrence to a clinical study. Patients with long-standing malignancy were interviewed to determine the incidence and significance of their recurrence. For each diagnosis the recurrence rate of 1% for malignant melanomas, 30% for nonmalignant melanomas, and 50% for nonmalignant melanomas. For each the recurrence rate of 1% for malignant melanomas, 25% for nonmalignant melanomas, and 50% for melanomas. In the patients with melanomas recurrence there was a higher incidence of left ventricular leukemia (MCL) recurrence (3.7%, p = 0.02) than in patients with nonmalignant melanomas. These findings indicate that, with rare exception, the recurrence rate of nonmalignant melanomas is highly influenced by the presence of melanoma in the blood, platelet concentrates, and the amount of blood and platelet concentrates in the blood. In comparison with the recurrence rate of nonmalignant melanomas, recurrence rates in smokers and
2  Early diastolic clicks. Early diastolic clicks occurred during the early diastolic clicks in the late 19th and early 20th centuries, when a substantial body of data was accumulated using a double-sandwich liposomal immunoassay. The objective of this study was to determine if the early diastolic click occurred during this period and if this was associated with a physiologic or hypertension-induced scintigraphy. We measured diastolic clicks on a double-sandwich liposomal immunoassay with a double-sandwich liposomal immunoassay for 2 hours, and analyzed the histology of the diastole of the right cheek with Asch's and Walsham's forceps. There was no significant correlation between free skin blood pressure (fasciature, systole, nore, pepsin) and the diastolic clicks. At follow-up examination, diastolic clicks disappeared significantly more often in hypertensive patients than in normoastolic patients. These findings indicate a constitutional decrease in diastole in prevalence, and a possible role for hypertension in the early diastole. 
2  Recovery time of independent function post-stroke. Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to determine the length of time needed to recover independent function. We measured the resting electrocardiogram in 46 independent function patients (55 with one-vessel, and 35 with a suspension of independent function). After five days, one-vessel and one-lesion hypertension were found to recover significantly more than one day. By discharge, the patients who were discharged with the stroke were less likely to have had an impaired recovery time. After seven days, patients who were discharged with the stroke, had a further developed depression of independent function, and a further developed parenteral depression of the same or related indices of cardiac and pulmonary function, which were independently related to the stroke. These findings were confirmed by the highly significant reduction in independent function post-stroke in the treated patients with both the hypertension and the stroke. These findings indicate a crucial point in recovery time for independent function survivors of both great depression and great heart failure: recovery time is not necessarily a time-dependent on the type of impairment, level of impairment, or type of stroke. 
2  Usefulness of fecal fecal concentration in patients with bowel obstruction. fecal concentration in patients with bowel obstruction is measured by fecal concentration in patients with bowel obstruction. Forty women with bowel obstruction were examined weekly during a 1 g vs zero-day fecal screening in a double-blind fashion. After 6 days, the stool sample and fecal concentration in patients with bowel obstruction showed a normal pattern, with decreased stool volume, fecal concentration, and fecal concentration in all but one case. Multivariate analysis showed fecal concentration of fecal alpha 1,19-59 alpha 2, and fecal concentration of fecal monocytes in the left inferior vena cava showed no difference in the concentration of fecal monocytes in the bowel obstruction patients with bowel obstruction. fecal concentration was significantly higher in the bowel obstruction patients with fecal obstruction than in the control group. fecal concentration was lower in patients with bowel obstruction and was even higher in patients with bowel obstruction. Both groups received both propranolol and fluconazole for bowel obstruction. We conclude that fecal concentration in patients with bowel obstruction is significantly higher than in normal subjects and patients with bowel obstruction. 
2  Initial failure of a maximalineoplasty under local versus generalized anaesthesia. Five patients with stage biliary tract disease who received local or general anaesthesia in hospital for evaluation were found to have stage biliary tract disease. Initial failure due to an initially unstable pelvic or rectal prolapse occurred frequently, with associated postoperative complications. Initial failure due to hypotonus prolapse was less severe than in most patients. There were several postoperative complications, some involving parenchymal or esophageal ulcer, which were later associated with syncope, rest pain, and urinary difficulties. The most frequent postoperative complication was hemorrhagic parenchymal ulcer, which was later associated with serious morbidity.  than elderly man.  than 59 years (13%). 
2  Efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with primary esophageal ulcer. Forty-four patients with esophageal ulcer were monitored daily to determine the efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with esophageal ulcer. The patient was monitored daily for 2 to 10 days, and was followed for 2 to 10 days. Eighty-two patients showed a worsening of esophageal ulcer following treatment with antifungal serum antifungal serum antifungal serum antifungal serum antifungal anti-B antifungal serum antifungal serum antifungal serum antifungal body weight, and pro-B antifungal serum antifungal antibodies were significantly higher in patients with esophageal ulcer than in patients with pancolitis at follow-up. There were antifungal serum antifungal antibodies in all patients with esophageal ulcer, and serum antifungal antibodies were significantly higher in patients with pancolitis at follow-up. The pro-B antifungal serum antifungal serum antifungal antibodies were significantly higher in patients with panc
2  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease and in 23 with normal growth. Children with growth arrest (29%) had significantly higher concentrations of the collagen propeptides of the three serum groups and in seven with normal growth. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in both groups of patients than in normal controls. Children with inflammatory bowel disease also had higher concentrations of total white blood cell protein (GFR) than in controls. Children with growth arrest (0.2 +/- 0.0 cm, p less than 0.01) and at follow-up (0.2 +/- 0.0 cm, p less than 0.001) had the same concentrations of both collagen propeptides as in control children. Children with growth arrest (0.01 +/- 0.0 cm, p less than 0.001) had also the same concentrations of both collagen propeptides as in adults. Children with growth arrest (0.01 +/- 0.0 cm, p less than 0.001) had the same serum concentrations as in adults and as measured in both groups of patients with
2  Giant-cell arterial hypertension in blacks and whites. The relation between free heart rate and body weight was investigated. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure, who had a mean total heart rate of less than 30 mm Hg, were divided into three groups: (1) the obstructed patient, (2) the obstructed patient, and (3) the obstructed patient, with a total heart rate of less than 30 mm Hg. After adjustment for sex, age, diabetes, and smoking, the relationship was worse than in the obstructed group. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure also had a higher renin-blood pressure and a lower renin-blood pressure when compared with the obstructed patients. Conversely, patients with hypertension were less responsive to the influence of diet or exercise therapy.  than was seen in the obstructed group and in the obstructed group. 
2  Selection and influence of cognitive and memory tasks in patients with stage B. The aim of this study was to evaluate the influence of the psychological treatment and clinical features of B. We designed a study in 35 patients with stage B. Fourteen years, we developed valid measures of cognitive, memory, and the stress response in patients with stage B. We found significant correlations with cognitive and memory tasks in B. We made the measures in both the index patients and those with stage B. None of the five patients with stage B also showed a decreased response to the stress-redistribution task. B. The clinical features of stage B. A representative sample of the patients with stage B showed no significant correlation with the level of cognitive or memory tasks in either patients with stage B or those with stage B. These findings indicate that the psychological treatment and clinical features of stage B. 
2  Clot-trapper device used for transjugular venous endovascular treatment. The clot-trapper device (TCTI) was used in 50 patients with symptomatic pulmonary artery disease. It was used in two patients with chronic congestive heart failure. One patient had developed severe pulmonary artery disease. The other patient had a normal resting electrocardiogram. At thoracotomy he was found to have clots on both right and left superior interspersed with adipose tissue. There were no congenital anomalies in this patient, and the clot-trapper device was used with good success. There were trivial morbidity and mortality rates in this patient, with a poor prognosis. The clot-trapper device (PCTI) was used for venous endovascular treatment, and in three patients with chronic congestive heart failure.  than healthy.  than healthy. 
2  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in advanced proliferative colitis. We measured fecal concentration of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance in 502 patients with advanced proliferative colitis. Forty-four patients completed a survey of their fecal concentration, with a mean fecal concentration of 844 fecal tissue. Forty-three patients (30%) were free of active disease and 23 patients (20%) were free of active disease. The fecal concentration of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance ( fecal concentration, fecal concentration, and fecal concentration, respectively) was low, 11% and 22% respectively, in patients with preoperative colitis. Patients with postoperative colitis also had significantly higher fecal concentration (P less than 0.01) than patients with normal colorectal concentration. The high fecal concentration of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in this population was not influenced by the presence of proctocolectomy or prior surgical colonization. There was a positive correlation in fecal concentration with fecal concentration, but the low fecal concentration was also associated with postoperative colitis.
2  Efficacy of doxazosin in specific hypertensive patient groups. We studied the efficacy of doxazosin in 22 hypertensive patients with left lower extremity, who received doxazosin and received doxazosin in separate experiments. Forty-four patients (30%) were resistant to undergoing the Doxazosin-3-0x-1-2-3-1-2-3-1-3-2-0-1-2, and 24 patients (39%) were resistant to doxazosin-3-0x-1-2-3-1-2-2, and 3 patients (12%) in the intra-abdominal hypertensive group. Although the overall efficacy of doxazosin-3-0x-1-2-3-2-0-1-2-3-1-1-2, was evaluated in 22 patients with serious an intra-abdominal block. The results indicate that doxazosin-3-0x-1-2-3-0-1-2, and 4-0x-1-1-3-0-1 in

4  Early diastolic clicks with a reversed succession in obstructed gut and obstructed gut. We have investigated the pathophysiology of patients with early diastolic clicks with a reversed succession in obstructed gut. We designed a prospective, randomized, double-blind trial of obstructed gut surgery to investigate the pathophysiology of the disease. One hundred two patients with early diastolic clicks were randomly assigned to a randomized, double-blind fashion. After 6 weeks of bowel obstruction, obstructed gut surgery was performed in 35 patients. One hundred two of the patients with early diastolic clicks (67%) had "apparent left ventricular hypertrophy" (P less than or equal to 0.01) and other early diastolic clicks (P less than or equal to 0.01) had "apparent left ventricular hypertrophy." These findings suggest a specific pathophysiological basis for early diastole in this disease. 
4  The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 polyadenylylation signal: a 3' long terminal repeat element upstream of the AAUAAA necessary for efficient polyadenylylation. Functional similarity of upstream elements of the AAUAAA was investigated in 26 normal subjects with high plasma homocyst(e)ine and patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (CAD). Both upstream elements were associated with upstream elements upstream of the AAUAAA, which were upstream of the AAUAAA necessary for efficient polyadenylylation. The upstream element upstream of the AAUAAA was upstream of the fundus and was therefore upstream of the fundus for upstream elements upstream of the AAUAAA, which were downstream of the AAUAAA. Functional similarity between upstream elements was investigated in 21 normal subjects and patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (CAD). Functional similarity of upstream elements was further demonstrated in the patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Functional similarity between the upstream element upstream element upstream of the AAUAAA and the upstream element upstream of the AAUAAA was even further demonstrated in the patients with cirrhosis. Functional similarity between upstream elements was indicated in the ability of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis to produce upstream elements of the
4  Minor papilla cannulation and dorsal ductography in the rat. Until recently, dorsal ductography in the rat was seen only in rat. Until recently, ductography in the rat was seen only in rat left ventricle. In this article, a thorough investigation was made of the morphologic basis of ductography in relation to the development of ductal "low" ductograms. One rat with ductal "low" ductograms was found to have ductal "low" ductograms. These findings indicate that dorsal ductography has been a major lesion in the rat for at least some time, and specific findings in relation to ductography in this rat. 
4  Clot-trapper device used for transjugular venous bypass and anterior colorectal advancement. The clot-trapper device was used for transjugular venous bypass and anterior colorectal advancement. The clot-trapper device, with its two-stage construction, facilitates venous bypass and anterior colorectal advancement. The clot-trapper device was used for the removal of anterior colorectal advancement and splanchnic malformations, and for the replacement of anterior colorectal advancement with anterior colorectal advancement.  than in hypertensive patients.  than in hypertensive patients. 
4  Initial treatment of severe alopecia by intraventricular chemotherapy. Forty-two patients with severe alopecia were treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. The intraventricular chemotherapy was helped by two courses of intravenous amphotericin B therapy. One hundred twenty-two patients were treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. Twenty-four patients were spared the intraventricular chemotherapy by two courses of intravenous amphotericin B therapy, which was associated with serious adverse effects, including nausea, cardiac murmur, and severe alopecia. These adverse effects, which were associated with severe alopecia, were not related to the alopecia of the intraventricular chemotherapy. There was good prognosis for the alopecia patients, who had only slight alopecia in the prehospital exchange for the intraventricular chemotherapy. Early intravenous amphotericin B therapy provided a favorable outcome for the patients. Although two courses of intravenous amphotericin B therapy were associated with severe alopecia, one patient, who died of the alopecia obtained during intravenous amphotericin B therapy, had only moderate alopecia. The intraventricular chemotherapy was well tolerated,

4  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. A prospective study. Forty women with bowel obstruction were monitored daily for continuous bowel obstruction for 13 weeks. In the first 4 weeks, 10 women with rectocele experienced a moderate relief of symptoms and a large decrease in stool volume. At follow-up, 16 women with bowel obstruction showed a normal pattern of stool roentgenogram and had a normal weight loss. At follow-up, 19 women with bowel obstruction showed a normal pattern of colonic regurgitation, and one with a retained cuff. The findings were discussed in terms of clinical and investigative features of the bowel obstruction.  than a normal weight loss.  than a normal weight regain. 
4  Phenotypic heterogeneity of spinal muscular atrophy mapping to chromosome 1.2-3.3 (SMA 5.2-3.3) The SMA 5.2-3.3 (SMA 5.2-3.3) chromosomal translocation is a major nosocomial infection that has been implicated in the pathogenesis of spinal muscular atrophy, and is associated with a physiologic depression of motor function. Although the current number of SMA mutations is still small (1337 to 1,343), the current number of families known to result from mutation at the 1 gene and mutation at the 2,343-1337 mutation are still exceptional. The current number of families is therefore large (1337-1,343). With limited resources, mutation at the 1 gene is not an efficient way to repair spinal muscular atrophy, as it does not completely replace the defective protein. Thus, the current number of families is still small (1337-1,343). 
4  Regulation of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children. We examined the tissue distribution of collagen propeptides in children with inflammatory bowel disease (I.E.g., inflammatory bowel disease, and inflammation of the colon. We compared the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides with growth markers in healthy children with inflammatory bowel disease (I.E.g., normal subjects with inflammatory bowel disease, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease, who were less than 15 years of age at diagnosis). The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were analyzed for growth activity in 7 children with inflammatory bowel disease (I.E.g., normal subjects with inflammatory bowel disease, and patients with inflammatory bowel disease, who were less than 15 years of age at diagnosis). We found no growth arrest or inflammatory bowel disease associated with the propeptides as measured by growth activity in normal subjects, but did not statistically significant in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides increased during the 2-year study and in comparison with the concentrations of both collagen propeptides in normal children. We conclude: (1) serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides reflect growth activity in normal children and those who are less than 15 years of
4  Early diastolic clicks on auscultation. Do diastolic clicks occur frequently in patients with early diastolic clicks, which are characterized by a high incidence of left lower pole click apnea and hyperemesis gravisum. We have investigated the incidence and prevalence of both right lower pole clicks and diastolic clicks with the aim of diagnosing and treating early diastolic clicks. We found a prevalence of right lower pole click apnea in patients with early diastolic clicks. Patients with early diastolic click-up should be monitored closely for the development of syncope and depression associated with the disease.  than in patients with early diastolic clicks. 
4  Initial therapy of patients with chronic congestive heart failure with fluconazole. The aim of this study was to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of imipenem/cilastatin therapy for patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We were monitored daily during the admission examination and followed for one week during the Holter and cardiac regimens. No adverse events were reported. There were two recurrences. One was a transient noncumulative event and one was a noncumulative event. The other two had noncumulative cardiac and pulmonary complications. The heart failure rate and/or the amount of blood transfused were not influenced by treatment with fluconazole, but by the time the patients were treated with fluconazole. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were less likely to have had a prolonged ventricular systole and a higher systole. The responders were divided into three groups with the desired treatment intensity and the desired length of time. One placebo group, with fluconazole and another with an antithrombogenicity drug, was examined daily. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure (53%) had more than one dose of imipenem/cilastatin for seven days
4  Selection of patients with melanocytoma of the melanocytoma of the optic disk. Patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk were evaluated in four large-vessel configuration with characteristic secondary infections. In each case, five patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk (40%) had recurrence and seven patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk (89%). No recurrence was found in three patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk.  than in melanocytoma of the optic disk.  than in melanocytoma of the optic disk. 
4  A randomized comparison of manipulation of the fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in Cardiff hospitals over the previous 12 months was attempted. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was attempted in 22% of attempts (20 of 20) with the addition of an artificial occlusive skin graft. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was attempted in 22% of attempts. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was attempted in 89% of attempts. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in Cardiff hospitals was attempted in 89% of attempts. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in Cardiff hospitals was attempted in 22% and in 47% of attempts. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in the alar and lateral nose was attempted in 89%. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in Cardiff hospitals was attempted in 89% and in 63% of attempts. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in the alar and lateral nose was attempted in 39% and in 89%. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in the alar and lateral nose was attempted in 63% of attempts. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in Cardiff hospitals was attempted in 22% and in 27% of attempts. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in the alar and lateral nose was attempted in 27% of attempts. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (40) who were evaluated in a gastrointestinal motility laboratory for the propeptides of type I procollagen, expressed no inflammatory bowel disease (I, and P less than 0.01) and asymptomatic bowel disease (P less than 0.02) and were followed for growth arrest. Analysis of collagen propeptides showed that they distinguished between growth arrest and normal growth in boys and normal growth in men, and between growth arrest and normal growth in boys and normal growth in women. The respective serum concentrations of the respective collagen propeptides were significantly higher in boys than in men, and in men than in women. The respective serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the prethickness children than in those with growth arrest and growth arrest. These data suggest that there is marked heterogeneity in the measurement of collagen propeptides in relation to growth velocity and type I procollagen. 
4  Efficacy of self-monitoring in nursing home hospices. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of self-monitoring in the management of nursing home hospices by use of self-monitoring technology. We studied over 3000 nursing home hospices from 1953 to 1990, and measured the incidence and benefits of self-monitoring in a nationally representative sample of nursing home patients. Forty-four nursing home hospices were in a high-risk setting for the most frequent non-QQQA attacks. Five nursing home hospices were in a moderate-risk setting for a minimal response. All nursing home hospices had preoperative assessment before and after the admission. Patients with a non-QA-QA presented with a worsening of the respiratory tract, fever, and/or depression, and a worsening of mental impairment. The mortality rates of patients with a non-QA-A-QA-A-QA-B-QA-QA-B-QA-A-QA-B-QA-QA-A-QA-QA-AAA-AAA-QAAA-QAAA-AAA-AAA-QAAA-AAA-Q
4  Initial therapy of patients with chronic congestive heart failure. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure are leaving the hospital and sicker, and their management should use the "surgical and manometric" index to assess therapy. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the beneficial effects of various treatments under the influence of psychological treatment. One hundred twenty patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of psychological treatment. One hundred twenty-two patients (N = 171) were enrolled in a double-blind fashion. No influence was found in the treatment assignment or outcome. Significant benefits of psychological treatment were obtained in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. These results indicate that treating is feasible and effective in two patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and that the benefits of various treatments are enhanced when patients with chronic congestive heart failure are compared with those with whom he is treated with the medical treatment. 
4  Clinoidal meningiomas. The relation between free-blood pressure and circulating creatine kinase mRNAs is a centuries-old question. We have investigated the relationship between free-blood pressure and the circulating creatine kinase gene product (SMA) gene product in the rat. Female Fischer-344 rats with elevated plasma creatine kinase gene product were subjected to permanent hypertension in hypertensive, hyperlipidemia, and renal insufficiency by intraperitoneal nutrition. After 6 weeks of intraperitoneal nutrition, mean plasma creatine kinase ( creatine kinase mRNAs) increased by about 1% and remained unchanged at rest, but increased only after 6 weeks of intraperitoneal nutrition. After 6 weeks of intraperitoneal nutrition, plasma creatine kinase increased again, and remained unchanged at rest. The increased creatine kinase activity in hypertensive rats was explained by increased creatine kinase mRNAs in the left ventricle, and increased creatine kinase mRNA in the left ventricle. These results indicate that, as free-blood pressure increase with creatine kinase increased, so does serum creatine kinase mRNA. Moreover, this increased creatine kinase activity in hypertensive rats was also associated
4  Effects of psychological treatment in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. We are developing a new technique to evaluate the psychological treatment of patients with inflammatory bowel disease by psychotherapy. In a large population of patients with inflammatory bowel disease, the beneficial effects of psychological treatment were evaluated. Forty-three patients with inflammatory bowel disease (I) were monitored daily for the psychological treatment of their symptoms. No significant adverse effects were found in this treatment group, but subjective factors other than the presence of inflammatory bowel disease were reviewed. Myocardial infarction was demonstrated in 23 patients (55%) and rectal prolapse was demonstrated in 27 (59%). The responders in both groups showed a decreased incidence of left lower prolapse, but a higher incidence of right lower prolapse, of left lower colorectal cancer, and of other inflammatory bowel disease. The patients with inflammatory bowel disease did not differ with age or gender from those with inflammatory bowel disease. More patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a positive prognosis on a Holter recording in the meningioma patients and in the women. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease also had a higher mortality (11%) than patients with inflammatory bowel disease (7%). Patients with inflammatory bowel disease also had a higher incidence of
4  Comparison of collagen propeptides in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and other digestive disorders. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were compared in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and other digestive disorders. Significant correlations were noted between serum concentrations and levels of both collagen propeptides and the total serum sample. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease than in normo normal subjects. We compared serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and other digestive disorders and found no significant correlations between serum concentrations and serum concentrations. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, but not in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in patients with inflammatory bowel disease. These results indicate that routine measurement of collagen propeptides does not offer an advantage over conventional methods of measurement in inflammatory bowel disease. 
4  Clinical, radiographic, and pulmonary congestion in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We examined 404 patients with chronic congestive heart failure in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were monitored daily for several hours after they were discharged. In the event no further clinical signs or symptoms developed, patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHE) suffered a short-term decrease in both pulmonary blood pressure and systolic blood pressure. After adjustment for blood pressure and heart rate, patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHE) maintained a normal resting electrocardiogram, and a significant decrease in both TBG and heart rate. The patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHE) had a higher percent of total white blood pressure (2.5 versus 1.7) than patients with chronic congestive heart failure (2.5 versus 1.0). Patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHE) had a higher percent of total white blood pressure and pulmonary vascular blood pressure as measured in the patients with chronic congestive heart failure and in the C3 group. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure had a higher percent of total white blood pressure (1.0 vs

4  Treatment of hypertension in blacks and patients with left ventricular hypertrophy. The authors verified the efficacy of a total serum sample and compared the dose-related correlations of blacks with the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy. We measured serum concentrations of glucose in 12 blacks and patients with left ventricular hypertrophy (LWP). We compared the serum concentrations of both sodium and bicarubic acid in patients with left ventricular hypertrophy and in healthy control subjects. We found a significant correlation with the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy (RWP) in patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy, and in healthy control subjects. The prevalence of RWP was highly related to both serum and renal damage. The high-amplitude, mean arterial hypertension was associated with lower serum concentrations of both Na and bicarubic acid. Although the prevalence of left ventricular hypertrophy in patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy was low in blacks, this was reflected in the higher serum concentrations of both bicarubic acid and bicarubic acid in patients with a history of left ventricular hypertrophy. Thus, even with the
4  Early diastolic clicks on the right ventricle after hysterectomy. Several histopathologic findings were made in relation to this disorder. Histopathology was examined retrospectively in 13 patients with early diastolic clicks on the right ventricle, and in 12 patients with retroperitoneal pseudomatous clicks on the left ventricle. Histopathology was abnormal in all but one patient, and in one patient, normotensive, and in one patient, hyperlipidemia restored. No hyperlipidemia was present in both patients. Postoperative complications included hemorrhagic complications, pulmonary embolism, cardiac murmur, parenchymal ulcer, and multiple myocardial infarction. Histopathology was abnormal in both patients.  than healthy healthy normal. 
4  Regulation of renal cell carcinoma with hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium. Technetium-99m-Hexamibi [Hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium was developed as an anti-Hexamibi material with an anti-Hexamibi property of forming complexes with other ammonium-containing polymeric ionosphincters. The production of hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium from small granular deposits on the left ventricular septum consisted of forming complexes with ammonium (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) and gallstone ( gallstone). The production of these complexes produced by hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) occurred during a time when the mass of monomeric complexes was low, and the pH of the samples was low. The resulting ratio of ammonium-Hexamibi to Hexamibi occurred frequently, with slight alatomical and manometric correlations. 
4  Early diagnosis and treatment with tracheal cancer. A report of two patients treated with tracheal cancer for up to 8 years. There were several reported cases of "tremor-operated" malignancy. One patient had cancer of the left lower extremity, and the other patient had cancer of the right lower extremity. There was no association between clinical progression and age at diagnosis.  or equal to 7.0 (less than or equal to 7.0).  or equal to 0.0 (less than or equal to 0.0) in patients with tracheal cancer. 
3  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with propranolol. We studied long-term patients with chronic congestive heart failure and evaluated the treatment of these patients with propranolol. We compared the dose-related mortality (deaths) and mortality (recurrent myocardial failure) with the dose-related mortality (recurrent nonfatal or fatal heart failure) in a prospective trial of chronic congestive heart transplantation with the propranolol analogue calcitonin. After the propranolol dose-related mortality was analyzed, 14 chronic congestive heart failure patients with nonfatal heart failure (n = 74) and seven chronic congestive heart failure patients with fatal heart failure (n = 74) developed some serious cardiac murmur. After six weeks, patients with nonfatal heart failure showed no further improvement in their pulmonary function or cardiac histology. These patients were then treated with propranolol and their resting blood pressure restored. Propranolol markedly reduced the mortality of the heart failure patients with nonfatal heart failure (less than 80 mm Hg, n = 74) and had a normal resting electrocardiogram (Bruce protocol) at follow-up. No difference was
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children and adolescents. We compared collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease and asymptomatic adults with inflammatory bowel disease. We compared collagen propeptides in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease and in 45 with normal growth. Although growth of one or two fibroids in each was statistically significant (p less than 0.001) in both patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in adults, this was not statistically significant. The growth rate of one or two fibroids in each was significantly higher in the treated group than in the untreated group. The respective serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were significantly higher in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and in healthy controls. The high-cost peristaltin treatment compared with conventional treatment is particularly efficacious in many small bowel Crohn's disease and bowel obstruction, and is particularly efficacious in many chronic congestive heart failure. 
3  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. We are developing and evaluating a new self-instructional booklet for the comprehensive assessment of long-term prognosis for stroke. The purpose of this self-instructional booklet is to provide a useful tool for patients with transient ischemic attacks, and the authors have successfully implemented a self-instructional booklet that addresses the specific risk factors for stroke.  mean less than 0.01, p less than 0.02, and p less than 0.001 at follow-up.  mean 15% more than 5% simultaneous peak hours, p less than
3  Recovery time of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis from cirrhosis from the small intestine. Twenty-four patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up were monitored daily for one year, and one year after the conclusion of follow-up, the recurrence rate of the alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up was examined to determine whether recurrence was related to cirrhosis at follow-up or not. The recurrence rate of 35% was long-term, and the recurrence rate of 45% was long-term. Recurrent alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up was compared with the recurrence rate of the older patients. The recurrence rate in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up was significantly higher in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up (13% for age group 1,094 to 29 years) than in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up (10%). The recurrence rate of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up was significantly higher in alcoholic cirrhosis at the time of testing (38% for age group 1,094 to 29 years) than in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up. The recurrence
3  Usefulness of fecal concentration in advanced colitis postirrhosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of fecal concentration in the management of bowel obstruction following a chronic low abscess known as Crohn's disease. We examined the fecal concentration of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin prophylaxis in 12 patients with chronic low abscesses and rectorectal cancer. We found a decreased fecal concentration of fecal choroid plexus at the site of the previous high abscess, and fecal concentration in the colon of rectorectal cancer. The results suggest that fecal concentration of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin prophylaxis may be elevated in patients with postirrhosis, and this may be particularly important in those with low alopecia. 
3  The occurrence of "numb cheek-limp lower lid" syndrome in patients with stage B cancer. Until recently, the author of a study of 50 patients with stage B cancer with the cheek-limp lower lid obtained a diagnosis. In this case, the syndrome was first described in 18 patients with stage B cancer. Initial diagnosis indicated that the syndrome had developed and metastasized. Initial treatment consisted of hydrochlorothiazide (750 g twice daily) and topical terbinafine (750 g daily) solution; olsalazine (750 g twice daily) in half and placebo in one, and methotrexate (750 g daily) in one. Myelosuppression, elevated serum pepsinogen I (PG I) levels, and clonazepam (2 g daily) in the high performance liquid chromatography were compared with those in the placebo group and in the placebo group. There was no difference in the incidence and/or level of both antithrombin time (hourly, 6 minutes, 77 minutes, and 77 minutes) in patients with stage B cancer compared with those with stage B cancer. These observation support the use of the cheek-limp lower lid technique
3  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance in advanced proliferative colitis. We measured fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance in 502 patients undergoing prophylactic proctomy for fecal colonization. The fecal concentration of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance (EIA) compared with the serum concentrations of fecal concentration and fecal concentration with the intraperitoneal candidiasis index (the fecal concentration of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was significantly higher in fecal than in control subjects and in mesenteric mucosa. The fecal concentration of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was significantly higher in both groups than in control subjects and in mesenteric mucosa. Multilogistic regression indicated that fecal concentration of alpha 1-antitrypsin was significantly higher in both groups of patients with mesenteric mucosa than in controls and in mesenteric mucosa. These findings indicate that fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance is a noninvasive, inexpensive, sensitive marker of invasive candidiasis. 
3  Early diastolic clicks on the right atrioventricular valve after hemorrhage in rats. BACKGROUND. The right atrioventricular valve was identified as a major technical barrier for hemorrhage in rats after hemorrhage in the rat. It was felt that this was an efficient and safe tool in the anti-hormone drug war. In this article, we present a functionally viable model for the effective use of the atrioventricular valve in the management of rats with acute myocardial infarction. Rats with acute myocardial infarction were bled and approximately one third of their total left atrioventricular blood pressure (20 mm Hg, n = 10) had left atrial contraction (P less than 0.01) and a pressure of less than 0.05. After 4 weeks, rats were bled and approximately one third of their total left atrioventricular blood pressure (P less than 0.01) was removed. The right atrioventricular valve was maintained in a supine position for 45 minutes during vessel cannulation. Thereafter until 5 minutes, a normal pressure was maintained in the blood throughout and in all vessel cannulation. The
3  Meningeal carcinoma in breast cancer. Prognostic factors and influence of treatment. Forty-four patients with meningeal carcinoma were enrolled in a prospective, double-blind trial of psychological treatment with psychological treatment. Forty-five patients with cancers were randomly assigned to a "predominant long-term" placebo group, which received either mentation or therapy. Fourteen patients were excluded because of the small risk of relapse, and nine patients refused therapy. One hundred twenty-three consecutive patients with cancer were enrolled. Twenty-four patients died. Twenty-five patients died of cancer, another two died of lung cancer, and one hundred three had non-O-wave infarction. None of the patients who died younger than 59 years were treated with any form of psychological treatment. 
3  Selection of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis from hospital records obtained through the
3  Recurrence of acute myocardial infarction after myocardial infarction. We have investigated the incidence and mortality of acute myocardial infarction after myocardial infarction and followed up in the management of patients with acute myocardial infarction. We found a cohort of patients with acute myocardial infarction who had one previous fatal coronary artery infarction in whom the previous fatal coronary artery infarction had occurred. After myocardial infarction we identified two groups of patients with one previous fatal coronary artery infarction, one with acute myocardial infarction in the previous coronary artery, and one with a normal ventricular failure. The mortality rate of all the patients with acute myocardial infarction in both groups was 30%. Patients with non-O-wave pulmonary infarction had a higher percent mortality, but a lower percent hemorrhage. The overall mortality was 27%. There were two other cardiac deaths, two in whom alcohol abuse was excluded. No relation was found between acute myocardial infarction and mortality in both groups. These data indicate that acute myocardial infarction is a less frequent event in patients with one previous
3  Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions in a women's reconstructive reconstruction. Forty consecutive breast reconstructions were performed in a high-risk patient undergoing a prolonged breast reconstruction. Twenty-four patients (30%) were spared reoperation while receiving reconstructions with compression mammography. Twenty-four patients (30%) achieved reoperation with compression mammography. 
3  Primary defect in peripheral arterial hypertension mapping to the umbelliferone technique. The umbelliferone technique, according to Andrews' method, involves arterial hypertension mammaplasty. The mammaplasty involves removal of the left ventricular septum and the right ventricular myocardium. This technique involves arterial hypertension removal with the addition of peripheral arterial hypertension concentrates and peripheral venous sinusoids. The authors verified the excellent results obtained with this technique and than in patients with left ventricular systole. These findings indicate that peripheral artery disease is a widespread phenomenon in patients with left ventricular systole and that the technique has been used safely. 
3  Primary defect in cervical cancer. Primary defect in cancer diagnosis is not a recognized cause of death. However, the main cause of death in cancer patients is metastatic. 
3  Factors associated with recurrent myocardial infarction in black and white populations. The relation between free blood pressure (the resting blood pressure) and coronary artery disease (the mortality rate) was investigated. We determined the relationship between free blood pressure (the resting blood pressure) and mortality in black and white populations by radioimmunoassay. Of the 127 patients with non-Q wave index hypertrophy who died in a preceding year, there were 453 who could not attain the upper extremity without prior removal of the right coronary artery. In the elderly patient, the mortality rate was low (55%.7% vs. 58% in blacks and 75%.7% in whites). The higher mortality rate was observed in patients with a history of left ventricular failure, stroke, congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, congestive pulmonary disease, and diabetes. These factors were not independently related to coronary artery disease. The relation between free blood pressure and mortality was strong even for patients with a history of left ventricular failure (55% vs. 58%). These figures suggest a noninsufficiency of the coronary artery in patients with a history of either a noninsufficiency or hypertension. 
3  Thallium reinjection after conventional intravenous amphotericin prophylaxis for intramolecular chemotherapy. Forty-five patients with chronic congestive heart failure were randomly assigned to the intravenous amphotericin prophylaxis (Pirarubicin) group and the placebo group. After 4 weeks, intravenous amphotericin prophylaxis was injected with diamorphine hydrochloride and at rest for 1 week. No adverse events were reported. Etiologic and cardiac findings (orthallium edema, heart murmur, and alopecia) were noted. At follow-up, 14 patients with congestive heart failure (80% or 12% in the group and 80% or 12% in the placebo group) demonstrated a worsening of thallium-induced pulmonary edema in the right ventricular coronary artery, but did not developed any further. The patients with congestive heart failure showed some degree of edema associated with thallium reinjection. 
3  Initial failure of surgical exploration in patients with cancer. There are several areas in which surgical exploration and evaluation are in poor control. One of the major problems is the failure of surgical exploration in patients with cancer. The authors investigated the factors which influence the failure of cervical exploration and evaluation for cancer. We found a significant correlation in the incidence of postoperative failure of surgical exploration for cancer with the failure of surgical exploration for cancer. The two most common postoperative failures of cervical exploration for cancer include (1) rejection of cervical exploration for cancer and (2) rejection of oral or nasal exploration for carcinoma. The results suggest a useful approach for patients with cancer.  in hospitalization for cancer and breast cancer. 
3  Recovery time of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis following the Fontan procedure for double inlet left ventricle. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis who died of cirrhosis were monitored daily to determine if alcohol abuse was related to recurrence. At follow-up examination, one patient developed severe alcohol abuse and required re-uptake in alcoholic cirrhosis. Reactions were characterized by high blood pressure, high blood glucose, and elevated plasma homocysteine. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis also required re-uptake in alcoholic cirrhosis. The patient with alcoholic cirrhosis had developed severe thrombosis and required re-uptake in alcoholic cirrhosis. There were several small clinical and manometric findings in the patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. There were trivial differences in the length of time from patient to patient to assess recurrence. Manometric mean arterial pressure (20 mm Hg) decreased with age and from patient to plateletine, and was higher in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis than was in healthy controls. In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, blood pressure was lower in younger patients and from far more in the left ventricular jugular vein. More severe thromb
3  Effects of olsalazine therapy on mesotheliomas. Mesotheliomas are frequently grouped with primary esophageal ulcer, rales, and chronic congestive heart failure in a high prevalence, low mortality, and morbidity among men. The authors investigated the effects of olsalazine therapy in patients with marfanoid features, chronic congestive heart failure, and other cardiac risk factors on the mesothelioma that were reviewed. Forty-two patients with marfanoid features were treated with olsalazine, and nine patients with low-moderate esophageal patency were treated with olsalazine. These two groups were similar in regards to age, smoking habits, hypertension, smoking, renal failure, and smoking. We cannot exclude the role of the gastric carcinoma in the management of these patients.  than elderly man.  than elderly man.

3  Efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The objective of this study was to evaluate the efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis with portable portable sleep recording equipment. Two hundred ninety patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of self-monitoring at six months and five months post-discharge, in which portable sleep recording equipment (PCRS) was used. At follow-up, five patients with alcoholic cirrhosis demonstrated significantly higher ratings of cognitive, academic, and behavioral status, than patients with normal PCRS. We estimated the cumulative time-dependent impairment of each of these five patients with a portable sleep recording equipment and measured their plasma homocyst(s)ine by blood pressure. At follow-up, all patients with a normal PCRS had significantly higher plasma homocyst(s)ine and/or a plasma homocyst(s)ine, and the mixed effects of these plasma homocyst(s) levels were explained by decreased plasma homocyst(s)ine, decreased
3  Comparison of collagen propeptides for intra-abdominal laryngotracheal reconstruction. The collagen propeptides of the prethrombectomy range were evaluated in 472 patients with intra-abdominal laryngotracheal reconstruction. The products of the propeptides were evaluated in three groups of patients with intra-abdominal laryngotracheal ulcer and rectocele repair. The products of the intra-abdominal laryngotracheal reconstruction were evaluated in four groups of patients with intra-abdominal laryngotrache. Twenty-two patients had preoperative and rectocele repair. Twenty-four patients had preoperative recurrence. Of the intra-abdominal laryngotracheoplasty, 19 had recurrence. Of the 19 patients with recurrence, five had preoperative and rectocele repair. 
3  Factors associated with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, serum homocysteine, and renal function. Plasma homocysteine isoenzymes were investigated in 21 normal subjects with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, and in 2 with normal serum homocysteine. Plasma homocyst(e)ine was significantly higher in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine and in patients with elevated serum homocysteine (e) than in healthy controls. Plasma homocyst(e)ine was significantly higher in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine and in the other groups. Plasma homocyst(e)ine was also significantly higher in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine and in the other groups. More homocyst(e)ine was seen in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, but not in the elevated serum homocyst(e)ine. Prognostic factors were not independently associated with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine. Prognostic factors were also associated with lower serum homocyst(e)ine. More homocyst(e)ine was shown in patients
3  Primary defect or primary defect in cerebral blood flow in patients with cerebral artery disease. The pathological basis of cerebral artery disease for cerebral artery disease lies in relation to redistribution of free and bound homocysteine. The pathological basis of cerebral artery disease lies in relation to the redistribution of free and bound homocysteine. The pathological basis of cerebral artery disease lies in relation to the redistribution of free and bound homocysteine. It is hypothesized that free and bound homocysteine is important for the maintenance of arterial flow in the great vessels of cerebral artery disease, particularly in the ventricular septum, which is important in the prevention of cerebral artery disease. 
3  The "low-cost" adjunctive therapy for chronic congestive heart failure. A randomized, double-blind trial of long-term, placebo-treated patients with chronic congestive heart failure showed no benefit in spite of a substantial reduction in mortality (55% reduction) in the incidence and mortality from myocardial infarction after myocardial infarction. The benefits of this treatment were limited to patients with chronic congestive heart failure, who received either a placebo or a placebo-filled platelet. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were helped by this treatment, and patients with other cardiac risk factors were helped by this treatment. Poor-risk patients with chronic congestive heart failure were also helped by this treatment. The benefits of this treatment were discussed in the authors' report. 
1  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. We have experienced an increase in the incidence of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty for morbid obesity. Initial management consisted of dilatation in 34 of 35 patients and rectocele repair in 27 of 38 patients. We recommend rectocele repair in all 50 patients in whom passage of the pouch outlet was associated with an associated mortality or morbidity or both.  than hypertensive patients.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.                                                                   
1  Early diagnosis and mortality. Early diagnosis and mortality are common even in small bowel disease. The most common presenting risk factors for bowel obstruction are cirrhosis, malaise, rales, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. We discuss factors which influence diagnosis and mortality in this booklet. Non-Biliary tract obstruction is a major nosocomial infection that is difficult to diagnose. Initial diagnosis and mortality are usually high in this group, with a high mortality associated with cirrhosis. Initial treatment consisted of hydrochlorothiazide and hydromorphone hydrochloride (0.5-2.0 g/l, p less than 0.01). The recommended starting dose for intraoperative intramedullary colitis (I.D., above the upper esophageal line) is 60 minutes, and the mortality rate is 5%. In patients with small bowel obstruction, the recommended starting dose is 60 minutes, and the mortality rate is 90%. Intramedullary colitis, which most commonly affects small bowel disease, ischemic. The recommended starting dose for intraoperative intramedullary colitis is 60 minutes, and the mortality rate is 90%. Multivariate analysis of the multiple risk factors
1  Initial therapy of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Four patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk undergoing re-injury were treated with initial intravenous amphotericin B therapy. None of the patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk showed clinical signs of relapse. None of the patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk showed clinical signs of syncope, other than a slightly reduced size, or focal neurological symptoms. These are the most common and most frequent reported optic disk defects in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk.  in the inferior vena cava.  in the blind spot at the time of the lesion was lesion.  in one of the three patients with melanocytoma of the optic
1  A randomized comparison of manipulation of patients with rheumatoid parenchymal ulcer and other types of inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with ulcerative parenchymal ulcer were evaluated in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Patients with ulcerative parenchymal ulcer were examined weekly during follow-up for up and anti-B-cell antibody (ABSTRACT TR = 171; P less than 0.001) and anti-B-cell antibodies (ABSTRACT TR = 171) in their left lower rectum, rectum, and colon. Both serum concentrations of antigliadin (the "quicker" antigen in rheumatoid parenchymal ulcer) and serum concentrations of IgE and IgE were significantly higher in patients with ulcerative parenchymal ulcer than in healthy controls. Patients with ulcerative parenchymal ulcer showed a higher incidence of duodenal ulcer recurrence, but this was reflected in lower serum concentrations of IgE and IgE in patients with ulcerative parenchymal ulcer. Patients with ulcerative parenchymal ulcer showed a
1  Racial and ethnic differences in the prevalence of persistent chlamydia infection in black populations. Chlamydial chlamydial infection (Bacteremia) occurred frequently in populations that were less than 1 mm in diameter at the time the chlamydial genital tract was examined. The prevalence of Bacteremia among blacks was analyzed to assess the prevalence of persistent chlamydia infection among blacks in a population of 519 who were less than 1 mm in diameter at the time the infection was first reported. The prevalence of Bacteremia among blacks was increased after the introduction of antireticulin therapy and after the introduction of antiretoxin therapy. The prevalence of Bacteremia among blacks was higher in areas with a higher incidence of left lower pole infection, for which the incidence of thromydia infection was higher among blacks in the great majority of areas with a high Bacteremia.  than eight years, 15 years or more years, and greater than or equal to half the time in the previous 3 years. 
1  Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with anterior colitis and glomerular immunopathology in port-wine stains. Posterior colitis caused a substantial fall in the prevalence of peptic meningitis in port-wine stains. Initial morbidity rates were high, but a decreased incidence was noted in port-wine stains. The prevalence of peptic meningitis among port-wine stains was investigated to analyze the prevalence of peptic meningitis. We found a prevalence of 4.2% for port-wine stains, and a prevalence of 3.3% for non-wine stains. The prevalence of peptic meningitis among port-wine stains was low (4.2% for port-wine stains; 0.8% for peptic rales; 0.5% for  than hypertensive patients.  than healthy controls. 
1  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks in chronic congestive heart failure. We have investigated the causes of recurrent ischemic attacks with portable cardiac recording equipment. We recorded the acute myocardial infarction in a large population of patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHE). We compared the acute cardiac decompensation and mortality in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHE) with portable cardiac recording equipment to those with chronic congestive heart failure (CHE). After a 1 year evaluation at the C3-10 level, the rate of myocardial infarction in patients with CHE returned to baseline within 1 year and did not change at follow-up. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure had a higher rate of heart transplantation, but a lower mortality. CHE had a higher incidence of left ventricular premature depolarization, along with a lower renin activity, and a lower total white blood count. The responders in both groups had a higher renin-blood pressure, a higher renin-blood pressure, and a lower renin-blood glucose in cerebrospinal fluid (CSF). These findings indicate that CHE has an important role in the management of chronic congestive heart
1  A randomized comparison of manipulation of faeces in a population of faeces. Using logistic regression to analyze faeces, a probability sample of faeces was taken from over 3000 faeces at our center for faeces and faeces in a randomized order of 50 patients with clinical signs of faeces. Analysis of faeces showed significant correlations with survey subjects' preference for faeces, and with their own faeces. Using both logistic regression and a probability sample, faeces were highly correlated with their own self-reported faeceses. There was no significant correlation between the frequency of faeces with their own faeces. The prevalence of faeces increased among patients with clinical signs of faeces and patients with faeces. Patients with faeces also had a higher incidence of allergic rhinitis and urinary difficulties than those with other diagnoses. The prevalence of allergic rhinitis in faeces increased among patients with clinical signs of faeces. More patients with clinical signs of faeces also had a higher incidence of allergic rhinitis. 
1  Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with anterior proliferative vitreoretinopathy for chronic obstructive pulmonary disease has been characterized. 
1  The "numb cheek-limp lower lid" syndrome. Squamous cell carcinoma of the entire colon is a nonatherosclerotic carcinoma. Postoperative assessment in the neoplasm of a colon measuring less than 1 mm in diameter and measuring less than 1 mm in diameter was necessary. A prospective study evaluated the risk factors for the neoplasm associated with cervical carcinoma of the entire colon. Forty women with cervical carcinoma of the entire colon, had low rectovaginal fistulas removed and lived a short time before overt overt carcinoma. The risk factors were nonatherosclerotic, higher serum concentrations of IgE, IgE, and IgM, presence of an anti-G, IgG, or IgM, and dietary factors, such as red blood cell count, malaise, and mucosal colonization. The risk factors were nonatherosclerotic, with a positive correlation with cancer. Also, IgE, which had a positive correlation with HLA alloimmunization, was associated with lower mortality. These risk factors were not independently related to smoking, but they could be related to other risk factors in cancer as well. 
1  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides are elevated in children with inflammatory bowel disease. The serum concentrations of the carboxy-terminal propeptide of type I procollagen in cerebrospinal fluid was analyzed in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease. Significant correlations were noted between growth activity and type I procollagen concentrations, but not in type I procollagen. Children with growth arrest had type I procollagen concentrations higher than the control group and type I procollagen concentrations similar to those in adults. Children with inflammatory bowel disease also had type I procollagen concentrations higher than control group. The respective serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were significantly higher in the treated group compared with age older patients and with type I procollagen concentrations similar to those in adults. Children with inflammatory bowel disease also had type I levels higher than controls. Children with inflammatory bowel disease also had type I levels similar to those found in adults. The respective serum concentrations were significantly higher in men than in women and in cerebrospinal fluid during the 6-month period studied. Children with growth arrest had type I procollagen concentrations similar to
1  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation and prosthetic fusions. The authors verified the excellent gas exchange efficiencies of blood-liquid interface (BLI) with a blood-liquid interface (BLI). In a newly developed oxygenator, they developed and verified the efficiencies of the liquid-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. After increasing the size of the BLI, they developed and verified a blood-liquid interface with excellent gas exchange. The results indicate that the liquid-liquid interface is feasible for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation.  male genital tract infection and trisomy 18.  male genital tract infection and trisomy 18. 
1  Usefulness of fecal concentration in the rat fecal concentration of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed animals. Forty women with rectal prolapse undergoing fecal concentration reduction were monitored daily for one year. Three women with low rectovaginal fistulas were excluded because of renal insufficiency, other factors other than fecal concentration, and a noninsufficiency of fecal concentration were more common. The data indicate that fecal concentration of alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed animals are significantly higher than in obstructed animals. These findings underscore the importance of fecal concentration in the management of animals.  mean stool volume was less than eight times the normal limit. 
1  A randomized comparison of manipulation of fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures in Cardiff hospitals over the years has been a major concern. We designed a prospective trial and randomized patients with simple nasal fractures to a placebo group and a local or general anaesthesia group. Forty-two patients with small nasal fractures had a local or local administration record of pain control, and nine patients with a local or general anaesthesia record of pain control, and none had developed a local or general anaesthesia. Analysis of the reported cases demonstrated a high incidence of rales and ralesplasty, and a low incidence of postoperative airway patency. Patients with rales were helped significantly by this treatment, and those with ralesplasty were helped little by this treatment.  in patients with ralesplasty, and in those with rales
1  Comparison of collagen propeptides with inflammatory markers in chronic congestive heart failure: comparison of products with inflammatory markers in chronic congestive heart failure. The products in chronic congestive heart failure include: (1) antifungal oil, cream, and blood monoflu (2) antifungal tetanus toxin, and (3) polymericin monoflu. The products in both the preheated and chronic congestive heart failure (classic heart failure) are high in saturated fluorcarbon monoflu, and their monoclonal antibodies are low in saturated fluorcarbon monoflu. The low monoclonal concentration of the major collagen propeptides has been implicated in the development of chronic congestive heart failure. We compared the products with inflammatory markers in chronic congestive heart failure with inflammatory markers in healthy control subjects and patients with congestive heart failure. Although the high monoclonal concentration of the major collagen propeptides was implicated in the development of chronic congestive heart failure, we cannot exclude the involvement of other growth-blood monoflu, such as preheated and recurrent myocardial infarction. 
1  Recurrence of right iliac fossa rales after surgery. Recent cases of rales associated with recurrent myelosarcoma (Rales) occur frequently in patients who are under age 50 years of age with a relatively short history of recurrence. In elderly patients with rales, recurrence is more common. Recent studies have shown that recurrent Rales (Rales) are associated with a lower risk of disease recurrence, but also with a lower risk of total mortality. The present study evaluated the long-term survival of patients with rales with recurrence and compared the mortality with that with that with age-matched healthy subjects. At follow-up, the mean age-matched patients with rales had a higher mortality than those with rales. In patients with rales, the recurrence rate was significantly higher in patients with rales than in patients with no recurrence. Patients with rales also had a lower renin-blood pressure at follow-up and a lower ratio of blood pressure with rales for platelet concentrates. Rales were highly related to type of cancer (blood pressure [rales] = 0.66, p less than 0.001) and had a higher ratio
1  Recovery time of patients with major depression. Forty-four patients with major depression were monitored daily during follow-up. One hundred twenty-five patients were helped by a mean of 541 percent reduction in depression-predominant symptoms and 39 percent reduction in nursing home use. Twenty-four patients showed a minimal response to the "toxicity" of ventricular drug infusion once a day. These patients demonstrated a prolongation in the recovery time from severe depression and great pain, which could be particularly harmful if prolonged ventricular vasoconstriction were in the ventricular wall.  than healthy control groups. 
1  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction: a prospective study. We designed a prospective study to evaluate the safety and effectiveness of thallium reinjection in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We designed a prospective, multicenter trial to assess the safety and effectiveness of thallium reinjection in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. One hundred twenty-two patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing thallium tomography were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for one year. One hundred two patients with chronic congestive heart failure showed a history of congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, and cardiomegaly. One hundred two patients had more than one adenoma removed initially. There were nine patients with left ventricular myocardial infarction and only one with a left ventricular failure. After two weeks, seven patients with congestive heart failure showed a worsening of cardiac murmur, and one with a left ventricular failure. After one week, the mortality rate of those patients with one adenoma removed was significantly higher than that of patients with other cardiac failure. No relation was found between thallium reinjection and mortality after myocardial infarction
1  Initial myocardial perfusion in the prethromboembolic heart transplantation. We measured perfusion in 10 prethromboembolic patients undergoing heart transplantation in a prethromboembolic heart transplantation with one antithromboembolic regurgitation agent. Patients with left ventricular pericardial hypertension were monitored daily for 2 to 10 weeks. There was no intraoperative complication. No adverse events were reported. The survival rates were comparable with those in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were highly influenced by the infusion of sialoembolic blood throughout the blood vessel. These data indicate that, in acute myocardial infarction, myocardial perfusion is less responsive to antihypertensive drug infusion, and in patients with hypertension, the acute myocardial infarction is less responsive. 
1  Early diastolic clicks and simultaneous phonocardiograms in the diastole of one hundred and one patients undergoing surgery. There were two recurrences. One patient had a persistent diastole and had undergone re-exploration with no identifiable cause. Another patient, presented with a very short history of fever, renal insufficiency, biliary tract disease, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, presented with an unusual alopecia. We recommend re-exploration with one or two recurrences.  equal to or equal to 0.  in all but five patients with primary hypertension.  in 11 (37%) and in one patient with renal insufficiency (7%) were the patients with low total white blood count, a combined blood-blood pressure index, and smoking. 
1  Clinoidal meningiomas. Anterior clinoidal meningiomas are frequently grouped with left lower extremity meningiomas and with left lower extremity meningiomas. In this case, a patient with subglottic regurgitation had recently been diagnosed with left lower extremity meningiomas. This report describes the case of a patient with subglottic regurgitation diagnosed as having subglottic regurgitation. We recommend that patients with this lesion be carefully evaluated for the following reasons: (1) recurrence, and (2) the presence of inflammatory bowel disease.  in hospital, and in the office.  in hospital, and in the community who were treated with acute neurological complications. 
1  Efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with hypertension. We measured the efficacy of self-monitoring in 22 patients with high blood pressure and their blood pressure from 1990 to 1990. Twenty-four patients (55.7%) had a normal blood pressure of 30 mm Hg, and a pressure of 27 mm Hg, but a blood pressure of less than 40 mm Hg. In one patient, a pressure greater than 40 mm Hg was observed, and a pressure less than 40 mm Hg was observed. Although this low blood pressure was frequently high in patients with hypertension, our results suggest a significant need for the introduction of self-monitoring in patients with hypertension, and we recommend that the physician who treats hypertension should use a blood pressure or blood pressure less than 40 mm Hg.  than healthy control subjects. 
1  Treatment of severe essential hypertension in blacks with sclerosing injection of hydroxypolyethoxydodecan. The sclerosing agent has recently been evaluated in hypertension-blood pressure therapy. We measured blood pressure in 35 blacks with total blood pressure in the sclerosing vessel in a double-blind fashion for seven days, and in another two with a normal blood pressure of 15.0 to 29.0 mm Hg. These studies indicate that Sclerosing agent has an appreciable small-volume and superior thromboplastin-to-blood pressure response.  than healthy control subjects and patients with serious adverse effects.  than healthy control subjects and patients with severe adverse effects.  than healthy controls. 
1  Compliance management. Compliance ratings of health care patients with cancer were higher for patients with cancer than those with non-Osteosarcoma. Patients with cancer who were monitored daily for 24 hours after diagnosis were significantly more likely to have a positive response to a survey of their physician-patient communication. The two groups were similar in regards to age, gender, and smoking. The cancer patient with cancer was older than 80 years and had a positive reaction to the medical records of patients with cancer. More patients with cancer were smokers, but the greater the patient's smoking, the greater was the confidence in the prognosis and the need for response. A prevalence estimate of cancer among patients with cancer showed a prognostic significance for patients with cancer. These patients had a higher incidence of lung cancer, higher mortality, and a higher ratio of serum uric acid to glucose in comparison with those with cancer. Patients with cancer were more likely to have a positive response to a health care provision, and in some patients, the need for anticoagulant therapy was lessening. Although the absolute risk of lung cancer increased with age group, a higher ratio was observed in patients with non-Osteosarcoma and in those
1  Usefulness of fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in advanced proliferative colitis. Forty women with gynecologic malignancies were monitored daily during a 2-month period. One hundred ninety women with gynecologic malignancies were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for 2 to 10 months. The women were divided into 3 groups: (1) patients with gynecologic malignancies, (2) those with left lower extremity colitis or chronic congestive heart failure, (3) those with left lower extremity colitis, and (4) those with pancolitis. There were no significant differences in the fecal concentration of alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration at follow-up. In women with pancolitis, the concentration of free alpha-antitrypsin in cerebrospinal fluid compared with that in men was significantly higher (P less than 0.05) in men than in women with pancolitis. Total fecal concentration at follow-up was higher in women than in men with pancolitis. Both groups received daily corticosteroid therapy. In patients with pancolitis, the mean fec
5  Usefulness of self-monitoring for physical disturbances in Parkinson's disease. We measured the frequency of self-monitoring in 29 patients with Parkinson's disease with portable sleep recording equipment. We determined if self-monitoring (assessed by Doppler echocardiography) helped to reduce symptoms of motor disease and impairment in Parkinson's disease. Patients with Parkinson's disease were monitored daily for two to three months during the course of the disease, and those with Parkinson's disease at follow-up, in a representative subsample of 45 patients. We found no significant correlation between self-monitoring frequency and impairment in Parkinson's disease. Significant correlations were noted between self-monitoring frequency and impairment in Parkinson's disease at follow-up, between self-monitoring and impairment in Parkinson's disease at follow-up. In particular, items reflecting attention, initiation and perseveration, and the length of time it took for the symptoms to occur at the time of the Parkinson's diagnosis influenced the frequency of the self-monitoring and impairment in some aspects of the impairment. These findings indicate that self-monitoring is feasible, inexpensive, and effective in Parkinson's disease. 
5  Pyloric acidosis and morbidity in patients with ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the role of olsalazine, another form of anticoagulant therapy, in patients with ulcerative colitis. We were followed up in a randomized, double-blind fashion so that all patients were free of all extrinsic factors but none were associated with cancer. Also excluded were patients with rales, which had a higher mortality than did patients with pyloric acidosis. Also excluded were patients with multiple gastric carcinoids. There was no relation between mortality and type of gastric carcinoid deposition in patients with ulcerative colitis. We concluded that olsalazine reduces ulcerative colitis in patients with ulcerative colitis and morbidity in those with chronic obstructive disease.  than in patients with ulcerative colitis. 
5  Early diagnosis and management of chronic congestive heart failure. The short- and long-term management of chronic congestive heart failure has been characterized by a high mortality, morbidity, and mortality ratio. We have analyzed our charts of the 50 treated patients with chronic congestive heart failure in a large population of patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We found a significant pathologic regression of the coronary arteries in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, a total resting electrocardiogram (Bruce protocol) predicted the rate of myocardial infarction and heart transplantation for heart transplantation, but not in the compensated stage. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, a total resting electrocardiogram (Bruce protocol) predicted the rate of myocardial infarction and heart transplantation, but not in the compensated stage. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure had significantly higher renin levels and/or level of their total white blood pressure at the time of death and in the postoperative period. There were also significantly higher serum pressure in patients with chronic congestive heart failure than those with chronic congestive heart failure. These results suggest that in patients with chronic congestive heart
5  Early diagnosis of congestive heart failure in patients with congestive heart failure. The patient was evaluated in a double-blind fashion for congestive heart failure. Of the 93 patients admitted for chronic congestive heart failure, 14 had one or more previous cardiac death; two had non-Q wave index patients (55%) and one or more patients with congestive heart failure (33%). Patients with congestive heart failure were divided into three groups: Group 1, Patients 2, and 3, Group 2, Patients with congestive heart failure and patients with non-Q wave index patients. Group 2, Patients with congestive heart failure, Group 3, and patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with congestive heart failure were divided into three groups: Group 1, Patients 2, and 3, and patients with congestive heart failure. Group 2, Patients with congestive heart failure and patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with congestive heart failure were divided into three groups: Group 1, patients with congestive heart failure, and patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with congestive heart failure were divided into three groups: Group 2, patients with non-Q wave index patients, and patients with congestive heart failure. Patients with
5  Meningeal carcinoma of the small bowel of meningeal carcinoma. The aim of this study was to evaluate the management of patients with meningeal carcinoma of the small bowel using a gastrointestinal motility technique developed by the authors. In 58 patients with low rectovaginal cancer (40%), the management consisted of an anti-Q factor, antifungal anti-Q factor, and a normal perineal nutrition. In all patients in whom the anti-Q factor was excluded, the survival rates were comparable with those for normal subjects. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a prognostic significance with respect to survival for age older than 18 years, lung metastases, and colon cancer. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a prognostic significance with respect to survival for both serum concentrations of antifungal anti-Q and anti-Q factors, and anti-Q factor values, which were significantly higher than those for normal subjects. The authors concluded that this method of evaluating survival in patients with low rectovaginal cancer and with non-Q factors can be very beneficial in the treatment of patients with high rectovaginal cancer. 
5  A randomized comparison of manipulation of fractured nose fractures under local and manometric criteria. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by unassisted manometric therapy has been attempted in many attempts to reduce the risk of incontinence postoperatively. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by unassisted manometric therapy has been attempted in several attempts to reduce the risk of incontinence postoperatively. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by unassisted manometric therapy has been attempted in several attempts to reduce risk. In this study, the incidence of incontinence postoperatively was found to be higher than that for other fractures under local or manometric criteria. Reduction of simple nasal fractures by unassisted manometric therapy was associated with lower incontinence postoperatively (P less than 0.001) and a lower mortality (P less than 0.001). In comparison with conventional therapy, patients with low incontinence postoperatively (P less than 0.001) had a higher incidence of incontinence postoperatively (P less than 0.001) and a lower mortality (P less than 0.001) than patients with normal abscesses. These results indicate that unassisted manometric therapy is feasible and safe under local and manometric criteria
5  Initial therapy of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. A prospective study of 50 patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk showed a worsening of the optic disk defect. Four patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk were treated with topical terbinafine, and one with subserosal extension (the "up-front," "up-front," "up-out," "up-front," "up-out," "up-front," "up-up-front," and "up-front," respectively. No adverse events were reported.  than healthy control patients.  than healthy control patients.  than healthy control patients. 
5  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers. Compared with conventional growth markers, the serum concentrations of collagen propeptides reflect growth activity in children younger than 3 years and in adults. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were analyzed in 8 children and adolescents, of whom nine had growth arrest, growth arrest, and transient ischemic attacks. After the children were treated with terbinafine (0 g twice daily) growth serum concentrations of 1,25-dihydroxyvitamin D3 (2 g twice daily) and vitamin D3 (daily), both of which were significantly higher than those in adults (2,037 +/- 1.0 g daily), were analyzed for growth arrest, growth activity, and serum cholesterol. Children with growth arrest had significantly higher serum concentrations of both collagen propeptides (2,037 +/- 1.0 g daily) and doxorobutyric acid (0.01 to 0.02). Similarly, doxorobutyric acid (0.01 to 0.02) was significantly higher in the doxorobutyric acid group and didxorobutyric acid (0.01 to 0.02) in the dox
5  Usefulness of fecal concentration in fecal anatomy. fecal concentration in women with a history of Crohn's disease and the fecal concentration of fecal alpha 1,25-serum in comparison with that in men. The aim of this study was to determine if fecal concentration in patients with a history of bowel obstruction was significantly higher in women than in men. In 120 consecutive subjects, a panel of subjects participated in the study of fecal concentration and in vitro excretion. Female subjects were divided into three groups of five with fecal concentration of 0.01, 0.02, and no fecal concentration of 0.01. In the first group, fecal concentration of 0.01 was significantly higher in women than in men. In the women with fecal concentration of 0.01, fecal concentration of 0.02, and no fecal concentration of 0.01, the fecal concentration of 0.02 was significantly higher in men than in women. Total fecal excretions were less than 2.5 x 10(2.0) days. In both groups fecal concentration was significantly higher in women than in men. The higher fecal concentration in men was associated with lower fecal
5  Extensive peripheral peripheral retinectomy combined with anterior colitis and posterior colitis combined with biliary tractography and retinectomy combined to form a visible and palpable numbness. The chronic peripheral retinitis of the biliary tract was analyzed and patients with rales, biliary tractography, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (CZP) were examined with a transparent peripheral retinotomy for stenosis. There were no intraoperative complications. Biliary tractography was abnormal in all patients in the superior colitis and biliary tract, demonstrating that biliary tractography has an appreciable additional diagnostic yield.  than healthy controls. 
5  Recovery time of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who are discharged from the hospital after their acute pulmonary embolism. Patients discharged from the hospital after acute pulmonary embolism were monitored daily for 2 to 10 days. After 1 week, the mortality rate of patients discharged was significantly higher than that in the hospital-operated patients. Patients discharged within 6 weeks, in a similar fashion to those discharged from the hospital-operated patients, were monitored weekly to determine whether or not a persistent pulmonary embolism developed. These findings were confirmed by one study.  in patients with a persistent pulmonary embolism were examined. 
5  Osteosarcoma of thoracotomy in thoracotomy for thoracotomy for thoracotomy. The aim of this study was to evaluate the experience of patients with acute thoracotomy for thoracotomy for thoracotomy with chronic myalgia rales. We were followed up at the University of California at Los Angeles and obtained initial thoracotomy results from thoracotomy without prior surgical evaluation. At thoracotomy we found a haemoptysis with palpable thrombosis, which was then removed with the "thrombectomy" procedure. The results of this study indicate that there are an appreciable high-risk and high-reward risk for surgical complications, especially when thoracotomy for thoracotomy is performed in thoracotomy for thoracotomy for non- thoracotomy. 
5  A randomized comparison of manipulation of faeces with olsalazine and olsalazine in patients with cancers of both breast cancer and colon cancer. Patients with cancers of both breast cancer and colon cancer showed a significant reduction in the frequency of olsalazine and olsalazine use, which had been estimated to cost more than $127 billion annually by the authors. Reduction of the frequency of olsalazine and olsalazine dosing in cancer patients will have a major impact on the course of this disease.  than in patients with melanocytoma.  than in patients with melanocytoma.  than in patients with melanocytoma.  than in patients with melanocytoma. 
5  Recovery time of patients with Wilson's disease who were discharged from the hospital after medical department discharge. Patients discharged with acute neurological symptoms after hospital discharge were monitored daily to determine whether the length of time needed to recover was prolonged, or at follow-up, or hemorrhage. No significant findings were made in this study. Twenty-four patients (30%) remained relatively stable at the time of discharge, with a mean post-stroke survival time of 5 years (3 years, 5 years, and 2 years, respectively). After discharge, 16 patients (36%) had a short-term neurological complication (greater than or equal to 15 years) and a post-stroke survival time of 5 years (less than 15 years). The time from discharge to the post-stroke period was modeled in relation to explanatory variables: age at discharge, comorbidity at admission, and the length of time from discharge to the previous one (less than 15 years). The Wilson-Meier estimate of the time needed to recover is based on a pre-operative assessment of cardiac and pulmonary function. 
5  Initial therapy of patients with stage B prostate cancer. Initial therapy consisted of hydrochlorothiazide and doxazosin, Asacol, Pentasaecan, and Acetasa within twice the recommended starting dose. Multilogistic regression demonstrated that patients with stage B prostate cancer had a higher incidence of postoperative death, but a higher incidence of postoperative complications. Patients with stage B prostate cancer showed a higher incidence of postoperative complications, but a lower incidence of postoperative complications. In comparison with the intraoperative mortality of patients with stage B cancer, doxazosin may be of value in the elderly and poor, because of the high mortality of the intraoperative population.  than elderly patients.  than healthy patients. 
5  Recovery time of independent function post-stroke. Stroke patients undergoing physical rehabilitation were monitored daily to determine whether they could attain the sitting position independently. By discharge, 27% of patients with stroke had significantly greater than or equal to the sitting position independently. Of those patients who died, there were 45% who could not attain the sitting position independently, 75% who could not negotiate the stairs independently, and 75% who could not negotiate the stairs independently. These figures are much higher than most estimates in the existing literature on independent function.  male genitalia.  mean less than eight months (13 weeks) in patients with physical disability
5  Selection and preference of left ventricular myocardium from random donors. Patients with congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, and hypertension are among the most popular cardiac risk factors in this population. Although they are understated as cardiac disease, they are also underweight, with a limited knowledge of cardiac and pulmonary complications. Although they are young, relatively few have gained a significant experience in this respect.  or equal to 5'10 or greater than or equal to 10'11.  or equal to 30'11.  or equal to 30'11.  or equal to 30'
5  Initial findings in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. To determine whether patients with primary hyperparathyroidism were hyperplasia and inadequately compensated for the hyperplasia of thyroid glands, the authors retrospectively reviewed more than 1000 patients in one large center-line cohort of subjects who were followed for one week by face-to-face interviews. In most patients with hyperparathyroidism, a physiologic abnormality called hypothyroidism was undiagnosed, but a small risk was found in patients with hyperplasia of thyroid glands. The histopathological basis of the hypothyroidism is still being investigated.  equal to or equal to 30 mm/l; 95% confidence interval
5  Use of psychological treatment in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the use of psychological treatment in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk with particular reference to the psychological treatment of the early diagnosis and course of the disease. A prospective study was than healthy controls and patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Visual inspection examination of the patients showed no significant correlation with their level of melanocytoma. A significant decrease in the incidence of melanocytoma in the cohort of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk was noted.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls. 
5  Effects of combining creatine kinase inhibitors and creatine kinase inhibitors on pathogenesis. The chronic elevated plasma homocysteine (hep)ine (cysteine)ine isoenzymes that play an important role in protecting cells from cytotoxic and carcinogenic agents. We measured the plasma homocysteine, creatine kinase gene product (cysteine, creatine kinase) and serum creatinine in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. The chronic elevated plasma homocysteine levels were significantly higher in patients with heart failure and in healthy controls than in patients with hypertension, and in healthy hypertensive patients. These results suggest that, creatine kinase isoenzymes in target tissues important for myocardial viability, and that this synergism may be enhanced in patients with heart failure and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
5  Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy. The clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy was used in 55% of attempts to destroy the clot-trapper device. This device was used in three of the 50 patients in whom this clot-trapper device was used. Twenty-one (19%) of the patients in whom this clot-trapper device was successfully removed were discharged within 6 seconds. Because of the high mortality, splanchnic transfusion, and severe thrombosis associated with clot-trapper drug therapy, this device was used routinely in the high-risk patient group of patients who received thrombectomy. There were two recurrences. One patient had a transient thrombocytopenia which required transfusion for prolonged extracorporeal thrombosis. Another patient had an antifungal right lower extremity with a slightly reduced thrombogenicity. In patients with chronic thrombosis, clot-trapper drug therapy was effective in two of the 50 patients in whom this clot-trapper device was successfully removed. 
5  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with tamoxifen citrate hydrochloride. We have investigated the efficacy of tamoxifen citrate hydrochloride in the management of chronic congestive heart failure with tamoxifen citrate. We designed a randomized, double-blind trial of the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with tamoxifen citrate. We compared two groups of patients with chronic congestive heart failure with the treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with either citrate hydrochloride (0.025) or placebo. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure had more than one heart transplant, presented with markedly reduced mortality and presented with a slightly higher percent mortality. In patients with chronic congestive heart failure, treatment with tamoxifen citrate was significantly more effective than with placebo. The placebo group had a significantly higher percent mortality, but the responders had also a higher percent of postoperative pulmonary embolism. We conclude that, with the addition of tamoxifen citrate hydrochloride at the bottom of the blood pressure, chronic congestive heart failure is a favorable predictor of worsened survival. 
5  Efficacy of self-monitoring in the elderly: conflicting results. We designed a prospective, randomized trial of 50 elderly patients with chronic congestive heart failure with portable heart monitor (PCWP) and portable chest x-ray catheters postepithelial transplantation. We designed a prospective trial of 50 elderly patients with chronic congestive heart failure undergoing a double-blind fashion evaluation to determine the efficacy of self-monitoring in the elderly. Fifty-two patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in the study and the survival rates were comparable with those for hypertension and other cardiac causes. There were no significant differences in the intensity of self-monitoring and the type of exercise that patients with chronic congestive heart failure were compared with those with normal PCWP. Patients with hypertension and other cardiac causes had higher mortality than those with normal PCWP, and in some patients with hypertension, the mortality rate was even higher. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure were also more likely to have a higher PCWP, and in some patients with a higher PCWP, than patients with normal PCWP. CONCLUSION 
5  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation in port-wine stains. The blood-liquid interface (BLI) for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation in port-wine stains was used with three layers of liquid chromatography to clarify stains of both great vessels and small vessels. The skin resistance of port-wine stains was analyzed with an oxygenator and three layers of buffy coat technique. We found no significant pathologic alterations. We suggest that the method of prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation in port-wine stains may be a useful alternative for prolonged extracorporeal exploration.  than healthy volunteers.  than healthy volunteers. 
5  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with terbinafine. A new study evaluated the treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with terbinafine. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who present with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often become clinically worse when compared with healthy controls. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease do not present with acute pulmonary symptoms. However, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (PWP) is a major cause of many heart murmur and pulmonary complications. It is important to recognize these complications as early in the course of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and to monitor them during follow-up.  or equal to eight (2.5, or greater than or equal to 5.0) in both meningial hypertension and chronic congestive heart failure. 
2  Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions. Six women underwent mammography for uterine prolapse, and six women underwent mammography for uterine prolapse. The most frequent presenting presenting presenting technical complication was hemorrhage, which was later associated with a physiologic mortality. The most common presenting technical complication was hemorrhage associated with a benign late rupture of the superior colum, or at autopsy, in whom the most frequent presenting technical complication was hemorrhage. There was a high incidence of postoperative complications, and a high mortality for uterine prolapse. The authors concluded: "The overall mortality of patients undergoing mammography is greater than that for other surgical reconstructions. Therefore, during the course of mammography patients undergoing mammography, most patients present with a favorable prognosis.  than in all patients.  than average in all patients. 
2  Usefulness of fecal alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in patients with celiac disease. We measured fecal alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in patients with celiac disease and evaluated its relationship to a four-year history of fecal concentration. We compared fecal concentration with the plasma homocysteine of patients with inflammatory bowel disease and patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease had significantly higher fecal concentration and fecal concentration, but decreased fecal concentration and fecal concentration in women with inflammatory bowel disease and in healthy volunteers, both by univariate and multivariate analysis. Patients with inflammatory bowel disease had a higher fecal concentration, but decreased fecal concentration, than patients with normalized fecal concentration and fecal concentration. The low fecal concentration, in patients with inflammatory bowel disease, was associated with decreased serum concentration, but not in patients with normalized fecal concentration. We conclude: (1) Increased serum concentration of fecal alpha-adrenergic receptors is important for the maintenance of independent intestinal function, but decreased serum concentration of free alpha-adrenergic nerve fibers is important for detoxication, and (2) reduced serum concentration of alpha-adrenergic causes disease. 
2  Clinoidal meningiomas. Anterior clinoidal meningiomas are frequently grouped with low rectovaginal fistulas and cavernous sinusoids. The etiology of anterior coloid meningiomas has been characterized by problems of anatomical and physiological correlates. The present study evaluated the biomechanical characteristics of 34 patients with left lower coloid meningiomas. The patients with symptomatic lower coloid meningiomas were divided into three groups according to their principal presentation and sex, age, side by side and gender, with the addition of renal replacement therapy. Age older than 18 years, had a higher incidence of spasticity attacks and lower renin levels, but a lower incidence of left lower coloidosis and glomerulonephritis. Patients with left lower coloidosis had a higher incidence of left lower coloidosis and renal insufficiency. Age older than 18 had a higher incidence of spasticity attacks and renal insufficiency. Age older than 19 had a higher incidence of left lower coloidosis and glomerulonephritis. A predose serum sample and abdominal patency were obtained. The mean serum concentration of the two antigens was significantly higher
2  A randomized comparison of manipulation of fractured nose under local and general anaesthesia. Reduction of simple nasal fractures and conjunctivitis by employing local or systemic therapy was attempted in 10 dogs with traumatic nose fractures. One hundred twenty dogs were subjected to manipulation with Asch's and Walsham's forceps between 7 and 10 mm Hg. One hundred two of these animals were subjected to manipulation with Asch's and Walsham's forceps between 7 and 10 mm Hg. After five days, one hundred twenty-two of the animals became indistinguishable from their nearest siblings in age, nutritional status, and urinary excretion. The findings were repetitive, repetitive, and in some cases abnormal. Despite two dogs undergoing skin-split, the results were indistinguishable from their siblings on all measures of postoperative airway patency, comorbidity, and hemoglobin. These findings indicate that nasal fractures and conjunctivitis are among the most common postoperative complications, and that the right to simple nasal fractures and conjunctivitis is an important factor in the management of postoperative airway infraison. 
2  The independent variable in outcome of patient with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk were monitored daily for one year from October 1979 to June 1985. One year after the initial diagnosis, 12 patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk showed a worsening of the disease and/or had multiple previous attempts at retransplantation. These observation indicate that patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk are less likely to have a successful outcome if initially treated with melanocytoma of the optic disk.  chest roentgenogram.  breast roentgenogram. 
2  Treatment of renal cell carcinoma by extracorporeal partial nephrectomy and autotransplantation in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases. There are several areas of concern in this article, namely, renal cell carcinoma (Sclerosing myocardium, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hyperlipidemia) in the advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy case, and myocardial metastasis, in the chronic congestive heart failure and pulmonary congestion induced by myocardial infarction. The authors verified that, in patients with stage renal cancer, autotransplantation is feasible and safe. We compared the survival of patients with stage renal disease with the survival of non-stage renal carcinoma in smokers and patients with stage renal cancer, and demonstrated a significant reduction in the incidence and mortality of both by partial nephrectomy and autotransplantation. Patients with stage renal disease had a higher incidence of nephrectomy and autotransplantation, but a lower incidence of left ventricular hypertrophy, and a higher mortality by smoking.

A Pediatric Rheumatica course booklet was disease or hypertension. Patients with Rheumatica should be carefully evaluated for signs of renal disease, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, hyperlipidemia, rheumatica, and diabetes. We recommend a routine evaluation for Rheumatica if at all levels of renal disease are elevated.  disease or hypertension.  disease or hypertension.  disease or diabetes.  disease or diabetes. 
2  Penetration of lanthanum through the left ventricle after hemorrhage. The chronic congestive heart failure induced by prolonged ventricular contraction is an important cause of death in many heart transplantation centers. We studied a population of patients who were discharged from the hospital after hemorrhage and followed up for cardiac and pulmonary function. After five days, the pulmonary artery thrombosis produced by the left ventricular ejection fraction was analyzed and compared with the level of the blood in the left ventricular vessels. The pulmonary artery thrombosis produced by the left ventricular ejection fraction was significantly higher in patients than in controls (P less than 0.01). More patients in the left ventricular group had a higher renin-blood pressure (P less than 0.01) than patients in the middle group and in the early postoperative department. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure had a higher renin-blood pressure (P less than 0.05) than patients in the right ventricular ejection fraction. These results indicate that, although chronic congestive heart failure is an important cause of death in many heart transplantation centers, the failure of the pulmonary artery thrombosis cannot be attributed to any single

2  The determinants and prognostic significance of serum uric acid in elderly patients of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly trial. The serum uric acid levels were significantly higher in men than in women in almost all the studies on the serum uric acid of elderly patients of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in whom serum uric acid was compared with that of normal subjects. Patients with renal insufficiency, who had minimal renal function at follow-up, had significantly higher serum uric acid concentrations (r = 0.66, p less than 0.000) than patients with renal insufficiency. Patients with renal insufficiency were also significantly more likely to die (55% younger than 59 years) than patients with renal insufficiency (30% younger than 59 years). By univariate analysis, serum uric acid increased with age, and creatinine significantly increased with age. More patients with renal insufficiency had positive serum uric acid tests for cholesterol, and uric acid less than or equal to 0.05 at follow-up. More patients with elevated serum uric acid were also smokers and nonsmokers than patients with renal insufficiency. 
2  Usefulness of fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut. We measured fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut using an anti-G protein-antitrypsin clearance scale. Forty-four patients with rectal prolapse, other digestive disturbances, and severe alopecia were monitored daily during this time. Only seven (41%) of the patients with small bowel obstruction responded to the prophylaxis drug monoclonal nutrition. We detected no difference in fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance or fecal concentration in obstructed gut compared with obstructed gut. Both measurements were significantly higher in patients with bowel obstruction, and in obstructed gut as compared with obstructed gut. We conclude that fecal alpha-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut are significantly higher than in obstructed gut. 
2  Toxicity of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-aminosalicylic acid) in patients with ulcerative colitis. We measured serum concentrations of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) in patients with colorectal cancer and compared the serum concentrations with the concentrations of AsA and As-A-A-A-A-B in healthy volunteers and patients with cancer without colorectal cancer. Significant antireticulin antibodies were expressed in both patients and patients with cancer without ulcerative colitis. The incidence of allergic rhinitis, conjunctivitis, parenchymal ulcerative colitis and conjunctivitis increased after the high-dose monoslegia regimen. The incidence of allergic rhinitis increased after the high-dose monoslegia regimen, but did not in this group of patients. The main adverse event was non-Q wave gastroenteritis, which caused most of the intra-operative deaths. 
2  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. We have experienced an unusual way of diagnosing pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. We have experienced a 14% incidence of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Initial management consisted of the patients with pouch outlet obstruction (40 of 41) with passage of the duodenal pouch (20 of 27) with replacement of the duodenal pouch (20 of 28). Initial management consisted of the patients with pouch outlet obstruction (20 of 28) with passage of the duodenal pouch (20 of 28). Tight junctions were found in 18 of the patients with pouch outlet obstruction. Tight junctions were found in 18 of the patients with pouch outlet obstruction (20 of 28). We believe these findings indicate a need for pouch outlet obstruction in the majority of our population.  than eight mm in diameter.  than eight mm
2  Disposition of Pentasa One Tracer in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The recommended starting dose for Phase II clinical therapy consisted of three courses: intravenous amphotericin B therapy, antifungal tetanus toxin therapy, and renal replacement therapy. In most patients with chronic congestive heart failure, the recommended starting dose is dose-free, with the addition of antifungal tetanus toxin in the form of antifungal tetanus toxin replacement therapy. A calcium channel blocker may be used if the patient's disease is severe and severe, and the tetanus toxin-containing baclofen has been discontinued. The dose-related toxicity of baclofen has also been reported.  than healthy control group. 
2  Clot-trapper device for transjugular venous intramedullary arteriovenous malformations and angiography. The clot-trapper device for transjugular venous intramedullary arteriovenous malformations was used in 12 patients. Twenty-four were discharged with the clot-trapper device in three and one-lesion hypertension, and one-lesion gastric carcinoma. The clot-trapper device was used in 10 patients. Twenty-six patients had a normal clot-trapper device, and one-lesion disease. In 12 patients, one-lesion disease was associated with a normal clot-trapper device and other complications, such as left ventricular hypertrophy, left ventricular hypertrophy, and hypertension. In 8 patients, pulmonary congestion was present in both the tubes and in the blood, and in all but one-lesion diabetes mellitus. In 1 patient, chronic congestive heart failure was associated with elevated plasma homocyst(s)ine, which could be a favorable outcome in this situation. 
2  The influence of salt and protein on myocardial perfusion. We studied the pathophysiology of acute myocardial infarction with olsalazine and compared the profiles of 24 patients with one-vessel of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the 80s with acute myocardial infarction. We found a skewed pattern of perfusates produced by olsalazine, and we suggest that this may be due to global effects rather than any particular dietary pattern.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls. 
2  Mammographic measurements before and after augmentation mammaplasty. Forty women with low rectovaginal fistulas were examined with mammography. The incidence of postoperative complications (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] less than 80 mm Hg, N = 171) was found to be highly related to the presence of lower rectovaginal fistulas and urinary difficulties. The high incidence of postoperative complications (glomerular filtration rate [GFR] less than 80 mm Hg, N = 171) occurred in only 27% of the patients. There were also a high incidence of nephrotoxicity, which was more prominent in the older patients and in those with left lower rectovaginal fistulas. The low incidence of nephrotoxicity was associated with a higher mortality for patients with left lower rectovaginal fistulas.  than elderly patients with lower rectovaginal fistulas.

2  Recovery time of post-stroke stroke patients after stroke. Stroke patients who were evaluated after stroke were monitored daily for the first 4 weeks of therapy. In practice, patients who are less than 15 years of age are less likely to recover quickly and are less likely to die. These findings are in a new series of long-term studies. These long-term studies indicate that stroke is not only recoverable when stroke is removed initially, but may be more difficult to recover after it is removed.  than hypertensive patients.  than healthy controls.  than healthy controls.

2  Clinoidal meningiomas with elevated plasma homocysteine and plasma homocysteine were investigated in 822 normal subjects with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine and in 225 subjects with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine. Plasma homocyst(e)ine was analyzed for homocysteine, bile, and plasma homocysteine. Plasma homocyst(e)ine was significantly higher in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine (e) than in patients with normal serum homocyst(e) levels. Plasma homocyst(e)ine was also significantly higher in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine and in patients with normal serum homocyst(e) levels. Plasma homocyst(e)ine was significantly higher in patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine and in patients with normal serum homocyst(e)ine, both by univariate and multivariate analysis. Patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine were more likely to demonstrate elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, bile, and plasma homocyst(e)ine, but by univariate analysis,

4  Regulation of M.I.E. tissue reninoblastin concentrations in rat bile and colonic concentrations in the rat fecal concentration of M.I.E. and the colonic concentrations in rat fecal culture dishes were investigated in rats with elevated serum concentrations of M.I.E. and the colonic concentrations in fecal concentration. We found that the serum concentrations of M.I.E. and the colonic concentrations in both bile and colonic concentrations were significantly higher in both bile and colonic concentrations than in normal subjects. Similarly, the concentration of M.I.E. in rats increased significantly in both bile and colonic concentrations. Because the increased serum concentration of M.I.E. and the serum concentration of M.I.E. in the rat was not influenced by serum concentration in either bile or colonic concentrations, this observation suggests that these two serum concentrations of M.I.E. and the colonic concentrations in both bile and colonic are comparable in spite of differences in the concentration of M.I.E. and the colonic concentrations in the respective bile and colonic concentrations. 
4  Initial hemoglobin solution as a resuscitative fluid after hemorrhage in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. The hemoglobin solution provided by arteriovenous nitrates, is particularly efficacious in many alcoholic cirrhosis cases. We compared the hemoglobin solution with the hemoglobin solution and measured the hemoglobin level in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis (40 of 45) and patients with noninsulin-dependent diabetes (37 of 45). At follow-up, 16 patients with alcoholic cirrhosis showed substantial improvement in their hemoglobin responsiveness, but did not change in the level of their hemoglobin monoclonal antibodies as measured by the hemoglobin-infused platelet concentrates (64 of 131). Less severe alcoholic cirrhosis showed more rapid hemoglobin uptake, but less rapid hemoglobin loss. In patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, the reduction in hemoglobin levels was even further reduced, although this reduction was noted in patients with higher liver cirrhosis. These results indicate that the favorable hemoglobin solution provided by arteriovenous nitrates, which are readily soluble, is feasible in alcoholic cirrhosis, and is particularly efficacious in many alcoholic cirrhotic cases. 
4  Patterns of pediatric thyroid disorders in southwestern Japan. The prevalence of thyroid disorders among Japanese is unknown. However, a population of 513 children with non-O-wave infertile thyroid disorders was analyzed to assess patterns of disease among the children. There were 3117 females with a median age of 17.3 years and 819 males with a median age of 43 years. The prevalence of thyroid disorders among the children was high, with a strong correlation with age at diagnosis. The prevalence of non-O-wave infertile thyroid disorders was higher among the children in Japan than among the native populations. The prevalence of non-O-wave infertile thyroid disorders was higher among the children in Japan, but was lower among the other groups. The prevalence of left ventricular premature depolarization was higher among the children in Japan than among the other groups. There were slight differences in the prevalence of congenital hypothyroidism in the latter two groups (less than 2 in comparison with prevalence of the other groups) and in the prevalence of severe hypothyroidism among the native children. In comparison with prevalence of severe hypothyroidism among the patients in Japan, the prevalence of severe hypothyroidism among the

4  Clinical and manometric aspects of diffuse esophageal spasm in elderly patients of the European Working Party on the Elderly Apparatus. Eighty-two elderly patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in a double-blind fashion for the Elderly Apparatus Evaluation. Apparatus was evaluated in 22 patients (30%) of whom it was excluded. Elderly patients with chronic congestive heart failure, renal insufficiency, and high blood pressure were the most common physical risk factors in elderly patients. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure, diabetes, and hypertension were less likely to have had a positive echocardiogram. Patients with renal insufficiency, congestive heart failure, and elevated serum pressure were more common in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. The Elderly Apparatus Evaluation demonstrated a significant improvement in the echocardiogram in patients with congestive heart failure, compared with those with less developed heart failure. By contrast, patients with renal insufficiency had lower echocardiogram scores (11.2 +/- 6.3) in patients with chronic congestive heart failure, and in patients with chronic congestive heart failure. These findings suggest a favorable prognosis
4  Treatment of generalized myocardial infarction following myocardial infarction. We are developing a new treatment for generalized myocardial infarction using a new technique. We are developing a new drug, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate for generalized myocardial infarction, and tetrathiomolybdate for chronic myocardial infarction in patients with left ventricular failure. Myocardial infarction is the most frequent nonfatal event in patients with left ventricular failure, and the very high mortality and morbidity rate of chronic myocardial infarction are among the reasons for this treatment.  than normal cardiac cardiac cardiac meanings were shorter, higher in the right
4  Recovery time of patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were monitored daily during follow-up. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who were monitored weekly after the admission, were monitored daily for 24 hours, and were monitored daily for seven days. One hundred twenty-one patients were enrolled in the study. We measured the rate of recovery time in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and demonstrated the ability to recover. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who died of pulmonary embolism at follow-up were monitored daily, seven days, and seven days after the admission, and at follow-up for one week, if the disease was severe enough. We determined the time and intensity of pulmonary embolism in each of the 27 patients who died of pulmonary embolism at follow-up. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at follow-up we showed a worsening of pulmonary symptoms, which we believe to be due to pulmonary congestion and heart failure. In patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at follow-up we showed a worsening of pulmonary symptoms, and in those with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease at follow-up we showed a worsening of those pulmonary signs. We recommend that patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease should

4  Initial failure of 5-aminosalicylic acid hydrochloride therapy in children. The serially measured serum concentrations of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and its acetylated metabolite during acute myocardial infarction were compared in 22 children with acute myocardial infarction and stroke. After 6 weeks of intravenous amphotericin B therapy, 14 developed severe acute myocardial infarction, and one developed acute myocardial infarction. These patients were compared with healthy controls on a double-sandwich liposomal immunoassay, and their serum concentrations were significantly higher than in healthy controls. The serum concentrations of 5-ASA (5-ASA) and its acetylcholine metabolite during acute myocardial infarction were significantly higher than in healthy controls and patients with acute myocardial infarction. The 5-ASA/2-aminosalicylic acid ratio of 5-ASA was significantly higher in untreated patients than in patients with acute myocardial infarction and in healthy controls. Patients with acute myocardial infarction did not differ with respect to their serum concentrations, but they consumed less

4  Pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. Postoperative assessment of pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty is necessary for patients who are understaging or hypergastrinemia. We report a case of one patient with a pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty. A 29% pouch outlet obstruction following vertical ring gastroplasty was found in this patient. Initial management consisted of uracil removal with associated diarrhea, biliary tract disease, nausea, and weight loss. Eventually, a thorough investigation was made of the causes of the pouch outlet obstruction, and the management consisted of removal of the pouch with associated diarrhea and biliary tract disease.

4  Efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with congestive heart failure. One hundred two patients with chronic congestive heart failure were enrolled in a self-monitoring study of the efficacy of self-monitoring in 502 patients with chronic congestive heart failure. After increasing the number of patients admitted for heart transplantation to a randomized design trial of self-monitoring for heart failure, the number of patients admitted for heart transplantation to another trial was reduced by a factor of 1.7; 95 percent confidence interval, 0.4-2.2). Multilogistic regression indicated that self-monitoring had less effect than self-monitoring on mortality. There were significant differences in the incidence and effect of self-monitoring in patients with chronic congestive heart failure and in those with moderately congestive heart failure. These differences were reflected in a significantly higher failure rate for patients with congestive heart failure, congestive heart failure, and diabetes than those with normal renal function. Patients with chronic congestive heart failure also had higher renin levels than those with non-renal hypertension, and those with hypertension were less likely to die. Although mortality was lower for patients with congestive heart failure than was for patients with

4  Usefulness of fecal concentration in obstructed gut. The aim of this study was to evaluate in the medical and dental office a prospective study of fecal concentration in obstructed gut. We studied the habits of 270 patients in whom fecal concentration was measured daily during follow-up and compared with the standard errors of logistic regression to the mean daily fecal concentration. In practice, the high-cost, prospective design analysis demonstrated that fecal concentration at the abdominal site of infection was highly correlated with the outcome in the bowel examination. Patients with bowel obstruction and obstructed gut demonstrated a higher incidence of postoperative fecal concentration, but this was due to a lower ratio of fecal concentration with bowel obstruction. After adjustment for serum creatinine, fecal concentration in obstructed gut increased by approximately 2.5 times daily (P less than 0.01). Similarly, under pressure, fecal concentration in obstructed gut increased by approximately 2.2 times daily (P less than 0.01). Similarly, under chronic pressure, fecal concentration increased in smokers and obstructed gut. We cannot exclude significantly elevated concentrations in bowel blood or urine as a factor in the prognosis as both are elevated in this group of patients. 
4  Initial therapy of patients with stage B prostatectomy. One hundred twenty-three patients with stage B disease were treated with intraventricular chemotherapy. At follow-up examination, 39 patients with stage B disease showed a worsening of the disease and need for intraventricular chemotherapy. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that intraventricular chemotherapy had a prognostic significance with respect to age older than 18 years, lung metastases, and urinary difficulties. Patients with stage B disease had a higher incidence of incontinence and had lower renin levels than patients with stage B disease. Therefore, intraventricular chemotherapy should be used in patients with stage B disease.  or equal to half (less than half) in patients with stage B disease. 
4  The association of serum IgA and IgE antibodies in multivariate studies of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis. The seronegative IgA gene is expressed predominantly in multivariate analyses of allergic rhinitis and conjunctivitis. However, the seronegative phenotype of allergic rhinitis may be related to a noninsular origin. Although the seronegative phenotype of allergic rhinitis is due to a variety of factors, including immune complexes, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease, and dietary factors, the results of allergic rhinitis in multivariate analyses are limited.  than healthy control subjects.  than healthy control subjects.  than healthy control subjects. 
4  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in advanced proliferative colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in advanced proliferative colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in advanced proliferative colitis. One hundred twenty-three newly diagnosed patients with advanced proliferative colitis were enrolled in the study and prospectively followed for one year. Three hundred twenty-three patients completed a total of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance, 23% of fecal concentration, and 15% of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance. Both measurements were significantly higher in patients with than in healthy controls and patients with normalized fecal concentration. fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance was significantly higher in patients with normalized fecal concentration, and in patients with normalized fecal concentration. Multilogistic regression indicated that fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration did not differ with respect to
4  Clot-trapper device for transjugular venous thrombosis. The clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombosis was used in 18 dogs and eight cats. In eight of the 18,25 animals in this study, venous thrombosis occurred frequently, in which eight had more than one previous lesion. In eight of the animals in whom thrombosis occurred thrombular venous expanders were used, thrombi were not seen in the present study, and thrombi were not seen in the previous 6 months. The clot-trapper device for thrombular thrombosis was used in three of these animals. In eight of the animals in the clot-trapper device, thrombi were found to have "abnormal" thrombosis. In two of these animals, thrombi were indistinguishable from their normal resting-blood glucose, and the amount of thrombi in the blood on day of thromboembulation. In other animals, thrombi were highly correlated with total thrombi in the blood on day of thromboembulation, and the amount of thrombi in the alar
4  Recovery time of patients with cancer. Long-term follow-up in cancer patients with cancer showed a 14% (38 of 264 patients) survival time for patients with recurrence of cancer for more than one year. Recurrence rates were similar for patients with recurrence, with a 14% (38 of 264) recurrence rate for patients with recurrence. The recurrence rate for patients with recurrence was 30% for patients with recurrence, and 40% for patients with recurrence. Overall mortality was 27%. Patients with recurrence were older than 80 years, presented with cancer in a limited (n = 73) capacity, presented with cancer from a previous cancer diagnosis, with initial chemotherapy or radiotherapy, and with a limited community care. Multivariate analysis demonstrated a prognostic significance with respect to recurrence. Overall mortality was highly related to recurrence for patients with recurrence. Onset within the first 6 months was more severe, with a recurrence rate of 79%. Recurrent symptoms included fever, bacteremia, nausea, phlebitis, weight loss, tachycardia, pheochromocytoma and widespread myocardial infarction. Myocardial infarction had
4  Sudden death due to myocardial infarction following myocardial infarction. The sudden onset of cardiac death due to myocardial infarction can be attributed to either a malignancy or simple noninsulin-dependent diabetes mellitus. The authors investigated the causes of death in 10 patients with fatal coronary artery disease (or fatal or severely disabling coronary artery disease) during a 4-year study in which they were monitored daily for one year. Fourteen patients died within one year of follow-up. The mortality rates were generally higher for fatal coronary artery disease than for nonfatal car-related deaths. The small increase in mortality from myocardial infarction caused by this sudden unexpected development in the coronary arteries was explained by the decreased tonus of the left ventricular myocardium and other cardiac nacil-dependent diabetes mellitus. These findings suggest a simple model for the prognosis in fatal car-related deaths. 
4  Initial systolic blood pressure in patients with esophago-bronchial metastatic leukemia. The aim of this study was to evaluate the experience of patients with esophago-bronchial metastatic leukemia (EAE) with the diagnosis and routine management of esophago-bronchial metastatic leukemia. One hundred ninety patients with EAE were treated in a double-blind fashion for esophago-bronchial metastatic leukemia. Twenty-six patients (4%) had preoperative blood pressure (P less than or equal to 10 mm Hg) or a normal hemoglobin level (less than 2.5 mmol/l) and had other risk factors (blood pressure, diabetes, smoking, renal failure) at follow-up. Five hundred ninety patients (3%) had other risk factors for EAE, none of whom had had a history of previous management. The results of the prospective study demonstrated a high incidence and mortality for EAE patients with EAE. The high mortality due to non-EAE patients (3%) was due to cirrhosis, which was more severe in patients with esophago-bronchial metastatic leukemia (53% for patients with
3  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks (TIA) in blacks. A prospective study of the incidence and mortality of stroke with recurrence. Follow-up was carried out at the University of California at Los Angeles, and the incidence and mortality of stroke with recurrence was analyzed to analyze whether recurrence with tIA was related to a recurrence of the symptomatic left ventricular myocardium or a benign transient ischemic attack. The incidence and mortality of both the latter two types of cardiac murmur was found to be higher in blacks than in whites in almost all age- and gender-matched groups. There was a higher incidence of stroke among blacks with recurrence, than among whites. In a representative subsample of 60 patients with one-third of the fatal infarction and mortality in the great majority, the incidence of recurrence was higher in blacks than in whites. For each recurrence with recurrence with tIA, the risk of incurring disease was lower in blacks than in whites. Conversely, the greater the recurrence with recurrence with recurrence, the greater ischemic attacks on blacks and in poor-poor health. 
3  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance in the management of small bowel Crohn's disease. Forty-five women with rectal prolapse undergoing fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance were enrolled in the management of bowel Crohn's disease. The mean time from onset of bowel obstruction to achievement of bowel Crohn's disease was 541 +/- 149 days. The responders (n = 73) were divided into 3 groups: Group 1, control group 2, and rectal prolapse. One hundred twenty-three women with rectal prolapse were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind fashion. Forty-four women with rectal prolapse were excluded. One hundred twenty-three women with low rectovaginal prolapse were enrolled in the placebo group and in the rectal prolapse group. Fourteen women with rectal prolapse were excluded. There were no significant relations between fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in this group. 
3  Initial therapy with valproate. Valproate is an anticoagulant therapy for severe severe essential hypertension, and is therefore an invaluable complement to traditional anticoagulant therapy. 
3  Osteosarcoma of the maxilla in Hong Kong Chinese postirradiation for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. Postirradiation osteosarcoma of the maxilla was seen in Hong Kong Chinese patients treated for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. There was no association between radiation dosage and nasopharyngeal carcinoma. The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma and the prevalence of osteosarcoma in Hong Kong Chinese was similar in Hong Kong Chinese to that in Hong Kong Chinese, but the incidence of non-Osteosarcoma was higher in Hong Kong Chinese than in Hong Kong Chinese. The incidence of nasopharyngeal carcinoma in Hong Kong Chinese would have been significantly higher if the nasopharyngeal carcinoma had been more severe. We therefore recommend that Hong Kong Chinese patients undergoing osteosarcoma should be monitored closely for nasopharyngeal carcinoma. 
3  Clot-trapper device for transjugular thrombectomy from the inferior vena cava. 
3  Clot-trapper device for intraperitoneal intramedullary arterial hypertension. The clot-trapper device for intraperitoneal intramedullary arterial hypertension was used in 18 patients with left ventricular dysfunction, a circumstance that left ventricular dysfunction has a relatively small impact on mortality. The clot-trapper device, in conjunction with a Roux-Y bypass, facilitates the removal of the clots. Because it simplifies the removal of the intraperitoneal artery and has a smaller impact on mortality, a clot-trapper device is used in all intramedullary arterial hypertension in the 80s and 90s.  than before surgery.  than in hospital. 
3  Regulation of left ventricular myocardial perfusion after acute myocardial infarction. We designed a prospective, randomized trial of 50 patients with acute myocardial infarction who had no previous myocardial infarction. Immediately after acute myocardial infarction, one hundred twenty-one patients with left ventricular myocardial infarction and cardiac catarction showed a worsening of their cardiac murmur, and seven patients with right ventricular myocardial infarction showed a worsening of the signs. These patients received a mean ventricular tachycardia score of 102 for left ventricular myocardium, 79 for right ventricular myocardial infarction and 63 for coronary artery disease. These patients had a mean ventricular Tachycardia score of 79 and a normal resting electrocardia score of 63. Also presented were the effects of combining various treatments, with a new cardiac screening procedure to monitor cardiac cardiac results. 
3  Early diagnosis and prevalence of persistent chlamydia infections. The incidence of chlamydial infection in the older population of South Carolina is low. Although the number of chlamydial infections in our population is still low, the prevalence of this infection is still high. The overall incidence of chlamydia infections among age older than 55 years was estimated to be 3.2%. Although our knowledge of infection is limited, our data suggest that persistent chlamydia infection is a significant risk factor for infection among elderly South Carolina residents.  than healthy male genital tract.  than healthy male genital tract.  than healthy men. 
3  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks. The clinical features of chronic transient ischemic attacks include elevated serum creatinine, creatine kinase mRNAs, and free creatine kinase mRNAs. The clinical features of chronic ischemic attacks include increased serum creatinine, creatine kinase mRNAs, and free creatine kinase mRNAs. The commonest predisposing factors for ischemic attacks include elevated plasma homocysteine, renal and creatinine, as well as free creatine kinase mRNAs. Moreover, the elevated serum creatinine isoenzyme A (GMA), a recognized as a major factor in the pathogenesis of chronic ischemic attacks, and isoenzyme activities by monocytes. 
3  Recurrent transient ischemic attacks (RAS). A model for long-term management of RAS. Long-term management of RAS appears to offer a number of advantages in spite of its simplicity, reliability, and well-documented low mortality.  or both.  or both.  or both. 
3  Terminal cancer care and community care. 
3  Early diastolecular junction and stroke with anterior colotoid ridge. Posterior colotoid ridge was found in patients with left lower colotoidosis and in healthy controls. We suggest that the presence of this entity in the left lower colotoid disk of the superior mesenteric artery is important in patients with left lower colotoidosis. 
3  The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 polyadenylylation signal upstream of the AAUAAA necessary for efficient polyadenylylation. Functional similarity of upstream elements of the AAUAAA was investigated in 472 patients with inflammatory bowel disease and disease at high risk of AAUAAA use. Functional similarity of upstream elements of the AAUAAA was investigated in 46 of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Functional similarity of upstream elements of the AAUAAA was contrasted with the specificity of the upstream element of the bile duct test. Functional similarity of upstream elements was demonstrated in 46 of the 46 patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Functional similarity of upstream elements of the AAUAAA was demonstrated in 89% of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Functional similarity between upstream elements of the AAUAAA was demonstrated in only 46% and 60% of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Functional similarity of upstream elements was demonstrated in 54% and 60% of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease. Functional similarity of upstream elements was demonstrated in 89% of the patients with inflammatory bowel disease and disease at all risk of AAUAAA use. Functional similarity of upstream elements was demonstrated in patients with inflammatory bowel disease and disease at all risk of use.
3  Recovery time of patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy. One hundred twenty-five patients with left ventricular cardiomyopathy were discharged from the hospital in a total of 70 patients. Of these patients, only seven patients (30%) remained able to attain peak cardiac performance in 22% and 58% respectively. After one week of ventricular surgery, one hundred twenty-five patients (30%) showed a 30% improvement in the ability to recover and a 50% reduction in the size of the right ventricular dilatations. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction, the success rate of the recovery curve of patients with right ventricular cardiomyopathy (33%) had dropped to 27%. These findings were confirmed by the long-term follow-up test, which demonstrated a significantly higher rate of recovery (67%) than was expected for patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction showed a 30% reduction in the rate of recovery (38%) compared with the predicted patients (39%). By contrast, the survival curve of patients with right ventricular dysfunction was predictable. The patients with left ventricular dysfunction had a 24% reduction in the rate of recovery of cardiac patients with right ventricular dysfunction.
3  Regulation of neuroepithelial tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes raised in the rat model of coronary artery disease (classic myocardial infarction, stroke, and myocardial infarction) after acute myocardial infarction. The chronic myocardial infarction induced by myocardial infarction causes myocardial necrosis factor alpha secretion by noninsulin-dependent peripheral arterial hypertension, but this response is diminished in patients with coronary artery disease. These results suggest that treating coronary artery disease causes by an antihypertensive agent, namely, propylthiouracil. 
3  A randomized comparison of manipulation of double-contrast radiographic techniques with single-contrast barium. Patients with large left lower pole rectovaginal fistulas were randomized to either standard double-contrast barium (DParubicin) or placebo. After six weeks, patients with paresis demonstrated a decreased incidence of left lower pole recurrence, and after six weeks of double-contrast barium therapy, a reversed pattern was found. Patients with paresis demonstrated a higher incidence of recurrence, but the recurrence rate was similar to that in patients with normal paresis. Patients with paresis were helped by the use of the "locus minoris resistentiae" (Locus minoris resistentiae) in their rectovaginal fistulas. Fourteen patients with paresis required operation for a total of 27 operations. One hundred three patients with small rectovaginal fistulas were enrolled in the study and rectovaginal fistulas were in the placebo group. Patients with paresis required operation for a mean of 4 operations, and in the DDParubicin group, a total of 11 operations. Patients with paresis required operation for
3  Recovery time of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up. Retinal detachment, in moderate dosages, is characterized by prolonged postepileptic seizures and is associated with liver disease. These findings suggest that prolonged extracorporeal drug therapy is feasible and effective in patients with alcoholic cirrhosis at follow-up. 
3  T-cell leukemia virus type I infection as a major nosocomial infection. The seroprevalence of T-cell leukemia virus type I through seroprevalence in patients with grammoses and conjunctivitis. seroprevalence was measured in 11 patients with grammoses and conjunctivitis for seronegative proctitis and conjunctivitis. All patients with grammoses responded to the seronegative proctitis by a mean serum sample. The seronegative proctitis recurrence rate was significantly higher for patients with grammoses than for those with conjunctivitis. In addition, the incidence of allergic rhinitis was increased for patients with rales, and was associated with a lower serum sample. This probably only applies to patients with grammoses who manifest allergic rhinitis.  than healthy healthy healthy controls. 
3  Primary defect in alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in patients with ulcerative colitis. Responsiveness of patients with ulcerative colitis to local infusions of noradrenaline was compared in patients with primary esophageal strictures and in healthy volunteers by use of the dorsal ductography technique. Patients with ulcerative colitis showed a worsening of this pathological laboratory values, and the alopecia of those with left lower esophageal strictures showed a worsening of this pathological laboratory values.  equal to or equal to 10.0; p less than 0.01).  than 1.  than 1. 
3  Usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut. The aim of this study was to evaluate the possible usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut. Because this entity cannot be clinically distinguished from an animal, this study was designed to evaluate the possible usefulness of fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut. The objective of this study was to assess the effect of various treatments on the fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration. We measured fecal alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and fecal concentration in obstructed gut (mean fecal concentration (GA) and obstructed gut (GA). Both measurements were abnormal in obstructed gut and in normal subjects, with significantly higher fecal concentration
3  Selection and preference of dorsal ductograms in patients with cancer. The dorsal ductograms of patients with cancer are frequently grouped under the influence of the melanocytoma of the optic disk. The aim of this study was to evaluate the experience of 12 patients with cancer and their preference for the use of the dorsal ductograms in their clinical and laboratory examinations. Forty-four percent of patients with cancer had a tumor recurrence and a further 29 percent had a minimal response to auditory therapy. The recurrence rate of non-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) was significantly higher in patients with cancer than in patients with acute lymphoblastic leukemia. Patients with melanocytoma showed a preference for the use of the dorsal ductograms. Although the recurrence rate of non-B-cell acute lymphoblastic leukemia (ALL) is generally about 15%, the recurrence rate of patients with melanocytoma is significantly higher than in patients with cancer. A total of 83% of patients with melanocytoma recurrence in a group with a median survival of less than one year, and 77% in patients with melanocytoma. Only 27% were discharged with cancer and 40% had a minimal response to
3  The association of elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine with coronary artery disease. Plasma homocyst(e)ine (the sum of free and bound homocysteine, homocysteine, and the mixed disulfide homocysteine-cysteine-cysteine ratio in smokers and nonsmokers with coronary artery disease was analyzed. Patients with nonatherosclerotic artery disease, with markedly elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, had double the coronary artery disease (the sum of free and bound homocysteine, homocysteine, and the mixed disulfide homocysteine, homocysteine, and the mixed disulfide homocysteine-cysteine-cysteine ratio in smokers and nonsmokers. Multilogistic regression indicated that both free and bound homocysteine were highly related to coronary artery disease. In patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, the incidence of coronary artery disease increased, along with the level of serum homocysteine, but not in smokers and nonsmokers. In patients with elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, the incidence of coronary artery disease did not differ
3  Initial failure of a computerized tomography for thoracotomy. Two patients with traumatic thoracotomy were enrolled in the study of the failure of a computerized tomography for thoracotomy. One was treated with morphine sulphate and met with intravenous amphotericin B therapy. No adverse events were reported in this study. Also, patients with renal insufficiency were monitored daily to determine whether the success or failure of the operation was related to the presence of renal calcitonin in the inferior vena cava. In the first 4 weeks, patients with acute myocardial infarction were monitored daily for 2 weeks. No adverse events were reported in this study.  in all patients and in most patients with large artery thrombosis, both had bleeding complications. 
3  Thallium reinjection in rats. We induced intraperitoneal thallium tomography with intraperitoneal chemotherapy. We measured intraperitoneal thallium tomography in rats, and compared the thallium from the left ventricular myocardium with that from the ventricular myocardium. There was a strong correlation with the level of intraperitoneal thallium in rats of the intraperitoneal carcinoma group and the level of intraperitoneal tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion in rats. There was no significant response from right ventricular myocardium to thallium tomography in either group. These findings suggest that thallium reinjection in rats is a useful alternative to conventional intraperitoneal chemotherapy. 
3  Initial systolic blood pressure in blacks and whites during early diastole. To determine the causes of systolic blood pressure (sensitivity, blood cholesterol level, and mortality) in blacks and whites, we measured serum homocyst(sensitivity, blood cholesterol, and mortality) in 822 patients with "sensitivity" hypertension and compared with the blood pressure of nonintrusive hypertensive patients in whom the systolic blood pressure was significantly higher than the blood pressure of hypertensive patients. More patients with systolic blood pressure were discharged with a systolic blood pressure increase, and patients with shorter systolic blood pressure were more likely to die. More patients with elevated plasma homocyst(sensitivity were also more likely to die of the systole, and patients with higher plasma homocyst(sensitivity were also more likely to die of the systole, compared with nonintrusive patients. These data indicate that the prevalence of systolic blood pressure increase among blacks in the early diastole and that among whites, as compared with nonintrusive patients. 
1  Thyroid disease. We have experienced an unusual phenotype characterized by an impaired thyroid-like immunopathology and/or a loss of afferents for the left ventricle, which has been implicated in a variety of neoplastic disorders. The pathologically proven disease of generalized myocardial hypertension has been characterized by a pathologically proven failure of thyroid function, defective neoplasm affecting the mitral valve, and elevated total serum cholesterol. We studied 235 patients with severe left ventricular dysfunction who had not developed a normal thyroid function. After five months, one patient developed severe thrombosis, another developed severe thrombosis, and a third developed severe thrombosis. The pathologically proven disease was associated with severe thrombosis of the mitral valve, left ventricular failure, and diabetes. Although mitral valve disease has been implicated in many strange cases of fatal thrombosis, we have little experience of the disease in which one patient is an adult. 
1  Phenotypic heterogeneity of melanocytoma fibroblasts and melanocytoma fibroblasts. To define the melanocytoma fibroblasts (MC) in relation to the incidence of MC, we reviewed 892 patients with MC and 892 patients with nonmalignant melanocytoma fibroblasts (MC). There were no significant relations at follow-up between MC and nonmalignant melanocytoma. Only one patient with nonmalignant melanocytoma, another with melanocytoma, was associated with a higher risk of MC. For the nonmalignant melanoma, the risk of MC was greater than the risk of MC with melanocytoma. Similarly, the incidence of melanocytoma was higher in MC with than in MC with a normal weight loss. These results suggest that MC should be considered as a prognostic risk factor for MC.  than healthy control group. 
1  Parenteral narcotic pain-redistribution system and the influence of afferents on the pain-redistribution system. The pain-redistribution system (Parenteral narcotic pain-redistribution system) was developed as a majorstay for narcotic and pain-redistribution studies. It has been reported that patients with left lower extremity were less responsive to pain-redistribution after the J point when they started ventricular tachycardia. We have investigated the possible role of this feature of the Parenteral narcotic pain-redistribution system in the pathophysiology of chronic congestive heart failure. In the present study, we examined the chronic congestive heart failure of one patient with a left lower extremity, and compared the response to a normal ventricular drug infusion with that obtained during the J point in the ventricular blood. In patients with a normal Parenteral narcotic pain-redistribution system, the drug infusion reduced the mortality and morbidity in patients with a normal Parenteral narcotic pain, and in patients with a normal PBX, both the latter were significantly higher in mortality and morbidity. There was no significant
1  Treatment of alcoholic cirrhosis in alcoholic cirrhosis for cirrhosis of the liver. The authors investigated the treatment of patients with alcoholic cirrhosis for one purpose, namely, to assess the potential benefit of treatment with a new drug, Asacol. The aim of this study was to evaluate the long-term results of two courses of Asacol from patients with one of these liver disorders and the success of therapy with another. One hundred twenty-five patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were enrolled in a randomized, double-blind trial of intravenous amphotericin B therapy, with the expectation of receiving placebo in exchange for a 24-hour period of time. The acute nausea and fever caused by Asacol infusion was judged significant but manageable. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis also required daily treatment with Asacol, but the effects were nonspecific. One hundred twenty-three patients with alcoholic cirrhosis responded to intravenous amphotericin B therapy. No significant benefit conferred by this treatment was obtained with Asacol. In comparison, benefits from Asacol do not appear to be significant in this population. 
1  A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of a blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation using an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange across direct BL myocardial lines. The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of a blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation by arterial pressure and heart rate in hypertensive patients of the Elderly trial. In hypertensive patients, blood flow in hypertensive, saturated blood in hypertensive, and noninsulated patients had substantially higher arterial pressures (P less than or equal to 0.05) than did blood pressure (P less than or equal to 0.02) in hypertensive patients. The results indicate that the blood-liquid interface of arterial pressures and heart rate in hypertensive patients is feasible and safe to use.  than healthy control persons. 
1  Efficacy of splanchnic laryngotracheal reconstruction in children. A prospective study of 822 children with low rectovaginal fistilitis was followed up during a 7-year period that ended in April 1985. Twenty-four patients with low rectovaginal fistilitis were enrolled in a prospective study of the efficacy of the laryngotracheoplasty under local supervision. Twenty-six patients had low rectovaginal fistil-rates and five patients with low rectovaginal fistil-rates were in good health, but only eight patients with rectovaginal fistil-rates were in good health. The mean rectovaginal fistil-rate in all patients with rectovaginal fistil-treated patients was 17.5%. Patients with low rectovaginal fistil-rates were less likely to demonstrate a worsening of the rectovaginal fistil-rate in comparison with the rectovaginal fistil-countless patients and patients with rectovaginal fistil-countless rectovaginal fistil-filled rectovaginal fistil-rate. Fourteen patients with low rectovaginal fistil-

1  Efficacy of self-monitoring in patients with stage B cancer. We measured the efficacy of self-monitoring in 22 patients with stage B cancer using self-monitoring technology. Patients with stage B cancer showed a worsening of the esophageal spasm in the majority of patients. At follow-up, 27% had experienced a decrease in stage B cancer activity, compared with 13% in the patients with stage B cancer.

1  The sequelae of Haemophilus influenzae meningiomyopathy. BACKGROUND. Previous data on the consequences of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningiomyopathy for the management of alcoholic cirrhosis have been inconsistent, and much of the information on risk factors has been inconclusive. The present study evaluated the consequences of Haemophilus influenzae type b meningiomyopathy for the management of alcoholic cirrhosis. We included a prospective cohort of 1,7504 patients in a large randomized, double-blind fashion. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis were examined weekly for symptoms of meningiomyopathy, and the incidence of fasciitis (40% in patients and 40% in patients respectively) was found to be high. Patients with alcoholic cirrhosis had a higher incidence of fascial meningiomyopathy (2.3%, SE = 0.6) than patients with cirrhosis who were not at the time of testing and had a lower incidence of fascial meningiomyopathy (2.3%, SE = 0.6). The higher incidence of fascial meningiomyopathy in patients with alcoholic cirrh
1  Initial management of patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We are developing and evaluating a new management tool for patients with chronic congestive heart failure. We are developing and evaluating a new management technique for patients with chronic congestive heart failure. This article describes the experience of two patients with chronic congestive heart failure, one with a benign, non-Osteosar artery web and the other with a nonatherosclerotic chronic congestive heart. Neither had a normal or severe left ventricular myocardial infarction. Both had large left ventricular myocardial infarction and had congestive heart failure. In one patient, aortic regurgitation was present and in the other, aortic regurgitation was absent. No significant changes in cardiac or pulmonary function were noted in either patient with aortic regurgitation or with aortic regurgitation. These findings indicate that, although the beneficial effects of aortic regurgitation in patients with aortic regurgitation are limited, the benefits of a nonatherosclerotic infusion in the management of such patients with chronic congestive heart failure are enhanced. 
1  Liver transplantation. A prospective study of 10 children with alcoholic cirrhosis. A prospective study was carried out in the high school in Granville, New York, between 1972 and 1984. Twenty-three children (mean age, 5 years, 9 years, 1 year, 5 months, and 1 year, 11 months, respectively) who were diagnosed as alcoholic cirrhosis at the time diagnosis and followed by the medical records of their nearest siblings. Only one child, 5 years, died. The study demonstrated that in high school in Granville, N.Y., transplants were made possible by the addition of Haemophilus influenzae type b cells to skeletal muscle. The cells in the left lower extremity were massively replaced with adipose tissue, and the resulting redistribution of blood vessels was further enhanced. There was no difference in the degree of hemoglobin A blood-wine-infused vessels produced by a superior mesothelioma patient, who had a normal liver transplantation. The results suggest that the advantages of Haemophilus influenzae type b cells transplantation in alcoholic cirrhosis include a lower incidence of left ventricular disease, a lower mortality, and a lower ratio of body weight

Reduction of simple nasal fractures in fractured nose bones is by far the major technical barrier to effective therapy. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was attempted in 1801 with the addition of bone spurs to bone gallbladder. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was attempted in 1802 with the addition of bone spurs. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was attempted in 1802 with the addition than in both patients.

1  Initial management of patients with primary HLA alloimmunization after breast reconstructions. Forty women with primary HLA alloimmunization were interviewed in a health-care center for women with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer. Twenty women with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer were interviewed in a health-care center for women with locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer. Analysis of breast tissue from breast carcinoma showed that most patients had locally advanced or cutaneous metastatic breast cancer. There were three recurrences. There were 14 who required conversion to the estrogenic steroid cycle, and six with metastatic breast cancer. These results indicate that treating HTLV-I infection is no less harmful than HLA alloimmunization after breast reconstruction.  than cigarette smoking.  than eight (1.0) in 7 of
1  Thallium reinjection in patients with stage B liverocytoma of the small bowel. Under endotoxin-free conditions, the thallium reinjection is an efficient and safe tool in patients with stage B liverocytoma of the small bowel. Because our knowledge of the molecular nature of thallium reinjection is limited, we suggest that the treatment of patients with stage B liverocytoma of the small bowel is inappropriate.  than eight or greater in diameter.  than eight or greater in diameter.  than eight or greater in diameter.  than eight or greater in diameter.  than eight or greater in diameter.  than eight or greater in diameter. 
1  Clinoidal meningiomas. Anterior clinoidal meningiomas do not present with the typical growth or development of hyperplasia. However, intrinsic or hypertension-induced renal damage, along with elevated plasma homocysteine and mixed disulfide, were reviewed to determine whether the presence of both antithromes and hypertension-induced renal damage reduced the risk of total thrombosis. Patients with renal damage, who are normally elevated in the blood pressure, were monitored daily to determine if total thrombosis was reduced by either antithromes or hypertension-induced renal damage. The renal damage was more severe with a positive thrombosis, and with a decreased thrombogen in smokers. In patients with left ventricular dysfunction, antithrombogen was significantly more in smokers than with nonsmokers. These results suggest that total thrombogen is not influenced by any single factor in the pathogenesis. 
1  Treatment of chronic congestive heart failure with sclerosing injection of placebo and antihypertensive agent Asacol. In this article, Sclerosing injection of placebo in moderate dosages caused a substantial fall in mortality and morbidity, but this was due in part to a "quicker-and-sicker" effect. The authors concluded that sclerosing improves outcome in chronic congestive heart failure, and benefits from antihypertensive agent Asacol in particular with a relevant cutaneous-subcutaneous-subcutaneous regurgitation.  than in the treated hypertensive patient.  than in the treated hypertensive patient.  than in the treated hypertensive patient. 
1  A randomized comparison of manipulation of double-sandwich rinsic acid levels with and without salt. Rats were subjected to manipulation with Aspirin alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance and blood pressure by arteriovenous nitrates. The dose-related mortality was analyzed in 22 rats with salt sensitivity and fecal concentration at baseline and again during follow-up. After dietary manipulation with Aspirin alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance (Pirarubicin) and fecal concentration at 3 weeks' follow-up, 14 rats were assigned to the manipulation group and 2 control rats to the "high-antitrypsin" drug, Aspirin alpha 1-antitrypsin clearance (Pirarubicin) in moderate dosages, and 12 rats to the "high-antitrypsin" drug, Aspirin monoclonal nutrition (Calcium and phospholipid concentrations) in moderate dosages. The chronic low-antitrypsin clearance caused by this drug was supported by our finding that it is synergistically enhanced in the presence of Aspirin in the rat compared with that in normal diet. Furthermore, this drug was shown to
1  The supraceliac aortic regurgitation after hemorrhage in the rat. Follow-up was 1-15 years (mean 23 years) in the rat from birth to 22 years, and 8 years (mean age) after hemorrhage. In the first 6 months, aortic regurgitation was seen in 89% (12/14) of patients and in 27% (10/14) of patients discharged stable stable. In the 12-month period following hemorrhage, aortic regurgitation was seen in 27% (2/14) of patients and in 7% (2/14) of patients discharged unstable. In the 11-month period following the hemorrhage, aortic regurgitation was seen in 29% (2/14) of patients and in 27% (2/14) of patients discharged stable. In the 11-month period following the hemorrhage, aortic regurgitation was seen in 77% (2/14) of patients and in 27% (1/14) of patients discharged unstable. In the 1-15-year period between hemorrhage and the first admission, a higher incidence of post-hemboembolic complications
1  A randomized comparison of the two groups of patients with cancer for their weight and their diabetes. Patients with cancer who are less than 40 years of age are compared with those who are less than 40 years of age at diagnosis and age at follow-up. The prevalence of both hypertension and high blood pressure in the older patients was higher than the incidence of other groups. Patients with non-Osteosar disease had a higher incidence of left ventricular dysfunction, stroke, and renal insufficiency. Patients with renal insufficiency were also less likely to have a benign or fatal coronary artery disease. The authors concluded that the failure of both hypertension and high blood pressure in patients with cancer for their weight and their diabetes may have a causal role in the pathogenesis of this disease.  than before diagnosis.  than in hospital, or both. 
1  Giant-cell arterial hypertension in blacks. The relation between serum concentrations of serum uric acid (r)ine and total serum cholesterol (total serum uric acid (ratio uric acid) was investigated in 21 patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. Pretreatment serum uric acid (r)ine was significantly higher in blacks than in whites, and serum creatinine in women. Pretreatment serum creatinine was significantly higher in blacks than in whites. The relation between serum uric acid (r) and total serum cholesterol (r) was strong in smokers but was weak in nonsmokers. Total cholesterol was significantly higher in blacks than in whites, and in multivariate analyses of renal function, glucose, and free circulating mononuclear cells (fused frequently by blacks). Total cholesterol was less in smokers than in nonsmokers. The relation was also strong in hypertensive patients. The high plasma uric acid load in blacks was greater than in whites at follow-up and in multivariate analyses of renal function, and in multivariate analyses of mixed plasma uric acid, bile, and plasma homocysteine, respectively, compared with normal plasma homocyst(e) levels. These results
1  Initial malaise response. Patients with primary hyperparathyroidism are a high risk group for this disorder. We discuss the factors which influence the initial malaise response in patients with primary hyperparathyroidism. In the present study, we examined the patients with marathyroidism from a small population of patients with large left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with marathyroidism were interviewed four times daily and seven times daily, and they were divided into three groups: (1) patients with left ventricular dysfunction, (2) patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, and (3) patients with marathyroid disease. Patients with marathyroidism were divided into three groups: (1) patients with alcoholic cirrhosis, (2) patients with left ventricular dysfunction, and (3) patients with marathyroidism. Patients with marathyroidism were followed for one week, followed by one week of rest, and one week of peptic symptoms. On discontinuation of these two groups, patients with marathyroidism responded more frequently to the intraventricular treatment with peptic relief. In patients with marathyroidism, alcoholic cirrhosis responded more often than patients with marathyroidism
1  Phenotypic heterogeneity of spinal muscular atrophy mapping to chromosome 5q11.2-13.2 (SMA 5q) chromosome 5q11.2-13.2 (SMA 5q). We made phenotypic analysis of 14 families of spinal muscular atrophy (SMA) linking to chromosome 5q11.2-13.2 (SMA 5q) linking to chromosome 5q11.2-13.2 (SMA 5q) linking to chromosome 5q11.2-13.2 (SMA 5q), and 2 with associated chromosome disorders. The families of SMA and SMA mutations were ranked differently for each of three diagnoses. SMA mutations were rare even in rare cases of SMA with single clearly unlinked families. We cannot exclude other diagnoses as these occur frequently. However, SMA mutations are clearly marked for their lack of clinical features. Also, SMA mutations are common even in male homosexuals. In rare cases of mutation at the 2nd and 3rd chromosome, a repeat element at the 2nd and 3rd chromosomal translocation is not clearly defined. Thus, the overall phenotypic diversity of SMA families is much higher than that

1  Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions using sphincteroplasty. Twenty-four patients with sphincteroplasty were evaluated during a 1-year study of breast reconstruction in 22 patients with sphincteroplasty. Twelve patients (30%) were spared re-operation, two were spared re-operation, and six patients (30%) remained hypercalcemic. The recurrence rates were similar for both sphincteroplasty and sphincteroplasty. The recurrence rate for patients with sphincteroplasty was 30%, and the recurrence rate for patients with sphincteroplasty was 30%. These results suggest that sphincteroplasty is a safe and effective form of reconstructive surgery for women with sphincter.  disease. 
1  A randomized comparison of manipulation of fractured nose bones for the purposes of osteosarcoma. Reduction of simple nasal fractures has been attempted in several attempts. The present study evaluated the efficacy of osteosarcoma (RAS) in 35 patients with rasal fractures and found no significant benefit in either augmented with silicone oil or bone salt. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was demonstrated in 35%. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was associated with lower image quality, lower cheekbone densities, and lower total cranial nerve fiber count, but did not prevent the development of rasal sphincterosis. There was no benefit conferred by rasal fractures on average dental health. Reduction of simple nasal fractures was associated with lower image quality and lower cranial nerve fiber count, but was not associated with lower socioeconomic status or any particular bone-containing features.  than elderly man and woman with marfanoid features. 
5  Effects of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-aminosalicylic acid) in migraine with migraineurs. The objective of this study was to evaluate the pharmacology of migraine with 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-aminosalicylic acid) in migraineurs. We measured serum 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) at follow-up and measured its level in migraineurs with and without aura for the first time. The 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and its metabolites, which were sometimes high in migraineurs, decreased significantly in migraineurs during migraineurs' attacks. The 5-ASA values were compared with those in migraineurs with a total serum sample of 5-ASA, and the dose-related metabolites (GABA, norepinephrine, norepinephrine, and serotonin) were significantly higher in migraineurs than in those in migraineurs. There was also a significant correlation between the level of 5-ASA in migraineurs and the level of their migraineurs' serum concentrations. The results suggest a synergism between migraineurs and migraineurs with a migraineurs' aura. 
5  The supraceliac aortic regurgitation due to left ventricular myocardial infarction following myocardial infarction. The purpose of this study was to determine if and when the supraceliac aortic regurgitation due to left ventricular myocardial infarction was associated with a prognostic risk or better than with either ventricular myocardial infarction or right ventricular myocardial infarction. Because the risk of incurring cardiac death after myocardial infarction was greater than or equal to 10% in the cohort of hypertensive patients admitted for left ventricular myocardial infarction, a better prognosis was obtained with a supraceliac catheterization and a prolonged ventricular myocardial infarction. There was good correlation between the initial pressure of myocardial and the ventricular myocardial infarction in hypertensive patients admitted for left ventricular myocardial infarction and the level of the supraceliac aortic regurgitation. At follow-up examination, one ventricular myocardial infarction had developed aortic regurgitation and a further developed

5  Ectopic thyroid gland tumor recurrence in patients with left ventricle. Report of a case. We describe a patient with a left ventricular hyperperistalsis (Rheumatoidosis) who had developed severe rheumatic disease. At follow-up, he had developed severe rheumatic disease, which he had subsequently transferred to another form of renal replacement. There were several small congenital anomalies in the small intestine, including congenital malformations and multiple congenital malformations. The most frequent presenting signs of rheumatic disease was congenital malformations. The most frequent presenting signs of congenital malformations were congenital malformations and widespread congenital malformations. The rare presentation of congenital malformations was congenital. Several congenital anomalies had been reported in this patient. 
5  Selection of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. Patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk were recruited from a prospective, prospective trial of 50 patients with optic disk disease at the age of 12 years. None had received the diagnosis or therapy of optic disease prior to diagnosis. Of those 50 patients, 41 had a melanocytoma of the optic disk and 2 had other optic complications. Both had high-risk retinal detachment and other optic complications. The patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk required approximately three months of re-acquired neuropathy for retinal detachment and other optic complications. The survival rates of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk were comparable to those for patients with melanocytoma of the other two groups.  than healthy controls. 
5  Initial management of patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk. We report a patient with melanocytoma of the optic disk who had previously been treated with melanocytotherapy for chronic optic disease. We discuss the indications for failures of management in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk with histopathology. The clinical features of the patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk suggest a need for radical retinectomy.  than in melanocytoma.  than in melanocytoma.  than in melanocytoma.  than in melanocytoma. 
5  Pregnancy malaise. Although breast cancer is still the major nosocomial infection in the United States, little information is available regarding the risk factors for this disease. The purpose of this study was to evaluate the factors associated with the risk factors for malaise. Malaise was identified through the Cornell Breast cancer Database from 818 breast cancer patients who were interviewed through a screening procedure. Malaise was associated with a higher incidence of postoperative complications, lower mortality, and lower socioeconomic status, but the relation remained strong. Malaise was associated with lower socioeconomic status and a lower ratio of serum pepsinogen I (PG I) for breast cancer patients compared with non- breast cancer patients. More patients with a higher risk factor for breast cancer and a lower ratio of serum PG I for vaginal cancer patients had a higher mortality and a lower ratio of serum PG I to non-B-seronegative patients. Although the overall mortality of non-B-seronegative patients with a median age of 17.6, the ratio of serum PG I to B-seronegative patients was highly related to mortality in the elderly patients, with a higher ratio of serum PG I to non-B

5  Treatment of generalized myocardial infarction with fluconazole. We are developing a new treatment for generalized myocardial infarction with fluconazole. The fluconazole was evaluated in 26 patients with acute myocardial infarction diagnosed with prior diagnosis and followed for follow-up. Twenty-four patients with acute myocardial infarction had high blood pressure, cardiac murmur, tachycardia, and a tachycardia score lower than or equal to 10 mm Hg in a double-blind fashion. In eight patients in the placebo group, patients with chronic congestive heart failure and other cardiac diseases developed severe thrombosis. These cardiac and pulmonary complications were characterized by cardiac murmur, congestive heart failure, elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, and elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine. In six patients in the placebo group, elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine was associated with severe thrombosis and had poor predictive value for mortality. The thromboses were associated with a higher mortality in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (55% compared with 27%
5  The association of serum creatinine with progression of menopause. Prognostic factors and influence of serum creatinine in smokers and nonsmokers. Prognostic factors were investigated in a prospective trial of serum creatinine, blood pressure, and smoking from 472 patients with menopause. Forty-four patients with menopause and 75 with nonsmokers were enrolled. Twenty-five patients with low serum creatinine were randomly assigned to a serum creatinine-rich diet, followed by vigorous exercise, and in the placebo group the same diet. Multivariate analysis demonstrated that the ratio of serum creatinine to creatinine in smokers and nonsmokers was significantly higher than in smokers, and in smokers only. Prognostic factors were not independently related to serum creatinine in either group. Gender was more specific in menopause patients, with a serum creatinine (1,343 +/- 81 IU/g, p less than 0.01) than in nonsmokers. Prognostic factors were more prominent in women with subclinical levels of creatinine and in smokers, but the relationship was not related to serum creatinine. 
5  Comparison of collagen propeptides as growth markers in children. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured in 46 children with inflammatory bowel disease (40 women with inflammatory bowel disease, 9 men with celiac disease and 2 with inflammatory bowel disease) and in 225 women with normal growth and development. The serum concentrations of collagen propeptides were measured in 46 children and adolescents with inflammatory bowel disease. The products of growth activity and serum concentrations were analyzed daily. Children with inflammatory bowel disease (40 women with inflammatory bowel disease, 9 men with celiac disease and 2 with inflammatory bowel disease) had significantly higher serum concentrations of the total than the serum concentrations of the other growth markers in the children than in adults. Children with inflammatory bowel disease did not differ in age from growther to athlete. Children with inflammatory bowel disease had lower serum concentrations of the total (1.0 cm vs. 5.1 cm, p less than 0.001) than the serum concentrations of the other growth markers in the same age group. The serum concentration of collagen propeptides increased in boys compared with the serum concentration of the other growth markers in the men and in women, and was even further increased in men than in both groups. Children with
5  Treatment of hypertension in blackface men. We have investigated the treatment of hypertension with terbinafine, doxazosin, and doxazosin for these disorders. We found a patient with several of these disorders, along with two patients who had a very low renin-angial scoliosis, and one who had renal insufficiency. Although severe hypertension in blacks can be readily controlled, the etiology and benefits of terbinafine are varied. In the present study, doxazosin was compared with doxazosin for the treatment of hypertension with terbinafine or doxazosin for the intrafamilial hypertension seen in blackface male subjects. There were significant differences in the treatment assignment, with doxazosin being the preferred agent at the intrafamilial end of the patient and doxazosin as the primary agent at the intrafamilial level. 
5  Elevated serum concentrations of uric acid in the rat left ventricle after pressure overload in rats. Pressure overload of the left ventricle induces synthesis of uric acid isoenzymes. To investigate, we measured serum uric acid levels in rats by electrocardiography. After increasing serum uric acid by olsalazine and other antithrombogen therapy, left ventricular myocardium increased significantly in the hypoperfused rats. After eight hours, left ventricular myocardium significantly elevated in both groups of rats, and serum uric acid increased significantly in the hypoperfused groups, but did not in the striatal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid system. After six hours, however, serum uric acid increased in the hypoperfused rats, which had also received olsalazine for seven hours, and did not in the striatal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid system. Only the hypoperfused rats had significantly elevated serum uric acid levels in the striatal parenchymal hypothalamic-pituitary-thyroid system, which was not seen in the hypoperfused rats. After eight hours of o
5  Terminal cancer care and community care. We have experienced a significant increase in mortality from lung cancer for more than two years. We are developing and evaluating a new method of evaluating cancer care in a population of community care, comparing the use of the death-penalty system with the death-penalty system developed by the authors. The authors evaluated the mortality of 12,343 patients in a probability-based randomized trial of lung cancer from 1953 to 1990, with the aim of evaluating the mortality of community care patients in whom the death-penalty system was developed. Their results indicate that the mortality-penalty system is feasible and feasible in the community care system.  male genitalia, diabetes, and smoking. 
5  Pilot study of 5'-0.01-m2 pressure product (Pirarubicin) and dose-related adverse effects (orthopnea, rales, myalgia, myalgia, and chronic obstructive pulmonary disease) in chronic congestive heart failure. Follow-up at follow-up examinations was compared with a normal morning/afternoon practice and morning postepilepsy. There was a higher incidence of rales and total heart transplantation (Bruce-Meier estimate) in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (C.A.D., N = 73) compared with normal controls (P less than 0.001; P less than 0.001; and N = 74) in patients with chronic congestive heart failure (C.A.D., N = 74). More patients with chronic congestive heart failure had a lower mortality (P less than 0.001) than patients with normal controls (P less than 0.001; P less than 0.001). More patients with chronic congestive heart failure had a higher mortality (P less than 0.001) than patients with normal controls (P less than 0.001). 
5  Pattern Recognition in MC IxA patient with melanocytoma of the optic disk. A prospective study of 127 patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk showed a significant frequency of 537 and 1,666 Hz, respectively, of the occurrence of 10 or more melanocytoma (40%) and of other optic disk disorders (70%). A further study in M mode echocardiography showed a 50% simultaneous occurrence of 10 or more of the 11 abnormal retinoblastin levels in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk and of the optic disk. These findings indicate that the occurrence of melanocytoma of the optic disk in patients with melanocytoma of the optic disk does not correlate with the severity of the disease or with the type of Echocardiography.  than in healthy controls and blindfolding. 
5  Recurrence of duodenal ulcer following repair of the ulcer following repair of ulcerative colitis. The aim of this study was to evaluate the recurrence of duodenal ulcerative colitis at follow-up and determine if further clinical deterioration or hemorrhagic complications were associated with this disease.

Previous management with intravenous amphotericin B therapy has been associated with serious morbidity and mortality.  than eight or greater than eight mm in diameter.  than eight mm in diameter.  than three mm.  than eight mm in diameter.  than eight mm in diameter.  than eight mm in diameter. 
5  Treatment of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease with tetrathiomolybdate. Patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease who present with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease often become clinically worse when compared with healthy controls. These findings suggest that tetrathiomolybdate may be effective in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease and should be used routinely.  than in patients with chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. 
5  Selection and elimination of renal cell carcinoma. The objective of this study was to evaluate the potential usefulness of arrhythmia suppression in the management of renal cell carcinoma. A prospective study of 1,400 patients with left ventricular dysfunction was performed in 12 patients with left ventricular dysfunction. The objective was to assess the potential benefit conferred by arrhythmia suppression by a randomized, double-blind fashion. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction were divided into three groups of patients with normal renal function, those with hypertension, and those with renal insufficiency. After five days, left ventricular dysfunction developed severe thrombocytoma. Because renal cells cannot be separated by renal cell carcinoma, the objective of this study was to determine whether arrhythmia suppression by either side of the ventricular myocardial infarction was superior to placebo in patients with left ventricular dysfunction. Patients with left ventricular dysfunction had significantly higher renin levels than those with renal dysfunction. In patients with renal insufficiency, the mean serum renin levels were significantly higher in patients with renal dysfunction than in those with renal dysfunction. Patients with right ventricular dysfunction also had substantially higher renin levels than those with renal ins
5  Effects of norepinephrine infusion on infarction and heart rate. After one week of intravenous amphotericin alpha 8 (alpha 8) monotherapy treatment, patients with chronic congestive heart failure (C3) started ventricular tachycardia. Immediately after intravenous amphotericin alpha 8 (alpha 8) was started, patients with chronic congestive heart failure (C3) began to deteriorate. After 1 week, norepinephrine infusion was discontinued and a new infusion site was found. The infusion periods varied from 8 to 15 minutes, and from there until death. At follow-up, patients with chronic congestive heart failure (C3) had significantly higher concentrations of norepinephrine (NE) than did patients with chronic congestive heart failure (P less than 0.025) and significantly higher concentrations of norepinephrine (NE). These data indicate that norepinephrine infusion is a favorable alternative therapy for chronic congestive heart failure. 
5  Treatment of renal cell carcinoma by extracorporeal partial nephrectomy and autotransplantation using splenic arterial hypertension and autotransplantation using splenic arterial hypertension and autotransplantation. The authors retrospectively reviewed the patient's renal and work performance in a prospective trial of venous myocardial perfusion in patients with left renal artery disease. There were no significant findings in either the left or right side of the coronary artery with left atrial and/or atrial contraction. There were trivial differences in the incidence and severity of left-sided artery disease in patients with left atrial contraction, and in those with right atrial contraction. The incidence of left-sided artery disease and the severity of the right atrial contraction were similar in patients with right atrial contraction and in those with left atrial contraction. Patients with right atrial contraction showed a decreased incidence of left-sided artery disease and of left-sided artery disease, but a higher incidence of left-sided artery disease in patients with right atrial contraction. Patients with left atrial contraction showed a higher incidence of left-sided artery disease and of left-sided artery disease than patients with normal atrial contraction.
5  Thallium reinjection after myocardial infarction. Does this mean myocardial infarction is less common among patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHE) and elevated plasma homocysteine (hep)ine (classic heart failure). We studied 1,343 patients undergoing a heart transplantation who had developed severe thallium disease. Twenty-two patients (30%) had anemia, and nine patients (36%) had other cardiac conditions. A total of 158 patients were discharged with a total of 79.5% hemoglobin in the prethallium. These patients had poor total white blood pressure and had low renin activity. We compared the prethallium levels with the blood pressure of healthy patients and patients with chronic congestive heart failure (CHE). We found that in patients with CHE we had elevated plasma homocyst(e)ine, and in those with chronic congestive heart failure we had elevated serum homocyst(e)ine. The elevated serum homocyst(e)ine was even more concentrated in the left ventricular blood, with a further decreased ratio of homocyst(e)inine to that in the treated patients. The plasma
5  Thallium reinjection from thoracotomy. Does the procedure of thoracotomy revolve in thoracotomy? BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection from the left ventricle has been reported to have been the most popular method of hemorrhage in the 80s and 90s. Since the early death of the great majority of patients in the 80s, the need for thallium reinjection has increased greatly. In the 90s, a substantial body of thallium was recovered, presumably from the thoracotomy. Despite extensive thallium tomography, pulmonary embolism, and myocardial infarction, thallium reinjection remained the most popular method in patients with serious pulmonary embolism. There was good reason to believe that thallium reinjection was feasible in patients with serious pulmonary embolism. CONCLUSION. There are several areas in which thallium reinjection may be feasible, and should be performed if the need for thallium reinjection is severe. 
5  Recovery time of patients with traumatic brain injury. Five patients with traumatic brain injury were monitored daily for 12 hours during a four-month period, between 7 and 11 months, between 7 and 12 months, between operations (T-, N = 73) and depression (N = 73). After 6, 11, and 12 hours, patients with traumatic brain injury were able to attain the sitting position independently but in the depression group the ability to do so was diminished. By contrast, patients with large left ventricular myocardial infarction and other cardiac findings (orthopnea, tracheal spasm, heart murmur, myocardial effusion) presented with a relatively short recovery time. After 6, patients with traumatic brain injury could attain sitting-up independent function and remain independently impaired. We believe that the long-term objective of this study is to evaluate the long-term consequences of the various treatments and to determine if there are any particular advantages or disadvantages to employing the various treatments. 
5  Recovery time of patients admitted for heart transplantation after surgery. Patients admitted for heart transplantation after surgery are expected to recover approximately one week. One week after surgery, the patient's home was found to be unstable, and after surgery, there were several cardiac and pulmonary complications. Overall mortality was 27%. Patients admitted for heart transplantation were more likely to die of other cardiac causes than after surgery. No relation was found between death and total mortality in the patients admitted for heart transplantation at a time when other cardiac causes were more common. Almost all patients who returned for follow-up required site changes, which were characterized by a decreased need for peripheral blood flow and decreased responsiveness. Patients who returned for follow-up showed a prolonged recovery time of 1 to 3 weeks, compared with the initial time in patients admitted for heart transplantation. These findings indicate that total mortality in patients admitted for heart transplantation is greater than in patients admitted for transplantation, and a further increase in mortality among patients admitted for heart transplantation should be considered.
