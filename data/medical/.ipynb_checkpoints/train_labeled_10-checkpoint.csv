Single-stage laryngotracheal reconstruction. The mainstay for repairing subglottic and tracheal stenosis has been the rib graft with prolonged stenting. A refinement of this treatment was the use of the anterior cricoid decompression (split). We present single-stage reconstruction of the airway as an additional refinement of the laryngotracheoplasty. This article describes the experience of two institutions with single-stage reconstruction and offers some observations on the principles of the technique. ,5
"Treatment of angiomas with sclerosing injection of hydroxypolyethoxydodecan. The authors discuss the indications for hydroxypolyethoxydodecan in the sclerosing treatment of angiomas, with particular reference to cavernous, venous, and evolutive angiomas (ie, immature angiomas that fail to involute by eight to ten months). Moreover, the sclerosing agent may be employed, in connection with embolization and subsequent surgery, in arteriovenous angiomas with a relevant cutaneous-subcutaneous development. The authors have successfully used the ""interstitial"" sclerosing technique, according to Andrews' method. This technique involves interstitial injections to obtain the sclerosis of the thin threads of fibrous tissue stroma between the blood vessels. The sclerosing therapy may cause the complete regression of ""low flow"" angiomas or, at least, a partial reduction that simplifies the ensuing surgical excision. In the case of partial regression of the angioma obtained with the sclerosing therapy, the surgery of the remaining angioma causes a lesser degree of bleeding (especially in areas that do not particularly lend themselves to surgical exploration, ie, the oral cavity); an increased reliability in the radicality of the intervention (due also to the reduced size of the lesion); and better results from an aesthetic-functional point of view.

"Endoscopic palliative intubation of the esophagus invaded by lung cancer. Thirty-two patients with esophageal involvement by lung cancer were managed by endoscopic intubation. In 22 patients with extrinsic esophageal strictures, the success rate of intubation was 91%, and 82% were discharged with their dysphagia relieved and esophageal patency restored. The mean survival rate was 4.4 months. In 10 patients with esophago-bronchial fistulas, 3 had the fistulous tract obliterated and lived a mean of 5 months. This low success rate of closing fistulas is due to failure to seal off the space between the stent and the fistula because of absence of tumor-associated stenosis. The overall morbidity rate was 28.1% (18.8% perforation, 6.3% hemorrhage, and 3.1% tracheal obstruction). The overall mortality rate was 18.8%. Although complications were more frequent than in primary esophageal tumors, endoscopic intubation was the only way to palliate this desperate condition and provided 66.6% of patients with relief of symptoms, nutritional improvement, and a mean survival time of 4.5 months.

"Prospective payment system and impairment at discharge. The 'quicker-and-sicker' story revisited Since the introduction of the prospective payment system (PPS), anecdotal evidence has accumulated that patients are leaving the hospital ""quicker and sicker."" We developed valid measures of discharge impairment and measured these levels in a nationally representative sample of patients with one of five conditions prior to and following the PPS implementation. Instability at discharge (important clinical problems usually first occurring prior to discharge) predicted the likelihood of postdischarge deaths. At 90 days postdischarge, 16% of patients discharged unstable were dead vs 10% of patients discharged stable. After the PPS introduction, instability increased primarily among patients discharged home. Prior to the PPS, 10% of patients discharged home were unstable; after the PPS was implemented, 15% were discharged unstable, a 43% relative change. Efforts to monitor the effect of this increase in discharge instability on health should be implemented. ",3
"Thallium reinjection after stress-redistribution imaging. Does 24-hour delayed imaging after reinjection enhance detection of viable myocardium? BACKGROUND. Thallium reinjection immediately after conventional stress-redistribution imaging improves the detection of viable myocardium, as many myocardial regions with apparently ""irreversible"" thallium defects on standard 3-4-hour redistribution images manifest enhanced thallium uptake after reinjection. Because the 10-minute period between reinjection and imaging may be too short, the present study was designed to determine whether 24-hour imaging after thallium reinjection provides additional information regarding myocardial viability beyond that obtained by imaging shortly after reinjection. METHODS AND RESULTS. We studied 50 patients with chronic stable coronary artery disease undergoing exercise thallium tomography, radionuclide angiography, and coronary arteriography. Immediately after the 3-4-hour redistribution images were obtained, 1 mCi thallium was injected at rest, and images were reacquired at 10 minutes and 24 hours after reinjection. The stress, redistribution, reinjection, and 24-hour images were then analyzed qualitatively and quantitatively. Of the 127 abnormal myocardial regions on the stress images, 55 had persistent defects on redistribution images by qualitative analysis, of which 25 (45%) demonstrated improved thallium uptake after reinjection. At the 24-hour study, 23 of the 25 regions (92%) with previously improved thallium uptake by reinjection showed no further improvement. Similarly, of the 30 regions determined to have irreversible defects after reinjection, 29 (97%) remained irreversible on 24-hour images. These findings were confirmed by the quantitative analysis. The mean normalized thallium activity in regions with enhanced thallium activity after reinjection increased from 57 +/- 13% on redistribution studies to 70 +/- 14% after reinjection but did not change at 24 hours (71 +/- 14%). In regions with irreversible defects that were unaltered by reinjection, mean regional thallium activity did not differ from the reinjection to the 24-hour studies (57 +/- 17% and 58 +/- 17%, respectively). Twenty-four-hour imaging after reinjection showed improvement in only four of 35 irreversible regions (involving three of the 50 patients). CONCLUSIONS. These data indicate that thallium reinjection at rest after 3-4 hours of redistribution provides most of the clinically relevant information pertaining to myocardial viability in regions with apparently irreversible thallium defects. Hence, thallium reinjection may be used instead of 24-hour imaging in most patients in whom a persistent thallium defect is observed on conventional redistribution images. ",4
"Disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid by olsalazine and three mesalazine preparations in patients with ulcerative colitis: comparison of intraluminal colonic concentrations, serum values, and urinary excretion. To compare the disposition of 5-aminosalicylic acid (5-ASA) and its acetylated metabolite during treatment with olsalazine and mesalazine, 14 patients with inactive ulcerative colitis were randomly assigned to olsalazine (1 g twice daily) and the mesalazines, Asacol (800 + 400 + 800 mg daily), Pentasa (750 + 500 + 750 mg daily), and Salofalk (750 + 500 + 750 mg daily) in a crossover design trial so that all received each drug for seven days. Intraluminal colonic concentrations of 5-ASA were estimated after five days by the method of equilibrium in vivo dialysis of faeces. A predose serum sample and a 24 hour urine collection were obtained on day seven. The 5-ASA and acetyl-5-aminosalicylic acid (Ac-5-ASA) values were determined by high performance liquid chromatography. Olsalazine almost doubled the colonic concentrations (mean 23.7 (SEM) (1.9) mmol/l) of its therapeutically active ingredient (5-ASA) compared with equimolar doses of Pentasa (12.6 (2.2) mmol/l; p less than 0.0003) and Salofalk (15.0 (2.0) mmol/l; p less than 0.003). At the same time, olsalazine treatment was associated with lower serum concentrations and urinary excretions (p less than 0.05) of 5-ASA and Ac-5-ASA compared with the mesalazine preparations. The low systemic load of 5-ASA provided by olsalazine reduces the potential risk of nephrotoxicity during long term treatment. ",2
"Giant-cell arteritis of the uterus with associated temporal arteritis: a case report. Giant-cell arteritis involving the uterus was identified incidentally upon hysterectomy and anterior colporrhaphy for uterine prolapse. Subsequently, the patient was found to have giant-cell temporal arteritis presenting with fever of unknown origin. Fourteen previous cases involving the female genital tract have been reported. There appears to be an association between constitutional symptoms of fever, weight loss, malaise, headache, and polymyalgia rheumatica in elderly women with uterine prolapse and giant-cell arteritis of the genital tract. The rare presentation of giant-cell arteritis in the female genital tract does not support invasive costly evaluation in asymptomatic patients. However, a thorough investigation for involvement of other sites, including appropriate treatment for generalized disease, should be undertaken. ",4
"Gynecomastia. A bothersome but readily treatable problem. Although breast enlargement in boys and men can cause both psychological and physical distress, the disorder is rarely serious and is readily treatable. Several factors can lead to the estrogenic excess that causes growth of breast tissue. Dr Jacobs describes a patient with gynecomastia related to cirrhosis of the liver who responded promptly to a brief course of tamoxifen citrate therapy. ",2
"Complications of Tenckhoff catheters post removal. Complications due to Tenckhoff catheters can occur at prolonged intervals after their removal. From January 1979 to October 1989, 431 patients at our center began continuous ambulatory peritoneal dialysis (CAPD), 278 of whom subsequently transferred to another form of renal replacement therapy. We identified 12 patients (4.3% or 12/278) with post removal catheter complications. There were 14 post removal complications, two each in two patients, and one in each of 12 others. The mean time to complication was 541 +/- 143 days (27-2,040). In 71% (10/14) of the complications, an abscess was found at the site of the previously removed Tenckhoff catheter. In 29% (4/14) of the complications, foreign body material consistent with a retained cuff was recovered. Documentation at the time of Tenckhoff catheter removal should include a statement regarding the presence of the Tenckhoff catheter cuffs, and patients with retained cuffs should be monitored closely for the development of abscesses or other complications. Immunocompromised patients are at high risk for these complications. ",2
"Scoliosis in trisomy 18. Patients with trisomy 18 typically present with multiple congenital anomalies and most die within the first year. However, long-term survivors are not uncommon. Seventeen patients with trisomy 18 were evaluated to study the development of scoliosis associated with this disorder. There were 13 females and 4 males with ages ranging from birth to 22 years. Twelve patients died by age 2. None developed scoliosis or had vertebral anomalies. The five patients who survived beyond age 2 developed scoliosis. Curve progression was demonstrated in the patients who returned for follow-up. Bracing was not well tolerated in two patients with curves of 48 degrees and 58 degrees. Both had poor motor control and sitting ability. One patient with a 30 degree curve was successfully managed by bracing. Another patient with a severe scoliosis was successfully fused with anterior and posterior instrumentation. Patients with trisomy 18 should be carefully evaluated for scoliosis. Scoliosis in the older child, surviving beyond age 2, may be progressive and difficult to manage. ",5
"Sixty consecutive breast reconstructions with the inflatable expander: a critical appraisal. Breast reconstruction using inflatable expanders has become an established and preferred technique. Although our knowledge of the biomechanical changes occurring in expanded skin has increased greatly, little information is available regarding average aesthetic results achieved with this technique. In order to eliminate the bias of best case selection reports, this study of 60 consecutive patients undergoing skin-expansion breast reconstruction was undertaken. Results of the study demonstrated a significant frequency and diversity of complications. In particular, immediate breast reconstruction with skin expanders was identified as a high-risk procedure because of its association with skin necrosis and delayed wound healing. Although two procedures--insertion and replacement--had been anticipated, patients from both the Boston and New York groups required approximately three operations to complete the expansion process. Average aesthetic results, often characterized by problems of symmetry, ptosis, and contour, need to be recognized and improved. ",5
"Clinical, radiographic, and hemodynamic correlations in chronic congestive heart failure: conflicting results may lead to inappropriate care. PURPOSE: Clinical and radiographic examinations are commonly used for estimating severity and titrating therapy of chronic congestive heart failure. The purpose of this study was to establish the relationship between findings on history, physical examination, chest roentgenogram, and pulmonary capillary wedge pressure (PCWP). PATIENTS AND METHODS: Fifty-two consecutive patients with chronic congestive heart failure, referred for evaluation for heart transplantation, were studied; all patients underwent history, physical examination, upright chest roentgenogram, and cardiac catheterization. The mean left ventricular ejection fraction was 0.19 +/- 0.06. Patients were divided into three groups according to their PCWP: Group 1, normal PCWP (less than or equal to 15 mm Hg, n = 19); Group 2, mild to moderately elevated PCWP (16 to 29 mm Hg, n = 15); Group 3, markedly elevated PCWP (greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg, n = 18). RESULTS: Physical and radiographic signs of congestion were more common in the groups with higher PCWP, but they could not be used to reliably separate patients with different filling pressures. Physical findings (orthopnea, edema, rales, third heart sound, elevated jugular venous pressure) or radiographic signs (cardiomegaly, vascular redistribution, and interstitial and alveolar edema) had poor predictive value for identifying patients with PCWP values greater than or equal to 30 mm Hg. These findings had poor negative predictive value to exclude significantly elevated PCWP (greater than 20 mm Hg). Radiographic pulmonary congestion was absent in eight (53%) patients in Group 2 and seven (39%) in Group 3. In patients in Group 2 and 3, those without radiographic congestion were in a better New York Heart Association functional class (3.5 +/- 0.5 versus 2.8 +/- 0.6, p less than 0.01). There was good correlation between right atrial pressure and PCWP (r = 0.64, p less than 0.001). A normal right atrial pressure had no predictive value, but a pressure greater than 10 mm Hg was seen in all but one patient with a PCWP value greater than 20 mm Hg. CONCLUSION: Clinical, radiographic, and hemodynamic evaluations of chronic congestive heart failure yield conflicting results. Absence of radiographic or physical signs of congestion does not ensure normal PCWP values and may lead to inaccurate diagnosis and inadequate therapy. It is not known whether therapy aimed at normalizing PCWP is superior to relieving clinical and radiographic signs of congestion. ",5
"Association between neuroepithelial tumor and multiple intestinal polyposis (Turcot's syndrome): report of a case and critical analysis of the literature. We report a case of association of a brain tumor with multiple intestinal polyposis (Turcot's syndrome) and offer a critical analysis of the relevant literature with a view to revising the classification of the syndrome in relation to familial multiple polyposis and Gardner's syndrome. For this purpose, we considered only cases of intestinal polyposis associated with a primary neuroepithelial tumor (medulloblastoma, glioma, or glioblastoma) as originally described by Turcot. Differences emerged, depending on the central nervous system tumor type, which suggests that this neoplastic association may be classified as two distinct syndromes. ",1
"Early diastolic clicks after the Fontan procedure for double inlet left ventricle: anatomical and physiological correlates. M mode echocardiograms and simultaneous phonocardiograms were recorded in four patients with early diastolic clicks on auscultation. All had double inlet left ventricle and had undergone the Fontan procedure with closure of the right atrioventricular valve orifice by an artificial patch. The phonocardiogram confirmed a high frequency sound occurring 60-90 ms after aortic valve closure and coinciding with the time of maximal excursion of the atrioventricular valve patch towards the ventricular mass. One patient had coexisting congenital complete heart block. The M mode echocardiogram showed ""reversed"" motion of the patch towards the right atrium during atrial contraction. Doppler flow studies showed that coincident with this motion there was forward flow in the pulmonary artery with augmentation when atrial contraction coincided with ventricular systole. The early diastolic click in these patients was explained by abrupt cessation of the motion of the atrioventricular valve patch towards the ventricular mass in early diastole. In one patient atrial contraction led to a reversal of this motion and was associated with forward flow in the pulmonary artery. ",5
"Genetic mechanisms of tumor suppression by the human p53 gene. Mutations of the gene encoding p53, a 53-kilodalton cellular protein, are found frequently in human tumor cells, suggesting a crucial role for this gene in human oncogenesis. To model the stepwise mutation or loss of both p53 alleles during tumorigenesis, a human osteosarcoma cell line, Saos-2, was used that completely lacked endogenous p53. Single copies of exogenous p53 genes were then introduced by infecting cells with recombinant retroviruses containing either point-mutated or wild-type versions of the p53 cDNA sequence. Expression of wild-type p53 suppressed the neoplastic phenotype of Saos-2 cells, whereas expression of mutated p53 conferred a limited growth advantage to cells in the absence of wild-type p53. Wild-type p53 was phenotypically dominant to mutated p53 in a two-allele configuration. These results suggest that, as with the retinoblastoma gene, mutation of both alleles of the p53 gene is essential for its role in oncogenesis. ",1
"Quadricuspid aortic valve and aortic regurgitation diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography: report of two cases and review of the literature. Two cases of patients with quadricuspid aortic valve diagnosed by Doppler echocardiography are presented. Aortic regurgitation was detected by pulsed Doppler echocardiography in both patients. Because they were young patients, this aortic regurgitation indicated that aortic regurgitation is not necessarily a late-developing event, as has been thought previously. ",4
"Use of leukocyte-depleted platelet concentrates for the prevention of refractoriness and primary HLA alloimmunization: a prospective, randomized trial. Compared with conventional transfusion regimes a strong reduction in HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions is obtained when both red blood cell concentrates (RBCs) and platelet concentrates (PCs) are depleted of leukocytes by filtration. Because most of the leukocyte contamination is introduced by transfusion of RBCs, filtration of RBCs appears rational, but uncertainty exists regarding the degree of leukocyte-depletion of PCs needed for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness. We conducted a prospective trial and randomized patients with acute leukemia to receive leukocyte-depleted PCs prepared either by centrifugation (mean leukocyte count 35 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U) or by filtration (mean leukocyte count less than 5 x 10(6)/PC of 6 U). Both groups received RBCs that were filtered after prior removal of the buffy coat. Clinical refractoriness occurred in 46% (12 of 26) of the evaluable patients that were transfused with centrifuged PCs and only in 11% (3 of 27) in the filtered group (P less than .005). De novo anti-HLA antibodies were detected in 42% (11 of 26) patients in the centrifuged group and only in 7% (2 of 27) of the patients receiving filtered PCs (P less than .004). In 8 of 11 alloimmunized patients in the centrifuged group antibodies were detected in the first 4 weeks of transfusion therapy while none of the patients in the filtered group became immunized against HLA antigens during that period. We conclude that for the prevention of HLA alloimmunization and refractoriness to platelet transfusions from random donors, both RBCs and PCs have to be leukocyte-depleted by filtration. ",1
"The supraspinal anxiolytic effect of baclofen for spasticity reduction. Recent studies in the psychiatric literature indicate that baclofen has an anxiolytic action in certain psychopathologic conditions. Clinical observation has shown that manifestations of spasticity are increased in anxious individuals, implicating a supraspinal site of mediation for these responses. The purposes of this study were to determine if baclofen reduced anxiety in individuals with traumatic spinal cord lesions and whether that reduction was correlated with decreased spasticity from the baclofen. Five adult males with traumatic spinal cord injury were randomly assigned to the study protocol. A double-blind, repeated measures, multiple base-line, single-case research design was employed. The independent variable was dose of medication with the three levels being placebo, 40 mg/day of baclofen and 80 mg/day of baclofen, in four evenly divided doses. The dependent variable was the score obtained on the Beck Inventory-A anxiety scale (BIA). The subjects were administered the BIA twice per week for a nine-week period of time, during which they received the doses of medication as described. Quantitative measurements of spasticity were also taken at each session. Visual inspection analysis of the data showed that two subjects had no measurable anxiety of the BIA throughout the study. Three subjects had measurable anxiety on the BIA during the base-line/placebo phase. They showed a decreased level of their BIA scores with 40 mg/day of baclofen, and a further level reduction with 80 mg/day of baclofen. The reduction in BIA scores was statistically significant using the standard deviation band test in one of these subjects. These data indicate that BIA probably has an anxiolytic effect for individuals status post-traumatic spinal cord injury. ",3
"Early diagnosis and survival of ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysms. The hospital records of patients treated with ruptured abdominal aortic aneurysm in a recent 5-year period were reviewed to collect data on factors which may be associated with mortality. Overall mortality was 62%. Patients with intraperitoneal rupture had a higher mortality (97%) than patients with retroperitoneal rupture (25%). Patients at increased risk were older than 80 years, presented with syncope, experienced a short duration of symptoms prior to emergency department (ED) arrival, had initial systolic blood pressure less than 90 mm Hg, and/or initial hemoglobin level less than eight on arrival at the ED and delay in beginning surgery. Multivariate analysis demonstrated preoperative blood pressure, preoperative hemoglobin, presence of syncope, and the amount of blood transfused were largely reflections of the type of rupture and had only slight independent relationship to mortality. The authors concluded that treating emergency physicians and surgeons have little control over the most important risk factors for mortality after aneurysm rupture, but may improve the prognosis by expediting diagnosis in the ED and surgical therapy.

"Recurrent transient ischemic attacks and stroke in association with an internal carotid artery web Fibromuscular dysplasia is a nonatherosclerotic vascular disease that most commonly affects cervical carotid arteries at the C1-C2 level when cephalic arteries are involved. Several histopathologic and angiographic subtypes of fibromuscular dysplasia exist; most have a benign natural history. We describe the third reported case of a pathologically proven, symptomatic proximal internal carotid artery web and suggest that patients with this lesion are at a higher risk for stroke. ",4
"Human T-cell leukemia virus type I infection as an oncogenic and prognostic risk factor in cervical and vaginal carcinoma. The seroprevalence of human T-cell leukemia virus type I (HTLV-I) antibody in 6701 healthy females and 226 women with gynecologic malignancies, all living in an adult T-cell leukemia-endemic area in southwestern Japan, was investigated to determine whether HTLV-I infection was a risk factor influencing oncogenesis and prognosis. The seroprevalences in cervical carcinoma patients younger than 59 years and in vaginal carcinoma patients of all ages were significantly higher than in age-matched healthy controls. The ratios of observed to expected HTLV-I seroprevalence in patients younger than 59 with cervical carcinoma and in vaginal carcinoma patients were 2.92 and 7.36, respectively. Among the patients with cervical carcinoma or vaginal carcinoma, the tumor recurrence rate in HTLV-I carriers was significantly higher than that in HTLV-I seronegative patients. Our results suggest that HTLV-I infection may be oncogenic and may affect the prognosis in some patients with cervical or vaginal carcinoma. ",1
"Selection of patients with stage B prostate cancer for radical prostatectomy. There are several areas of concern in dealing with clinical stage B disease. First, understaging is common. Second, recognition of extension into the seminal vesicles is important. Third, the patient's predicted life expectancy must be taken into account. Moreover, even clinically localized prostate cancer may have metastasized, and the need for surgical staging by lymph node dissection has been a significant factor in the authors' preference for radical retropubic rather than radical perineal prostatectomy. Neither of the two serum markers in clinical use is an absolute predictor of stage. Analysis of tumor ploidy may prove useful, and transrectal ultrasound warrants further study. In the elderly patient, the urologist certainly may elect to monitor the tumor without definitely deciding on operative versus conservative treatment. ",1
"The role of gastric resection in the management of multicentric argyrophil gastric carcinoids. A patient with pernicious anemia, atrophic non-antral gastritis, hypergastrinemia, and widespread hyperplasia of enterochromaffin-like cells and manifest enterochromaffin-like cell carcinoma was followed up during 39 months, including 15 months after gastric resection. In this case normalization of gastrin levels did not prevent the development of multiple gastric carcinoids in the fundic mucosa, suggesting that factors other than gastrin are of importance in the pathogenesis.

"The Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. A functionally viable reconstructive procedure in children who have a tumor of the distal end of the femur. Twelve patients who had a malignant tumor of the distal end of the femur were treated with a Van Nes tibial rotationplasty. The survival rates were comparable with those for above-the-knee amputees and patients who had an endoprosthetic replacement. The results of functional testing showed that these patients performed as well as those who had endoprosthetic replacement and better than those who had above-the-knee amputation. Rotationplasty is therefore a favorable alternative to amputation or endoprosthetic replacement, either as a primary or as a salvage procedure. ",1
"Initial therapy of patients with Wilson's disease with tetrathiomolybdate. Patients with Wilson's disease who present with acute neurological symptoms often become clinically worse when initially treated with penicillamine. Other available anticopper drug therapies do not appear to offer a solution to this treatment problem. We are developing and evaluating a new drug, ammonium tetrathiomolybdate for this purpose. Theoretically, tetrathiomolybdate has optimal properties, including an immediate blockade of copper absorption and the property of forming complexes with copper in the blood, rendering the copper nontoxic. In this article, we present results from six patients treated with tetrathiomolybdate for up to 8 weeks as initial therapy. None of the five patients who had presented with acute neurological symptoms worsened. Also presented are methods of assay, preliminary stability studies, and methods of evaluating therapeutic end points with respect to copper metabolism. ",3
"Pyloric deformation from peptic disease. Radiographic evidence for incompetence rather than obstruction. We have used double-contrast radiographic techniques to clarify what changes in the configuration and movements of the gastroduodenal junction result when peptic lesions involve the distal gastric segment between the proximal (PPL) and the distal pyloric muscle loop (DPL). Among 50 cases of pyloric ulceration diagnosed during a four-year study period, 18 cases fulfilled all study criteria. Ulcers maintained a consistent location with regard to the muscular structures of the pylorus, and by affecting these structures, led to many strange deformations of the gastric outlet including permanent pseudodiverticula and reversal of pyloric angulation. The most common site for peptic lesions in the pyloric segment was the protuberance of the lesser curvature called the pyloric torus; many torus lesions extended into and destroyed the DPL. This led to widening of the gastric outlet and radiographic evidence of increased duodenogastric reflux. Pyloric closure was further impaired in this setting because the mucosa no longer prolapsed into the gastric outlet and did not occlude the pyloric lumen as it normally does. Less common lesions involved the greater curvature and the PPL. In one patient, scarring of the PPL led to an antral web and gastric hyperperistalsis. This was the only patient who required operation for chronic gastric outlet obstruction. One-third of the 18 patients had reflux esophagitis in addition to peptic pyloric disease. In most patients without additional ulcerogenic risk factors, treatment with antisecretory agents led to the healing of ulcer craters. We conclude that the morphologic and functional changes of the gastric outlet caused by peptic lesions depend, in part, on the effect the ulcer has on the underlying pyloric musculature. ",5
"Neuroexcitatory plasma amino acids are elevated in migraine. To investigate the role of glutamic (Glu) and aspartic acid (Asp) in migraine, we measured the plasma amino acids in migraine patients with and without aura, between and during attacks, and compared the profiles with the plasma amino acid profiles of tension headache patients and healthy controls. Between attacks, migraineurs (notably with aura) had substantially higher plasma Glu and Asp levels than did controls and tension headache patients. In addition, patients with migraine without aura showed low plasma histidine levels. During migraine attacks, Glu (and to a lesser extent Asp) levels were even further increased. The results suggest a defective cellular reuptake mechanism for Glu and Asp in migraineurs, and we hypothesize a similar defect at the neuronal/glial cell level, predisposing the brain of migraineurs to develop spreading depression.

"The determinants and prognostic significance of serum uric acid in elderly patients of the European Working Party on High Blood Pressure in the Elderly trial. Determinants and risks associated with serum uric acid were investigated in 822 elderly hypertensive patients treated with hydrochlorothiazide and triamterene or placebo. Pretreatment serum uric acid levels were significantly higher in men than in women and had positive correlation with serum creatinine. After adjustment for serum creatinine, positive correlations of serum uric acid with body weight and fasting blood glucose in women and with serum cholesterol in men were significant. During follow-up, serum uric acid increased significantly in the treated patients, but remained unchanged in the placebo group. Total, cardiovascular, and noncardiovascular mortality were unrelated to initial serum uric acid levels. One placebo patient and seven treated patients developed gout. Of those seven, most were male patients and had significantly higher serum levels of uric acid and creatinine than the other patients. Gender and renal function were the major determinants of serum uric acid in elderly hypertensive patients. ",4
Cystic medionecrosis of the coronary arteries and fatal coronary vasospasm. The histopathological basis of coronary vasospasm is not well defined. We report a patient with directly observed coronary artery spasm in whom cystic medionecrosis of the coronary arteries and great vessels and myxomatous degeneration of the mitral valve were evident. We suggest that myxoid connective tissue lesions of the heart may be linked to coronary vasospasm. ,4
"Nasal valve malfunction resulting from resection of cancer. Following cancer resection of the nasal unit, nasal valve malfunction is manifested by the symptoms of nasal stuffiness or difficulty getting air into the nostril. These symptoms occur in cases in which the resection is in the alar crease at the junction with the lateral sidewall of the nose. Wound scar contracture elevates the alar margin and causes the alar and lateral cartilages to move inward forming a visible and palpable shelf on the lateral wall of the nasal vestibule. This displacement of the alar and lateral cartilages and the rigid scar formed between these cartilages render the nasal valve immobile. Since it is easier to prevent nasal valve malfunction than to repair it later, wounds that bridge the alar crease or are located in either the alae or lateral sidewall and come within 1 mm of the alar crease with a total diameter of 1.0 cm should be repaired to prevent nasal valve malfunction. In the process of repairing deep defects, the overlapping region of the lateral crus of the alar cartilage and the lateral cartilage may be stabilized by a conchal cartilage graft. This cartilage graft may be used in combination with reconstruction of the nasal skin with a forehead flap and repair of the nasal lining. In the event that the nasal lining is intact, the cartilage graft may be used with a full-thickness skin graft. ",5
"Surgical treatment of low rectovaginal fistulas. Forty women with low rectovaginal fistulas were operated upon over a 9-year period. The etiology of the fistula in the majority was obstetric. Nine women had prior attempts to repair the fistula. All 40 women were managed with endorectal advancement flap with the addition of sphincteroplasty or perineal body reconstruction in 15 patients and rectocele repair in six patients. Postoperative complications included urinary difficulties (two patients) and wound complications (three patients). There were two recurrences. All women treated with sphincteroplasty or perineal body reconstruction were continent. Seven women complained of varying degrees of incontinence postoperatively; none had undergone sphincter or perineal body reconstruction. Endorectal advancement flap is a safe and effective operation for women with rectovaginal fistulas. Concomitant sphincteroplasty or perineal body reconstruction should be performed in women with historical, physical, or manometric evidence of incontinence. ",2
"Embolization with particles in thoracic intramedullary arteriovenous malformations: long-term angiographic and clinical results. To evaluate the long-term results of endovascular treatment with particles in the management of thoracic intramedullary arteriovenous malformations (AVMs), the authors retrospectively reviewed the angiographic and clinical findings in 35 patients. Follow-up was 1-15 years (mean, 6 years) in 28 patients and 6-10 months (mean, 7 months) in seven. A total of 158 embolization procedures were performed in 35 patients. Revascularization occurred frequently, necessitating multiple endovascular sessions. Long-term clinical evaluation showed clinical improvement, compared with the initial status before treatment, in 63% of the patients. Clinical aggravation due to embolization was observed in seven patients (20%) after 12 of the 158 endovascular sessions (8%). These results are better than those reported after surgery and indicate that embolization with particles is an efficient and safe tool in the treatment of thoracic intramedullary AVMs. ",4
"Effects of nimodipine on infarct size and cerebral acidosis after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. The objective of this study was to determine the effect of nimodipine on infarct development and local brain pH after middle cerebral artery occlusion in the rat. Female Fischer-344 rats were subjected to permanent occlusion of the left middle cerebral artery by electrocoagulation. After 6, 12, or 24 hours, brains were frozen, and infarct size, degree of edema formation, and local brain pH were quantified by standard histology or the umbelliferone technique, respectively. In control rats, cortical infarct size was increased from 29.5 microliters at 6 hours to 72.5 microliters at 24 hours after vessel occlusion. In striatum only, an insignificant increase from 15.2 to 24.7 microliters in infarct volume was observed during this period. Edema increased from 7% to 22% in cortical and from 4% to 39% in the striatal infarct areas during this time. Nimodipine (0.1 mg/kg s.c.), given 45 minutes before and again 8 and 16 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, did not alter infarct size at 6 hours but considerably improved outcome at later times. Edema formation was lower at 12 hours in the group treated with the calcium antagonist (p less than 0.05). By contrast, effects on local brain pH were seen as early as 6 hours after the vessel occlusion. Nimodipine greatly reduced the areas exhibiting the lowest pH values beyond pH 6.0 (p less than 0.05). Similar effects by nimodipine on brain pH were observed in the 12-hour series, whereas at 24 hours after middle cerebral artery occlusion, a shift to more alkalotic values was noted with no overt differences between control and drug-treated groups.

"Fatal or severely disabling cerebral infarction during hospitalization for stroke or transient ischemic attack. Six (1%) of 578 patients admitted for cerebral infarction or transient ischemic attack (TIA) suffered a fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction following a period of stabilization or improvement lasting more than 1 day. These infarctions were characterized by the sudden onset of stupor or coma and subsequent development of transtentorial herniation due to carotid or middle cerebral artery territory infarction, or widespread brain-stem infarction due to basilar occlusion. Only one patient survived. Four patients had large-vessel disease documented by Doppler, angiography, or at autopsy. Each of these six infarcts occurred during the morning hours, 4-9 days after the initial event, 3-8 days after initiation of intravenous heparin, and within 4-8 h after intravenous heparin had been discontinued. No coagulation abnormalities were documented. We believe that these cases indicate that among patients admitted for cerebral infarction or TIA, fatal or severely disabling in-hospital cerebral infarction after a period of stabilization or improvement may occur in patients having an initially mild to moderate clinical deficit, that those suffering large artery disease may be at greater risk, and that there may be a relationship between heparin withdrawal and cerebral infarction in some patients.

"The human immunodeficiency virus type 1 polyadenylylation signal: a 3' long terminal repeat element upstream of the AAUAAA necessary for efficient polyadenylylation. Several polyadenylylation (PA) signals containing elements upstream of the AAUAAA have recently been characterized. Similar to PA elements found downstream of the AAUAAA, the upstream elements function to increase efficiency of AAUAAA use as a signal for cleavage and PA. Using deletion and linker scanning mutations we show that the PA signal of human immunodeficiency virus type 1 contains upstream elements transcribed from the U3 region of the 3' long terminal repeat. The element that has the greatest effect on PA site use lies 77 to 94 nucleotides upstream of the AAUAAA, between the TATA element and the transcriptional initiation site. Mutations in the adjacent region, between 59 and 76 nucleotides upstream of the AAUAAA, have a smaller effect on PA efficiency. Mutations in a region further upstream, between 141 and 176 nucleotides upstream of the AAUAAA, also affected PA modestly. Functional similarity between upstream elements was indicated by the ability of the human immunodeficiency virus upstream region to replace the upstream region of the simian virus 40 late PA signal. The sequence of the major upstream element of human immunodeficiency virus is uracil-rich, analogous to many defined downstream PA elements. This fact may imply that upstream and downstream elements have similar mechanisms of action. ",5
"Primary de novo adenocarcinoma of the colon measuring 8 mm in diameter with lymph node metastases. Report of a case. Colonic adenocarcinomas measuring less than 10 mm are rare. Herein, we report a carcinoma measuring 8 mm in diameter associated with subserosal extension through a ""locus minoris resistentiae"" and metastases to lymph nodes, an association not previously reported. No residual adenomatous tissue was found, suggesting a de novo carcinoma. ",1
"Mammographic measurements before and after augmentation mammaplasty. Thirty-five augmented women underwent mammography using both the standard implant-compression technique and, when possible, the implant-displacement technique; all had preaugmentation film-screen mammography available for evaluation. The area of mammographically visualized breast tissue before and after augmentation mammaplasty was measured using a transparent grid. Patients with subglandular implants had a mean decrease of 49 percent of measurable tissue area with compression mammography and a 39 percent decrease with displacement mammography. Patients with submuscular implants had a 28 percent decrease in measurable tissue area with compression mammography and a 9 percent decrease with displacement mammography. Anterior breast tissue was seen better with displacement mammography; posterior breast tissue, with compression mammography. Most patients had some degree of parenchymal scarring and lower image quality after augmentation. State-of-the-art mammography was not possible in most patients augmented with silicone-gel-filled implants. ",1
"SPECT imaging of pediatric brain tumor with hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium (I). Technetium-99m-Hexamibi [Hexakis (methoxyisobutylisonitrile) technetium (i)] was developed as a myocardial perfusion agent with biologic properties similar to those of thallium-201 (201TI). As 201TI has recently been observed to be of value for the diagnosis of brain tumors when used in conjunction with single-photon emission computed tomography (SPECT) imaging technology, the possibility that the biologic similarity of the two radiopharmaceuticals extended to their affinity for tumors was tested. A 5-yr-old female patient with a brain stem astrocytoma showed marked focal uptake of 99mTc-Hexamibi at the site of tumor recurrence as defined by biopsy and prior 201TI/SPECT study. Tumor-to-normal cortex radioactivity ratios for the 99mTc-Hexamibi/SPECT study were 132:1 and the spatial resolution of the 99mTc-Hexamibi images was high. This observation suggests that 99mTc-Hexamibi merits further study as a potential agent for SPECT imaging of human brain tumors. ",1
"Cross-linked hemoglobin solution as a resuscitative fluid after hemorrhage in the rat. Intramolecularly (alpha-alpha) cross-linked hemoglobin has been reported to have oxygen transport properties similar to those of whole blood. The present study evaluated the efficacy of diaspirin alpha-alpha cross-linked hemoglobin solution as a resuscitation fluid, with heart rate, mean arterial pressure, and transcutaneous oxygen tension as the study parameters. Rats were bled and approximately one third of their total blood volume (20 ml/kg) was removed while they were anesthetized; they were then resuscitated with 14% hemoglobin solution. Animals that received either 10 mg/kg (n = 10) or 20 mg/kg (n = 10) of hemoglobin solution responded quickly and positively to the infusions: mean arterial pressure (which had dropped to less than 40% of prehemorrhage levels) returned to baseline within 2 minutes of initiating infusion; by 4 minutes, the mean arterial pressures of the hemoglobin-infused groups were significantly higher (p less than or equal to 0.05) than those in both the autologous shed blood (n = 8) and lactated Ringer's (n = 10) groups. The heart rate and transcutaneous oxygen tension responses in both the half-volume and full-volume replacement hemoglobin groups matched the response to autologous shed blood throughout the hour of observation. The favorable hemodynamic response to infusion of cross-linked hemoglobin solution after hemorrhage suggests that this material is comparable to autologous shed blood and superior to lactated Ringer's solution as a resuscitative fluid as assessed in this model.

"Amyloidosis of the small intestine: findings on double-contrast radiographs. The appearance of the small intestinal mucosa on double-contrast barium examinations was studied in 26 patients with proved intestinal amyloidosis. Findings included innumerable fine granular densities 1-3 mm in diameter (16 patients), multiple nodular densities 3-4 mm in diameter (four patients), multiple polypoid protrusions 4-10 mm in diameter (three patients), irregularities of Kerckring folds (12 patients), and multiple erosions (eight patients). The multiple nodular densities and erosions disappeared after the patients were treated with total parenteral nutrition. The other abnormalities remained unchanged on follow-up examinations. Our results indicate that double-contrast radiographic findings of the small intestine in patients with amyloidosis include mucosal abnormalities that vary according to the pathologic type of amyloid deposition.

"IgA triggers tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by monocytes: a study in normal subjects and patients with alcoholic cirrhosis. Under endotoxin-free conditions, peripheral blood mononuclear cells and purified monocytes isolated from healthy control subjects and patients with alcoholic cirrhosis disclose elevated tumor necrosis factor alpha messenger RNA level and produce tumor necrosis factor alpha in response to stimulation by either soluble polymeric IgA or monomeric IgA bound to the surface of culture dishes but not by soluble monomeric IgA. Polymeric IgA induces tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion in a dose-dependent fashion. These results suggest that cross-linking of Fc alpha receptors on human monocytes induces the messenger RNA accumulation and the secretion of the cytotoxic and immunoregulatory cytokine tumor necrosis factor alpha. Furthermore, it is shown that lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion by peripheral blood mononuclear cells is synergistically enhanced in the presence of solid phase monomeric IgA but not in the presence of either soluble monomeric or polymeric IgA. Although increased lipopolysaccharide-induced tumor necrosis factor alpha secretion is observed at baseline in alcoholic cirrhotic patients, this synergism is also expressed in this group of patients. These observations could be of pathophysiological relevance in alcoholic cirrhosis because monomeric IgA deposits along the liver sinusoids and increased serum levels of polymeric IgA are common even in the early stages of this disease.

"Glomerular IgA deposits in patients with celiac disease. Glomerular immunopathology was studied in 25 patients with newly diagnosed celiac disease. None had clinical signs of renal disease. Glomeruli were obtained by fine-needle aspiration biopsy. The specimens were processed and studied by indirect immunofluorescence for immunoglobulins and complement. Mesangial IgA was found in 8 of the patients. It occurred occasionally together with slight IgG or IgM, but C3 was not seen in these patients. IgA-class circulating immune complexes (CIC), antireticulin antibodies (ARA), antigliadin antibodies (AGA), and rheumatoid factor (RF) occurred significantly more often in the patients with mesangial IgA than in the 17 patients having no mesangial IgA. The patients with mesangial IgA also had significantly higher mean levels of serum IgA, IgA-ARA and IgA-AGA than those without. The results suggest that glomerular mesangial deposits of IgA occur frequently in untreated celiac disease and that they are in some way associated with circulating IgA-class antibodies and immune complexes. In this situation IgA seems to be deposited without being able to induce clinically overt glomerulonephritis, a circumstance that may be related to the lack of complement in the deposits. ",2
"Primary defect in alpha-adrenergic responsiveness in patients with varicose veins. Responsiveness of superficial hand veins to local infusions of noradrenaline was compared in patients with primary varicose veins and in healthy volunteers by use of the dorsal hand vein technique. Patients with varicose veins required significantly higher doses of noradrenaline for half-maximal venoconstriction than the dose required by control subjects (geometric mean, 11.6 ng/min in patients compared with 4.8 ng/min in control subjects; p = 0.006). Noradrenaline responsiveness in varicose veins was not significantly different from hand vein responsiveness in the same patients. Our findings indicate a constitutional decrease in venous alpha-adrenergic receptor responsiveness in patients with varicosities. Dilation of varicose veins does not further affect noradrenaline-induced venoconstriction. ",4
"Use of a computerized closed-loop sodium nitroprusside titration system for antihypertensive treatment after open heart surgery. This study evaluates the clinical applicability of administering sodium nitroprusside by a closed-loop titration system compared with a manually adjusted system. The mean arterial pressure (MAP) was registered every 10 and 30 sec during the first 150 min after open heart surgery in 20 patients (group 1: computer regulation) and in ten patients (group 2: manual regulation). The results (16,343 and 2,912 data points in groups 1 and 2, respectively), were then analyzed in four time frames and five pressure ranges to indicate clinical efficacy. Sixty percent of the measured MAP in both groups was within the desired +/- 10% during the first 10 min. Thereafter until the end of observation, the MAP was maintained within +/- 10% of the desired set-point 90% of the time in group 1 vs. 60% of the time in group 2. One percent and 11% of data points were +/- 20% from the set-point in groups 1 and 2, respectively (p less than .05, chi-square test). The computer-assisted therapy provided better control of MAP, was safe to use, and helped to reduce nursing demands. ",4
"Extensive peripheral retinectomy combined with posterior 360 degrees retinotomy for retinal reattachment in advanced proliferative vitreoretinopathy cases. Posterior 360 degrees retinotomy in conjunction with extensive peripheral retinectomy was necessary for retinal reattachment in 18 eyes. A visual acuity of 20/400 or better was achieved in 22% of the patients; in patients with rubeosis, regression was found in 89%. Of the hypotonus eyes, preoperatively 78% were normotensive postoperatively after removal of anterior proliferative vitreoretinopathy (PVR) covering ciliary epithelium. The major intraoperative complication was hemorrhage, which could be readily controlled. Recurrent retinal detachment (RD) occurred in 39% and reproliferation in 50% of the patients. ",5
"Natural history of progressive ischemic stroke in a population treated with heparin Data on the acute natural history of progressive stroke with or without heparin treatment are limited. To define the acute course of patients treated with heparin for progressive stroke, we examined the charts of 69 such patients identified through the Cornell Neurology Database from October 1979 to June 1985. Analysis included determining whether further clinical deterioration or hemorrhagic complications were associated with readily identifiable clinical or laboratory variables. Twenty-five patients (36%) continued to deteriorate while receiving heparin, another two (3%) worsened due to intracerebral hemorrhage, and a total of 10 patients (14%) had bleeding complications. No clinical features or heparin dosing regimens distinguished the patients likely to benefit from heparin. Clinical progression or hemorrhage did not correlate with the level of anticoagulation as measured by the average heparin dose per day or the mean partial thromboplastin time. Without unequivocal evidence demonstrating heparin's ineffectiveness for progressive stroke, many clinicians managing such patients will continue to use heparin. Our results suggest that this decision should not be governed by such clinical features as a patient's age or sex or by the vascular distribution of the stroke. Furthermore, frequent measurement of and overzealous efforts to adjust the partial thromboplastin time may be unnecessary since it does not correlate with outcome. ",3
"Clinical and manometric aspects of diffuse esophageal spasm in a cohort of subjects evaluated for dysphagia and/or chest pain. Manometric criteria for diffuse esophageal spasm have recently been restated. In this study, a cohort of 358 subjects was evaluated in a gastrointestinal motility laboratory for dysphagia and/or chest pain. Applying the recently proposed criteria of Richter and Castell, 18 subjects (5%) were diagnosed as having DES. Dysphagia was the major complaint (89%), while 44% of patients complained of chest pain and 33% of both symptoms. All patients shared more than 30% simultaneous contractions after wet swallows interspersed with normal peristaltic sequences. Associated manometric findings were repetitive (greater than 3 peaks) contractions (67%), high-amplitude contractions (33%), spontaneous activity (22%), prolonged duration (11%), and lower esophageal sphincter abnormalities (5%). Radiology disclosed significant abnormalities in only 27% of DES patients. ",2
"A blood-liquid interface for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation with excellent antithrombogenicity. The authors verified the excellent antithrombogenicity of a blood-liquid interface (BLI) and introduced an oxygenator based on the principle of gas exchange across direct BLI. In a newly developed oxygenator, three layers of liquid flowed horizontally, contacting one another: O2 saturated silicone oil on the top, O2 saturated fluorcarbon at the bottom, and blood in the middle. Gas exchange was carried out across both direct BLIs. This system provided excellent antithrombogenicity as well as good gas exchange. The results indicate that this method will become a promising modality for prolonged extracorporeal oxygenation. ",4
"Fetal choroid plexus cysts: a prospective study and review of the literature. To determine the incidence and significance of fetal choroid plexus cysts, a prospective study was carried out at Queen's Medical Centre, Nottingham. The incidence of cysts was found to be 0.42% and the size of cysts varied from 3 to 13 mm with a mean diameter of 6.2 mm. Choroid plexus cysts were associated with other fetal abnormalities in three cases, two of which were subsequently found to have a chromosomal abnormality, one Trisomy 18 and one Trisomy 21. A review of the reported cases of choroid plexus cysts reveals an overall incidence of 5.8% for Trisomy 18. We therefore recommend that in patients with choroid plexus cysts a detailed scan should be carried out to look for the ultrasound markers of Trisomy 18. If there is an associated abnormality or cysts are large (13 mm or greater in diameter) and bilateral then a karyotyping should be carried out. ",3
"The influence of warning signal timing and cognitive preparation on the aversiveness of electric shock. Many medical and dental procedures are noxious. Finding an optimal way of warning patients concerning the aversive procedures could help them to cope better. A model for the effective use of a warning signal in coping with pain posited that a person needs enough time to be able to react and should possess the skills necessary to utilize the time effectively. It was felt that a very short warning period, e.g., 5 sec, could not be long enough, while a 180 sec warning period would in and of itself become aversive. Reactions to electric shock were obtained from 36 paid, volunteer subjects who were each tested on a within-subject, counterbalanced order at 4 different warning periods: 5, 30, 60, and 180 sec. The subjects were divided into 3 groups: (1) the experimental group was provided with a pretested self-instructional booklet to learn a variety of pain control techniques; (2) the placebo group was provided with a self-instructional booklet on citizenship; (3) the control group waited quietly for 13 min. No significant results were obtained for the different pain-coping conditions. Significant differences, however, were obtained for the various warning periods. Maximum skin resistance changes, higher ratings of pain and of anxiety were obtained for the 60 and 180 compared to the 5 and 30 sec warning periods. Maximum heart rate was obtained for the 30 sec warning. Results were discussed in terms of the psychological meaning of the various measures as well as their clinical implications. ",3
